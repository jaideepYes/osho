THE DEW ON THE LOTUS LEAF\nUNDYED BY ITS COLOUR, JUST AS IT IS,\nIS THE REAL FORM OF BUDDHA.\nAn elderly woman came into a doctor’s office, exclaiming, “Doctor, my stomach hurts!” The doctor said, “But madam, I am a doctor of philosophy.”\nFor a moment she forgot the pain, and then seemed puzzled. “Philosophy? What kind of disease is that?”\nYES, PHILOSOPHY IS A DISEASE, and not an ordinary one either. It is not a common cold, it is cancer – cancer of the soul. Once a person is lost in the jungle of philosophy he becomes more and more entangled in words, concepts, abstractions. And there is no end to it, one can go on and on for lives together.\nPhilosophy is all a mind game; mind perpetuates through it. And the truth can be known only when you are in a state of no-mind. So the philosopher never comes to know the truth. Unless philosophy is dropped utterly, in toto, one cannot know what truth is or what God is.\nPhilosophy thinks ABOUT God and hence goes on missing God. It goes on spinning and weaving theories around and around; it never hits the target. It moves in circles – it creates one idea about God, and then that idea creates another idea... and ideas don’t believe in birth control; they go on reproducing themselves.\nMind secretes philosophy, creates philosophy, lives through it. Without philosophy the mind cannot exist for even a single moment. The mind HAS to be a Hindu or a Mohammedan or a Christian or a communist. The mind cannot remain for even a single moment in existence if it is not Hindu, not Mohammedan, not Jain, not Christian. If the mind has no philosophy to depend on, it dies out of starvation. If there are no props to support it, if a continuous nourishment is not given to it so that it can think more and more, the process stops. Philosophy keeps it going.\nBuddhism is not a philosophy – not at least in Buddha’s being or in Ikkyu’s being. Those who have realized have realized one thing absolutely, that truth happens in a non-philosophic state. Truth\nhappens in a state of not-knowing, truth happens in innocence. Truth happens when there are no clouds of thoughts moving in your consciousness, when the sky is absolutely clear, when there is no abstraction, when you have no idea what God is or what God is not – when you don’t believe in God and you don’t believe in no-God, when you are simply in a state of not-knowing. You don’t claim any knowledge: that non-claiming consciousness begins to open up. All knowledge burdens and closes you.\nAnd Zen is one of the medicines for coming out of the disease called philosophy. No other school has been able to devise such powerful medicines for coming out of the world of philosophy as Zen has done.\nBuddha did not teach anything to believe in. He was not a teacher in that sense, because he did not teach. He was, on the contrary, an anti-teacher – he took away a]l the teachings that people were carrying. Slowly slowly, he helped his disciples to become utterly nude, naked.\nPhilosophy is a beautiful dress that the mind clings to. Once philosophy is dropped, mind is ugly. No one would like it, it is nauseous. Then to drop the mind becomes very easy – in fact to cling to it becomes impossible. One HAS to drop it; that dropping comes inevitably and necessarily, of its own accord.\nWhat exactly is philosophy? It is a pretension of knowing, without knowing anything at all. It is thinking. Thinking always means the man is ignorant but is trying to make up something. Whenever you think, that simply shows you don’t know. Either you know or you don’t. How can you think? What can you think?\nIf I say, “Does God exist or not?” and you say to me, “I will think over it” what are you going to think over? Either you know or you don’t – it is just simple like that. What are you going to think about? And whatsoever you think will be your fabrication, will be a lie. Thinking consists of lies.\nBut one can prove to oneself that those lies are truths; one can argue for them. In fact truth needs no argument. Truth is self-evident; only lies need arguments – they are not self-evident, they need witnesses. A truth is simply truth; unarguably it is there.\nThat’s why the greatest declarations of truth are absolutely without any argument. In the Old Testament there is no argument for God. It simply states: God is. No argument is given, no proofs are contrived. The Upanishads simply declare; they are declarations, announcements to the world at large, but with no argumentation behind them. They are not syllogisms, just poetic assertions. Somebody has known, and he declares. If you ask him, “What is the proof?” he says, “You can also know.”\nWhen Vivekananda reached Ramakrishna, he asked this question: “Can you prove to me that God exists?” And Ramakrishna said, “I cannot prove that God exists, but I can make you KNOW. Are you ready? This very moment!”\nVivekananda was shaken to his very roots. The man was standing there and asking, “Are you ready? THIS very moment I can show God to you! but there is no proof.” Vivekananda had not expected this. He had seen many other philosophers before; he was expecting something like that\nRamakrishna would give a few proofs, would argue for God, would destroy the proofs that say God does not exist. He had never come across a man of real knowledge; this was the first time.\nHis throat went dry, he could not utter a single word, he was simply dumb. For a moment everything stopped. And Ramakrishna touched his chest with his feet and he fell into deep ecstasy. When he came back he was trembling. What he had seen was impossible to believe – he had fallen out of the mind for a moment. That touch of Ramakrishna’s feet: for a moment he had fallen out of the mind.\nJust the same happened last night. Sarjano was there – and Vivekananda must have been in exactly the same situation as Sarjano was last night – and I told him to hold my feet in his hands for a moment, and it happened. For a moment he slipped out of the mind.\nThe impact of no-mind, if you are ready, can take you into a state of no-mind. And there is knowing. Knowing is not through the mind, it is always through the no-mind; it is not through the knower, it is only when the knower is not.\nAnd philosophy goes on accepting the knower and goes on trying to make some toys – theories, doctrines to believe in – so that one can deceive oneself. And one can go on and on, for ever and for ever.\nI have heard:\nAn ignoramus managed to get himself invited to a party attended by world-renowned scientists. Among them was Albert Einstein. The illiterate guest immediately made a nuisance of himself by dogging the illustrious physicist’s heels and offering what he thought were very profound observations.\n“Tell me, Doctor Einstein,” asked the pest, “what, in your opinion, is the difference between time and eternity?”\n“Sir,” answered Einstein, “if I took the time to explain the difference, it would take an eternity!”\nIn fact Einstein is being very mild, mellow, generous. Even in an eternity, the difference cannot be explained. Even through an eternity, if you go on discussing “What is time?” and “What is eternity?” you are not going to come to any conclusion whatsoever.\nFive thousand years of philosophy, and not a single conclusion in the hands. Yes, not a single conclusion. No two philosophers agree; they only agree to disagree. They are constantly arguing against each other. There is no possibility of agreement, because two lies cannot agree. And two truths agree so deeply that they become one truth – then they are not two, the agreement is so total. That’s why it is said that there is only one truth. There cannot be many, because the agreement is so infinite and so total and so whole that whenever there are two truths they immediately jump into one and become one flame.\nAll Buddhas agree. But on what? – that cannot be said. If you say it, it becomes part of philosophy. It remains unsaid, but it can be experienced.\nBecause philosophy is a pretension, it believes in great words. It believes in phrase-mongering – it creates, fabricates, great words that people can be impressed by.\nArt Critic I: “I think the neo-plasticism of the abstract design proves the mystical, metaphysical and non-humanistic approach to the objective concept of abstraction.”\nArt Critic 2: “Yes, you have a point there! In fact, it’s obvious even from a casual glance that this painting was created by paranoiac-critical activity, brought about by spontaneous dynamic sensations, sometimes made by somnambulistically inclined campanologists, who create a picture of transcendental non-curvilinear and curvilinear objects expressing subjective feelings in a cubistic manner.”\nArt Critic 3: “I fully agree with you both – it’s a rubbishy painting!”\nPhilosophy goes on creating such bombastic words; it is never simple, it cannot be. It cannot afford to be simple because if it is simple you will see that it is a lie. It has to be very very roundabout, indirect, zig-zag – never straight, never to the point. Its whole effort is not to come to the point: just go on in every direction, but never come home. And create such bombastic words that you can impress idiots – only idiots are impressed by those bombastic words.\nTruth is simple. Very simple – so simple that a child can understand it. In fact, so simple that only a child can understand it. Unless you become a child again you will not be able to understand it. It is an experience, not speculation.\nBut once you get addicted to great words it is very very difficult to bring you down to the earth. Those big words give great fulfillment to your ego. Once a person’s mind starts enjoying great words and great ideas and complicated theories, it is very difficult for him to descend to the earth. He flies in the skies, he remains in the high towers of his mind; he never comes to the fact, to the truth. Because truth is simple – and what will happen to his philosophy?\nSamantha was a six-year-old who liked to exaggerate almost everything she saw or did. One day she was looking out of the window when she called to her mother, “Mummy, Mummy! Come quickly! There’s a lion walking on the road outside our house!”\nSamantha’s mother looked out of the window but could only see a small ginger cat.\n“Samantha! You’re lying again!” she scolded. “Go upstairs to your room immediately and pray to God for forgiveness for being such a naughty little girl, and beg him to stop you from telling so many lies.”\nSamantha ran up to her room sobbing. A short time later she came down to her mother and said, “I’ve prayed to God like you said, Mummy. And he said that he, too, thought the ginger cat looked rather like a lion.”\nOnce you have started enjoying exaggerations, big words, bombastic theories, it will be difficult for you. You will try to collect every kind of proof to convince yourself and others that you are on the right track. Once the illusion that you know happens to you – and that is the illusion philosophy\ngives, that you know – then it is very hard to drop that illusion, because then you become ignorant again.\nThat is one of the most difficult things for you in being with me. When you come, you come with knowledge. And the whole effort here is to help you drop that knowledge. You come here to acquire a little MORE knowledge, not to drop that which you have. You come to accumulate a little more; you come to gather a few more arguments for that which you already believe. And I am telling you to drop all that you know – because you don’t really know; it is a false hallucination. You have created the idea that you know. Yes, it hurts to drop it, because then you again become ignorant. And it has taken your whole life to acquire little bits of knowledge from here and there – from the school, the college, the university and the priest and the books – you have been studying and you have been searching and with great effort you have accumulated a little bit of knowledge. And you feel that you may not know the absolute truth but you know enough to move towards truth.\nWhen you come to me you are shocked – because I am telling you again and again that all that you know is just bullshit: simply drop it! Your God is just a fiction, your prayer is just your fear, your love is just your pretension. You are pseudo, root and all; you are just a falsity.\nDrop all this! And become ignorant again, because from that ignorance you can grow. the techniques of Buddhist meditation are nothing but techniques, to help you to get out of the knowledge trip. The whole trip is just garbage.\nAnd remember, knowledge and knowing are not synonymous. Knowing is existential, knowledge is just intellectual. Knowing is out of intelligence, knowledge is just memory – it needs no intelligence. In fact, to avoid intelligence people become addicted to knowledge – it is a cheap thing to become knowledgeable. And then they get excited about useless things.\nSome time, years ago, Art Buchwald told the story in the New York HERALD TRIBUNE of a Hollywood producer whose hobby it was to collect rare books. He loved his avocation so much that he spoke about it constantly, boring his friends who were tired of hearing about it. One day, they decided to play a joke on him. They hired a bit actor and brought him to lunch. When, inevitably, the subject came up, the actor said he’d had an old German Bible around the house for years, but it smelled so bad he finally gave it away to an aunt in Santa Barbara.\n“Who printed it?” the rare-book collector asked.\n“I don’t know...’Guten’ something,” the bit actor said.\nThe producer dropped his fork. “Not Gutenburg?” The actor said he believed that was the name. The producer jumped up from the table. “Let’s go!” he screamed. “We’ll hire a plane!”\n“Go where?” asked the actor.\n“To get the Bible, man! Don’t you realize you have one of the first books ever printed? It’s worth three hundred thousand dollars!”\nThe actor stood up excitedly. Then suddenly he sat down again. “It can’t be worth anything,” he said.\n“Why not?” asked the hysterical producer.\n“Because,” the actor replied, “somebody named Martin Luther scribbled all over it.”\nNow the producer must have gone mad, must have fallen into a swoon! People get excited about trivia, and they think they are doing great work. All your hobbies, all your search, all your so-called spiritual work, can be reduced to a single thing: decoration for the ego. And the ego is the only barrier that is preventing you from knowing that which is.\nThese sutras of Ikkyu are very pragmatic. That is the climate of Buddha. Buddha is a very practical man – that’s why he is non-philosophic. He is a pragmatist, he wants the facts and the truth. And he wants to go directly – he does not want to go here and there and round and round. He wants to beat the bush, not around it.\nThe first sutra:\nON THE SEA OF DEATH AND LIFE, THE DIVER’S BOAT IS FREIGHTED WITH “IS” AND “IS NOT”.\nBUT IF THE BOTTOM IS BROKEN THROUGH, “IS AND”IS NOT” DISAPPEAR.\nTHAT’S THE WAY TO LET PHILOSOPHY DROP. What is philosophy? It is a constant fight between two camps – the camp who believes in “Is” and the camp who believes in “Is not”. One says “God is,” another says “God is not.” One says this, and the other says exactly the opposite. One proposes the thesis and another immediately proposes the antithesis. This game between thesis and antithesis is what is called philosophy.\nThe whole game can be reduced to a simple formula: “Is/Is not.” The theist says “IS”, the atheist says “Is not.” One says the soul exists, the other says there is no soul. One says life has a goal, the other says there is no goal. One says “The soul is immortal,” the other says “Nonsense.” And this has been continuing down the ages, through the ages. And with no conclusion.\nBuddha says: The whole game is futile. For certain basic reasons, the game is futile. Life in its very structure is dialectics, it depends on the polar opposites – thesis, antithesis. Everything automatically turns into its opposite: birth turns into death, day turns into night, love turns into hate, hope turns into despair. And vice-versa: despair again turns into hope, and night again turns into day, and hate again turns into love, and death again turns into birth. The whole wheel consists of the polar opposites.\nBuddha says: To choose between these poles is to be wrong. See the whole of it; don’t say “Is” or “Is not”. Don’t become part of a camp, don’t become part of a school or a doctrine – because all doctrines are partial and each doctrine is trying to prove that this is the whole. This is the trap of philosophy.\nNaturally, when you say “God is light,” how can you believe somebody saying “God is darkness”? Obviously he is denying you; you are at daggers with each other.\nBut Buddha says: Just see – light turns into darkness every day, darkness turns into light every day. So you are not really contradicting each other, you are complementing.\nPolar opposites are not opposites really but complementaries. So there is no way to choose – and if you choose you will be in difficulties...\nYou choose love and then love changes into hate and anger. And then you are in a difficulty, because you were thinking love would remain love for ever. You cannot cling to love for ever; in your very choice you have chosen hate too. Love/hate is one relationship. In fact we should drop ‘love’ and ‘hate’ as two words, we should make one word: ‘lovehate’. We should drop ‘day’ and ‘night’ as two words, we should make one word: ‘daynight’. ‘Birthdeath’. That will be truer, closer to reality – our division is false.\nWhen you are in love you think, “Now I will love for ever and for ever” – and you have forgotten how life functions. By the evening the love is gone and the anger is arising – is BOUND to arise; you cannot do otherwise. In choosing love you have chosen hate too; that is the other aspect of the same coin. But now you are in misery, you think you are betraying. You think, “How is it happening\n? Why is it happening? Why to me? Why can I not love for ever? Why can my lover not love me for ever? In the morning he was so much interested in me, and now he wants to be alone, left alone. What has happened? Where did I go wrong?”\nNobody has been wrong, nothing has happened, all is happening as it should. And soon this anger will go and you will be hugging each other again and love will be there – and you will again forget.\nTo understand life, this is one of the very fundamentals to see, that each thing implies its opposite and each thing automatically turns into its opposite. If you don’t want any enemies then don’t make friends – make a friend, and you have started making an enemy. Only friends can become enemies. If you want never to be unhappy then don’t seek happiness – if you seek happiness you are seeking unhappiness too. Unhappiness comes in the bargain, it is part of the game of happiness, happiness cannot exist without it.\nLife exists amidst death.\nThis is one of the greatest insights of Buddha. So he says: There is no point in choosing. Somebody says God is, and somebody says God is not – they are simply choosing one aspect of reality. God is totality: “Is” plus “Is not”. So if you ask Buddha, “What do you say about God?” he will say, “What can I say? If I say ‘Is’ I am wrong. If I say ‘Is not’ I am wrong. If I say he is both, I puzzle you – then you say that I am confusing you. So it will be better if I keep quiet. I will not say a single thing; I will be silent and I will also teach you silence. When you want to know what God is, become silent. Don’t choose this way or that.”\nPhilosophy is a choice. When you say “I am a Hindu” you have chosen – in that, you are saying “I am not a Mohammedan.” And God is a Hindu, is a Mohammedan, is a Christian, is a Jain, is a communist, and all, and none.\nWhy does everything turn into its opposite? Nobody wants it to be so; still it turns. It is the way of existence, Tao, Dhamma; it is how things move. Just as fire bums, it is fire’s nature, so is this the nature of existence, that it automatically turns into its opposite. Why does it turn into its opposite? Because the opposite is only opposite seen from the surface. Seen from the deep core of reality it is not opposite but complementary.\nJust think of a world where no hate exists – do you think there will be love? That’s what philosophy will say. There are philosophers of love, philosophers of peace, who say if there is no war in the world there will be peace. And it looks so logical, so mathematical, so appealing – that if there is no war there will certainly be peace; when war disappears there will be all peace and peace and peace. That is not true.\nListen to Buddha. Buddha says: War and peace are together. If war disappears, peace will disappear automatically – there will be neither war nor peace. How will you know that this is peace? You will forget all about peace.\nJust think, if death disappears from the world will you be able to know that you are alive? Impossible. How will you know that you are alive? Death is needed to define life. War is needed to define peace, enmity is needed to define friendship, and hate is needed to define love. So they are not separate. They define each other, they depend on each other – if one disappears, the other is bound to disappear.\nPhilosophy chooses. There are pacifist philosophies who think there should be no war, only peace – that then there will be only peace. That’s what Bertrand Russell was saying. It is not possible. Krishna is far closer to truth when he says that sometimes there is peace and sometimes there is war. Both exist together.\nOur minds choose logically; logic never allows the opposite. Existence DEPENDS on the opposite. Hence, logic and existence never meet. And philosophy is a logical endeavour. The more logical you are, the less is the possibility to know what the truth is.\nBuddha says: This is the dilemma, the predicament of human mind – to be or not to be. But both are together; you cannot decide. If you decide to be, you have also decided not to be, and vice-versa. No choice seems to be the right choice; choose, and you always choose something wrong. only choicelessness is right. Don’t choose, let things be as they are. When it is war, let it be. When it is peace, let it be. When it is love, let it be; when it is not love, let it be. You remain aloof, watching, a witness.\nJust see that understanding: you are just a witness, and things turn into their opposites on their own. Peaks are followed by valleys, highs are followed by lows, and so on and so forth. There is nothing you can do. If you don’t choose, the doer disappears, starts evaporating. Then you can only be conscious of whatsoever is the case.\nThis is “breaking through the bottom”. ON THE SEA OF DEATH AND LIFE, THE DIVER’S BOAT IS FREIGHTED\nWITH “IS” AND “IS NOT”.\nBUT IF THE BOTTOM IS BROKEN THROUGH, “IS AND”IS NOT” DISAPPEAR.\nCHOICELESSNESS IS THE WAY to get out of all these clingings. Choicelessness is the way out of this world. Mind always chooses.\nI have heard:\nMulla Nasruddin was walking with his son along a country road behind their donkey, who was contentedly nibbling the grass along the way. A man, seeing Mulla and his son walking and sweating profusely, remarked, “Look how foolish they are, walking instead of riding.”\nHearing this remark, Mulla and his son climbed on the donkey and rode through the next village where they heard an old man exclaim, “They ought to be ashamed, making the poor donkey carry two riders.”\nMulla dismounted and walked while his son rode the donkey to the next village. There, Mulla heard this comment: “Poor old man. That boy ought to be ashamed, making his father walk.”\nThen Mulla got on the donkey, while his son dismounted and walked for some distance.\nFinally, another villager observed, “Look at that old man riding, while his son has to walk. How cruel!”\nMulla rubbed his beard, shook his head, and said to himself, “You cannot please all of the people any of the time.”\nWhat was happening in this story? It is one of the most famous Sufi stories – what was happening? Mulla was doing one thing, people were suggesting the antithesis. And, seeing the point, he chose the antithesis. Then somebody suggested the antithesis of the antithesis, and so on and so forth – he was always choosing and choosing.\nThis is how people are moving; this is the way of the mind. You always choose. You choose one thing, and sooner or later from somewhere the suggestion will come: choose the other – because you become tired of that which you have chosen, and the other is as significant as this. And when you are tired of one thing, naturally you start thinking of the opposite.\nYou have been fasting too much, then naturally you start thinking of food. When you are eating too much you start thinking of fasting. When you have been running after money too much, one day you decide to run from the world, the world of money and all, and go to the Himalayas. When you reach the Himalayas, by the time you reach there and sit in your cave, you have not even settled there and you start thinking of the world and money and all. You become afraid, sitting in the cave, of what will happen to you – tomorrow how are you going to get your food now you have no money at all? And in the night you become afraid, alone in the forest with no protection.\nNow you see the point, what was beautiful in the house: you were protected and there was a shelter and safety. Now, when you were in the house you never thought about the protection and the safety; it was accepted, it was taken for granted. You were thinking of other things – you were thinking that you were almost closed in a prison, you were thinking of the open skies and the sunlit peaks and the beautiful forests, and the silence, the primordial silence of the Himalayas, and the snowcapped peaks and that eternal beauty. You were thinking of these things.\nAnd when you are sitting amidst that eternal beauty you will forget about it. You perceive only that which you don’t have; that which you have disappears from your perception. Perception happens only when something new happens. You see only the new. The mind tends not to see the old – what is the point? you have seen it already. Now for the first time you start thinking of the house and the beauty of it. There was no fear there. Now here there is more and more fear, you cannot sleep at night. Although the primordial silence is there, the silence is too much; it is heavy, you cannot tolerate it. It creates fear in you.\nWhenever you come across primordial silence you start feeling very afraid, because you have lived in the world of language; you have become accustomed to it. Have you not seen this restlessness? When you meet a person in the train, in the bus, a stranger, you start feeling restless, he starts feeling restless – unless you become introduced to each other, unless you bring language in. The silence hurts both. You fidget, he fidgets, and finally somebody has to break the ice. That ice is silence. Somebody has to ask, “Where are you going?” – somebody has to bring language in. Once language comes in, communication happens. Then you are part of a human world.\nHave you not heard the famous Zen story?\nFour persons decided to go into silence for one week. A few hours passed, then one said, “I wonder whether I have put the fire out in my house or left it on.”\nThe other says, “You fool, you have spoken! And we had decided not to speak.” The third said, “What do you think you are doing? You have spoken too!”\nAnd the fourth said, “I am the only one who has not spoken yet.”\nIt is difficult to be silent. Language is in our blood, our bones, our marrow. Man lives in a sea of language.\nDon’t you see it happening continuously? The people who are very very articulate become very important. The man who can use language cleverly becomes a leader, a great leader of men – and all his skill may be just linguistic. A man who is not very efficient at language remains a third-rate man, because this society lives through language.\nIt is said of Josef Stalin that he always used to ask his cronies whenever some new name would bubble up in the talks – somebody, some author, some poet, some philosopher, some thinker – he would always ask the same question: “Is he a genius?” And if the answer was yes, then the genius would disappear within days. He would not be found any more; he would be killed. Why? Why was Sta]in so much afraid of a genius? Because these people are dangerous. ‘Genius’ means one\nwho is very very clever with language – who can write beautifully, who can speak beautifully, who is articulate. These are the dangerous people. They create rebellions, revolutions; they become leaders of men.\nIf the answer was no, that he was not a genius, just a second-rate author or a poet, then there was no problem.\nMan lives through language. And you will only know that your language is so essential to you when you have moved to the Himalayas – never before it. Here, it is taken for granted. Here, sometimes sitting in your room, you feel very good when you are alone – so silent. But that too is because there is so much noise all around; in contrast it is beautiful. If you go to the Himalayas, within a few days you will become frightened, because there is no contrast any more.\nIt is good to be silent for a few hours, because it gives you relaxation from language. But then again you are ready to talk, to communicate.\nPeople living in the world think of the beauties of those who have renounced and gone to the monasteries. And people living in the monasteries simply feel that they have missed this chance to live – life is there outside where people are enjoying, rejoicing, indulging, eating, loving; real life is there. Monks become sad and think constantly of the world. This is one of the basic things to see about the mind.\nBuddha says: Once you choose one thing, sooner or later you will have to choose the opposite. You will become tired of it, you will start forgetting about it, you will not perceive it any more – and you will start thinking of the beauties of the opposite. And each thing that you choose is only a part, it is never the whole. If it is the whole, there is no need to choose. Choice is of the part, can only be of the part. You cannot choose the whole, because then there is no point in choosing.\nIf you say, “I choose life, I choose death” then what you are saying is, “I don’t care a bit – whether it is life or death, it is all the same to me. I don’t choose.”\nChoicelessness brings you to the whole. Choice is always of the part, necessarily so. And then one person goes from one choice to another, becomes a driftwood – from this bank to another bank, from that bank to this bank. This is how you have been moving, down the ages, for so many lives.\nON THE SEA OF DEATH AND LIFE, THE DIVER’S BOAT IS FREIGHTED WITH “IS” AND “IS NOT”.\nBUT IF THE BOTTOM IS BROKEN THROUGH, “IS AND”IS NOT” DISAPPEAR.\nJUMP! exactly into the middle, through the middle. Don’t choose. Remain alert and don’t choose. Let life happen with no choice on your part, as if you are just sitting in a movie: it does not depend\non your choice. The movie is moving, the pictures are coming and going, the story is unfolding; it doesn’t depend on your choice.\nBut even seeing a film you start choosing. You start thinking, “If this man had a little better character, if this man was a little more moral” – you have started choosing. And you know that it doesn’t depend on your choice. It is already there, it is going to happen as it is going to happen, you can just relax and enjoy whatsoever is happening.\nYes – by not choosing, the film will not stop, it will continue. But it will have no more effect on you. You will remain undistracted, undisturbed; you will remain centered.\nThat’s the beauty of choicelessness. Krishnamurti is right when he again and again emphasizes choicelessness. That is also the taste of Zen.\nZen has created many methods to break through the bottom, so that you can jump out of choice, duality, opposites. The koan is one of the most important methods. The master gives a certain puzzle, it is no ordinary puzzle, to the disciple to meditate upon. Its extraordinariness is that it cannot be solved. It has been made with every care so that the mind cannot supply any answer to it; it is unanswerab]e.\nFor example “the sound of one hand clapping”: the disciple is to meditate upon the sound of one hand clapping. Now, there can be no sound, it is logically impossible – two hands will be needed. Sound cannot be there unless two things collide – only then can sound be created. One hand cannot create sound; that is impossible. Now, that has to be meditated upon.\nThe disciple knows it is impossible, the master knows it is impossible. Day in, day out, the disciple will meditate on the sound of one hand. And he knows it is impossible but the master says, “Go on meditating. Because it is impossible, it is important.” He goes on meditating, meditating; he drives himself almost crazy.\nNaturally, if you think about it, you will slowly slowly become crazy. Your mind will say, “What are you doing? There can be NO sound!” But the master says, “Go on meditating, you have to find it out. There is a sound,” the master says, “which is not created by two hands. Go and find it out.”\nSometimes months pass and sometimes years. But one day the mind comes to its ultimate peak. The mind starts really going crazy – it spins and spins, round and round it goes and moves, and it cannot produce any answer. It comes to its ultimate capacity. From that capacity, the breakdown and the breakthrough.\nSuddenly all is silence. The question has disappeared, the questioner has disappeared, the mind is no more there, no thought is there, all is utter silence.\nThat is the sound of one hand clapping.\nThis is satori. This is “breaking through the bottom.” Then there is no “Is” and no “Is not”. Then you cannot say “God is” and you cannot say “God is not”. Then the whole is, then the one is – undivided. This whole is God, or nirvana or Tao.\nTHE MIND CANNOT BECOME THE BUDDHA...\nNow, this is a koan:\nTHE MIND CANNOT BECOME THE BUDDHA; THE BODY CANNOT BECOME THE BUDDHA; ONLY WHAT CANNOT BECOME THE BUDDHA CAN BECOME THE BUDDHA.\nNOW THE WHOLE NONSENSE OF IT! But Zen uses nonsense in a very sensible way. It has sense in its nonsense. Now, you cannot make anything out of this statement:\nTHE MIND CANNOT BECOME THE BUDDHA; THE BODY CANNOT BECOME THE BUDDHA; ONLY WHAT CANNOT BECOME THE BUDDHA CAN BECOME THE BUDDHA.\nThat’s why people like Arthur Koestler think that Zen is all nonsense. On the surface, yes. At the deepest core, the most sensible thing that has ever happened on this earth. It is the sense of nonsense! These are not philosophical statements – that’s where Arthur Koestler goes on missing. These are not philosophical statements, these are devices. These are devices to drive you so crazy that out of the sheer craziness of it the mind comes to a halt.\nHow long can you go on repeating this sutra? THE MIND CANNOT BECOME THE BUDDHA; THE BODY CANNOT BECOME THE BUDDHA; ONLY WHAT CANNOT BECOME THE BUDDHA CAN BECOME THE BUDDHA.\nHow long? This has to be meditated upon, it is a koan. The master will say, “Find out the meaning of it.” Now, there is no meaning; nobody can find out the meaning! But you TRY to find out the meaning – and you will not be able to find it out, but the very effort will lead you to a certain state.\nI have heard, it happened: A woman was getting very fat. She went to the doctor, the doctor gave her a bottle of beautiful red pills and told her, “Within a month, at least fifteen pounds’ weight will disappear. And within a year, slowly slowly, you will become normal.”\nShe was very happy, she went home. She had two daughters, one and seven years old – they liked the bottle and the red pills so much that they swallowed all the pills between themselves. Now the\nwoman was very much afraid. She phoned the doctor, the doctor said, “Don’t be worried. For a few days the girls will go crazy; they will not be able to sleep at all, they will remain wide awake. And they will have great energy and they will remain restless for a few days; they will jump and scream and rush about and run all around the house. But nothing really harmful – within seven days they will cool down. So don’t be worried.”\nBut those seven days were hell. The girls wouldn’t sleep at all; the whole night they would shout and scream and jump. And they had so much energy, the woman could not control them. They drove the woman crazy. In seven days THEY cooled down, but the woman was just completely broken. But one thing happened: she lost fifteen pounds of weight.\nNow, that is a totally different thing – not a logical conclusion, it may not have happened through the pills themselves, but that’s what really happened. And the doctor had said, “In one month you will lose fifteen pounds.” She lost it in one week.\nThis is what a koan is. You will not get to the answer but something else will happen. That is the sense of the nonsense. You will be thinking of the meaning and no meaning will be coming – because there is none, so how can it come?\nArthur Koestler is right that it is a nonsense statement. And yet he has missed the whole point. It is a nonsense statement, but trying to make sense out of it you will drive your mind crazy. You will become so restless, so disturbed, so stirred, that you will reach the climax. You will start boiling at a hundred degrees – and at that point the evaporation happens. That is a by-product.\nSuddenly the whole mind is gone, and all its problems and all its philosophy and all its answers and questions. All, root and all, has simply disappeared. You simply look around and there is no mind! You look out, and it is not there. You look in, and it is not there. You search everywhere, and it is not there: you cannot find yourself.\nAnd this is the moment of satori, when you cannot find yourself. When you cannot find yourself, you have found it. Now the ego is not there, there is great silence.\nTHE MIND CANNOT BECOME THE BUDDHA; THE BODY CANNOT BECOME THE BUDDHA...\nObviously – because the mind is one half and the body is the other half. And both have been believed in. There are many religions which believe in the mind – the majority of religions believe in the mind and are against the body. They all teach anti-body practices. Christianity is anti-body, Jainism is anti-body. They teach you how to destroy your body deliberately, they teach you how to destroy all the energy that the body has, because that is your enemy: if you can destroy the body you will know God or you will know truth or whatsoever it is. They live in the mind, they have chosen the mind.\nThere are religions which have chosen the body – very few, and they are not called religions either. The Charvakas in India: they were as religious as Christians and Jains, but their religion consists of the body. That’s why the majority of religions will call them non-religious, anti-religious. They are\nnot. Their religion is totally different, the polar opposite they believe in the body. They say there is no mind, no soul, that is all nonsense. Just live your body: eat, drink, and be merry. The religion of Epicurus is of the body.\nBut both are wrong according to Ikkyu, according to Buddha, according to me too. Both are wrong – because man is a whole, an organic whole: mind and body are together. In fact man is not mind and body, but mindbody. The body is just the visible part of the mind, and the mind is the invisible part of the body. They are one energy.\nTHE MIND CANNOT BECOME THE BUDDHA...\nTrue, it cannot. Against the body, the mind cannot become the Buddha. THE BODY CANNOT BECOME THE BUDDHA...\nAgainst the mind, the body cannot become the Buddha. If you believe in the first, you will become spiritualists. If you believe in the second, you will become materialists. But in either way you will miss real religion.\nONLY WHAT CANNOT BECOME THE BUDDHA CAN BECOME THE BUDDHA.\nAnd now the strange statement.\nTHE MIND CANNOT BECOME THE BUDDHA; THE BODY CANNOT BECOME THE BUDDHA...\nBoth cannot become Buddha separately, taken apart. But both together CAN become the Buddha. In fact both together are ALREADY the Buddha.\nAS LIGHTNING\nWHICH DISAPPEARS LIKE DEW, WHICH VANISHES LIKE A PHANTOM – THUS THINK OF YOURSELF.\nThis is again another meditation. AS LIGHTNING\nWHICH DISAPPEARS LIKE DEW, WHICH VANISHES LIKE A PHANTOM –\nTHUS THINK OF YOURSELF.\nALL IS MOMENTARY. Only for the moment, like the dew in the morning, will the sun rise, and then it will disappear. Or the lightning in the clouds – you have not even seen it, and it is gone. All is momentary; nothing abides, everything comes and disappears. Not only that – everything disappears and turns into its opposite.\nSeeing this, there is nothing to cling to; thinking this, one becomes unattached. One starts being in a kind of let-go, one allows whatsoever happens. One has no obsession that it should be so, one has no claim on existence. One simply trusts and flows with existence – wherever it takes one and whatsoever is happening or is going to happen. One has no predetermined goal.\nAS LIGHTNING\nWHICH DISAPPEARS LIKE DEW, WHICH VANISHES LIKE A PHANTOM – THUS THINK OF YOURSELF.\nA MIND TO SEARCH ELSEWHERE FOR THE BUDDHA,\nIS THE FOOLISHNESS\nIN THE VERY CENTER OF FOOLISHNESS.\nAnd this is the greatest foolishness, to search for Buddha, because you are it already. Again and again this has to be repeated – this is the greatest statement, the most potential. Some day you may hear it, some day it may strike you, some day it may just penetrate your heart like an arrow – hot. And in that very moment you will be transformed. Hence it has to be repeated again and again.\nA MIND TO SEARCH ELSEWHERE\nFOR THE BUDDHA, IS THE FOOLISHNESS IN THE VERY CENTER OF FOOLISHNESS.\nThe greatest foolishness is one. All other foolishnesses arise out of it, it is the mother of all other foo]ishnesses. What is that? To search for Buddha. You will never find Buddha anywhere, because he is already you. If you search for him you will miss. The seeker is never going to find – the finders are those who stop seeking.\nAgain, there are two parties, two philosophies. Some say “Seek outside.” There are religions which say, “God is there above in heaven, outside you. Worship God: create a temple, make a statue, an image, an ikon. Learn the right prayer and the right form of ritual, and serve God, and you\nwill find him somewhere outside.” This is one kind of religion, which searches outside – Hinduism, Christianity, Mohammedanism.\nThere is another kind of religion that searches within. Jainism: it says, “Look within. God is not outside. Your self is the supreme self, God resides in you. So go in, but still search.”\nA few search outside, a few search inside.\nZen says: Don’t search at all! Searching out, searching in, there is no difference. To the extent that we know all is dream, to that extent we become unattached to whatsoever happens – to things and to the self. The more you become detached towards things and towards the self, you start losing the idea of the inside and the outside. That division is again the same duality – in, out. There is nothing in, nothing out, all is one. Our mistake is to look for truth outside OR inside. The great mistake is to LOOK at all. Then what to do?\nThe Zen formula is simple: non-doing, WU-WEI. Sitting silently doing nothing – neither looking out nor looking in, not looking for anything at all, just being yourself – and in that moment, Buddha is known. Buddha is your very being. ‘Buddha’ in Buddhism means exactly what ‘God’ means in other religions.\nTHE DEW ON THE LOTUS LEAF UNDYED BY ITS COLOUR, JUST AS IT IS,\nIS THE REAL FORM OF BUDDHA.\nAND A GREAT REBELLIOUS STATEMENT, to be remembered always. Somehow, deep inside, the idea persists in you that Buddha is somebody special – that when you become a Buddha you will be somebody extraordinary. That is again the old seeker’s mind which cannot believe in that which is, but always hankers for that which is not.\nListen to this statement:\nTHE DEW ON THE LOTUS LEAF UNDYED BY ITS COLOUR, JUST AS IT IS,\nIS THE REAL FORM OF BUDDHA.\nBe awake! And listen! Just as you are – JUST AS YOU ARE, I repeat – you are the Buddha. Nothing has to be added to you, nothing has to be taken away from you. Just as you are, exactly as you are, in your utter ordinariness, you are Buddha.\nThe day you recognize this you will be surprised – you will start laughing. How ridiculous has been the whole search, and how ridiculous have been your problems!\nListen to these two stories:\nA monk once asked a Zen master, “Does a dog have the Buddha nature?” He replied, “Yes, it does.”\nThe monk then asked, “Do you have the Buddha nature?” He replied, “No, I don’t.”\nThe monk then said, “But I thought everybody has the Buddha nature!”\nThe master replied, “Yes, but I am not everybody! In fact I am nobody – so how can I have the Buddha nature?”\nHe HAS the Buddha nature! This is the way Zen people express themselves, in puzzles. But he has made the point very clear. In your nobodiness, or in your ordinariness... And the ordinariness has to be such that you don’t even claim that you are a Buddha. If you claim, you are not. That’s why he says, “Yes, but I am not everybody. In fact I am nobody – how can I be a Buddha?”\nWhen one knows, one does not claim. Another story:\nA Zen master was worshipping at a statue of the Buddha. A novice came by and asked, “Why do you worship the Buddha? I thought Zen teaches us not to. Do not some Zen masters spit at the Buddha?”\nThe master replied, “Some spit at the Buddha and some worship the Buddha. I prefer the other.”\nBut it is all the same. Life continues as it is. Some worship the Buddha, some spit on the Buddha, life continues as it is.\nThe man of Zen has no choice, only preferences – and make clear to yourself the difference between a choice and a preference. A choice says “I am very serious about it.” A choice says “This way I would like to live, the other way I would not like to live at all. This is the way to live; that way is worthless.”\nA preference simply says “I like this, but if it doesn’t happen then the other is also good.” There is no seriousness involved in it. Naturally, a Zen master also has preferences. When he sleeps he does not sleep on thorns, he sleeps on his bed. This is a preference, not a choice – if he HAS to sleep on the thorns he will sleep there too. If the bed is not avail able and sleep is coming on, he will sleep on the thorns too. But again this is not a choice; just in that circumstance it is the only possible thing to do.\nHe eats food, he does not eat stones – that is a preference, not a choice. Remember, a Zen master also walks and goes through the door, not through the wall. That is just a preference. That’s what this master is saying: “Yes, some spit at the Buddha and some worship the Buddha. I prefer worship.”\nBut he is not serious about it. A Christian cannot be so easy about it – if somebody spits on Christ he will be mad, he will kill the man! He will not be able to tolerate this, although Christianity goes on talking about tolerance and love and forgiving the enemy. But he will not forgive THIS enemy, he will kill this enemy.\nIf you spit on the Buddha and a Zen master is worshipping, he will just look at you and think, “He prefers spitting, I prefer worship.” There is no choice involved, but a great detachment. See the point, it is of immense value. Preference is okay, choice is not good.\nAnd when it is said “Become choiceless” a few foolish people start thinking that they can’t prefer now – because they think preference is choice. They start thinking that now they cannot prefer.\nIn India it has happened: there are mahatmas in India, saints – very well-known, worshipped by thousands – whose whole prestige is because they don’t prefer. If they are eating and you just sit in front of them and piss there, it’s okay. Or they may be just sitting in dirt – it’s okay, because they think this is choicelessness. Because of this idea, India has become so dirty. If mahatmas are doing such great things, then followers, if not THAT great, also follow a little bit – they also should not choose. India has become so poor.\nYou need not make this mistake. If there is a possibility to be rich, prefer being rich! don’t prefer being poor. But remember that this is a preference, not a choice. If riches one day disappear – because all is fleeting, THE DEW ON THE LOTUS LEAF, then it is perfectly okay, then be poor. Don’t choose poverty, don’t choose richness. But preference is perfectly good and sane.\nIf you can be healthy, prefer to be healthy. If you cannot be, then it is okay, then accept your illness. But I am not saying choose illness.\nThat calamity has happened in this country. For at least four or five thousand years, this country has lived in such a nonsensical philosophy: “Don’t choose.” That’s why this country remained poor. “Don’t even prefer.” So whatsoever is, is okay. People have been dying and starving, people are ugly, people are ill, their life is a dog’s life – but they go on. They have lost the energy to live, to change, to transform themselves.\nReligion became very poisonous in India. This should not be repeated! I have lived in poverty, I have lived in richness. And to be frank with you, richness is better. So is health, so are all the good things of life – but this is just a preference.\nPreference simply means you are not very serious about it. If playfully it is possible, good. You are not dead set for it, that if it doesn’t happen you will commit suicide, that if you are not the richest man in the world then you would like not to live at all – that is foolishness.\nZen people don’t choose – they don’t choose the world, they don’t choose renunciation of the world. But they have lived in the world; they prefer. They say, “This seems to be more natural.” They live\nlike ordinary people, just as you live. But they live with an extraordinary intelligence, they live with great awareness.\nAs choice disappears more and more and preference takes its place, you become more and more intelligent, more alert, more conscious. A lucidity, a grace, arises in your being.\nTHE DEW ON THE LOTUS LEAF UNDYED BY ITS COLOUR...\nIkkyu is saying: Be the dew on the lotus leaf. Although from the outside the dew will look coloured by the lotus leaf – if the lotus leaf is green the dewdrop will look green, will look emerald – yet it is not coloured, it remains uncoloured. It is not affected by the lotus leaf; that is only an appearance.\nThe Zen man lives in the world, but uncoloured. He may have a wife, he may have children, but he remains uncoloured:\nTHE DEW ON THE LOTUS LEAF UNDYED BY ITS COLOUR...\nHe moves through the world, uncontaminated, unpolluted by it. The world never enters in him. That’s why he is not worried about getting out of it. He is not interested in going to the Himalayas. Why? For what? He knows the world is not in him, so what is the point of going anywhere else? The person who is escaping from the world is afraid of the world, because when he is in the world the world enters into him and he cannot resist. He is incapable, he is impotent, he is not yet aware enough to be so that the world cannot enter into him. To avoid this, he is escaping to the Himalayas. But how is he going to become more conscious in the Himalayas?\nIf the world cannot make you more conscious, the Himalayas cannot make you, certainly – it is impossible for the Himalayas. The world is a challenge! And intelligence exists only when there is challenge. It is sharpened by challenges – with greater challenges, greater intelligence happens.\nTHE DEW ON THE LOTUS LEAF UNDYED BY ITS COLOUR, JUST AS IT IS,\nIS THE REAL FORM OF BUDDHA.\nThe shopkeeper in the shop and the worker in the factory and the farmer on the field – the dew on the lotus leaf, if it is uncoloured by the leaf, then there is no problem. You can be a farmer or a shopkeeper or a clerk or a mastqer, you can be anybody – that is only the form. Deep inside, remain unattached to whatsoever is happening around you. Preference is okay – don’t choose. And you are Buddha.\nThis very body the Buddha, and this very earth the lotus paradise.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"9738","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/take_it_easy_vol_2/part7/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/take_it_easy_vol_2/>Take It Easy, Vol 2</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">7 Breaking Through the Bottom</h1><div class=post-meta>46 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;9738 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Take_It_Easy_Vol_2/part7.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part6>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

ONLY WHAT CANNOT BECOME THE BUDDHA CAN BECOME THE BUDDHA.</p><p>AS LIGHTNING</p><p><br></p><p>WHICH DISAPPEARS LIKE DEW, WHICH VANISHES LIKE A PHANTOM –</p><p>THUS THINK OF YOURSELF.</p><p><br></p><p>A MIND TO SEARCH ELSEWHERE FOR THE BUDDHA</p><p>IS THE FOOLISHNESS</p><p><br></p><p>IN THE VERY CENTER OF FOOLISHNESS. THE DEW ON THE LOTUS LEAF</p><p>UNDYED BY ITS COLOUR, JUST AS IT IS,</p><p>IS THE REAL FORM OF BUDDHA.</p><p><br></p><p>An elderly woman came into a doctor’s office, exclaiming, “Doctor, my
stomach hurts!” The doctor said, “But madam, I am a doctor of
philosophy.”</p><p>For a moment she forgot the pain, and then seemed puzzled.
“Philosophy? What kind of disease is that?”</p><p><br></p><p>YES, PHILOSOPHY IS A DISEASE, and not an ordinary one either. It is
not a common cold, it is cancer – cancer of the soul. Once a person is
lost in the jungle of philosophy he becomes more and more entangled in
words, concepts, abstractions. And there is no end to it, one can go on
and on for lives together.</p><p><br></p><p>Philosophy is all a mind game; mind perpetuates through it. And the
truth can be known only when you are in a state of no-mind. So the
philosopher never comes to know the truth. Unless philosophy is dropped
utterly, in toto, one cannot know what truth is or what God is.</p><p><br></p><p>Philosophy thinks ABOUT God and hence goes on missing God. It goes on
spinning and weaving theories around and around; it never hits the
target. It moves in circles – it creates one idea about God, and then
that idea creates another idea... and ideas don’t believe in birth
control; they go on reproducing themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>Mind secretes philosophy, creates philosophy, lives through it.
Without philosophy the mind cannot exist for even a single moment. The
mind HAS to be a Hindu or a Mohammedan or a Christian or a communist.
The mind cannot remain for even a single moment in existence if it is
not Hindu, not Mohammedan, not Jain, not Christian. If the mind has no
philosophy to depend on, it dies out of starvation. If there are no
props to support it, if a continuous nourishment is not given to it so
that it can think more and more, the process stops. Philosophy keeps it
going.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddhism is not a philosophy – not at least in Buddha’s being or in
Ikkyu’s being. Those who have realized have realized one thing
absolutely, that truth happens in a non-philosophic state. Truth</p><p>happens in a state of not-knowing, truth happens in innocence. Truth
happens when there are no clouds of thoughts moving in your
consciousness, when the sky is absolutely clear, when there is no
abstraction, when you have no idea what God is or what God is not – when
you don’t believe in God and you don’t believe in no-God, when you are
simply in a state of not-knowing. You don’t claim any knowledge: that
non-claiming consciousness begins to open up. All knowledge burdens and
closes you.</p><p><br></p><p>And Zen is one of the medicines for coming out of the disease called
philosophy. No other school has been able to devise such powerful
medicines for coming out of the world of philosophy as Zen has done.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha did not teach anything to believe in. He was not a teacher in
that sense, because he did not teach. He was, on the contrary, an
anti-teacher – he took away a]l the teachings that people were carrying.
Slowly slowly, he helped his disciples to become utterly nude,
naked.</p><p><br></p><p>Philosophy is a beautiful dress that the mind clings to. Once
philosophy is dropped, mind is ugly. No one would like it, it is
nauseous. Then to drop the mind becomes very easy – in fact to cling to
it becomes impossible. One HAS to drop it; that dropping comes
inevitably and necessarily, of its own accord.</p><p><br></p><p>What exactly is philosophy? It is a pretension of knowing, without
knowing anything at all. It is thinking. Thinking always means the man
is ignorant but is trying to make up something. Whenever you think, that
simply shows you don’t know. Either you know or you don’t. How can you
think? What can you think?</p><p><br></p><p>If I say, “Does God exist or not?” and you say to me, “I will think
over it” what are you going to think over? Either you know or you don’t
– it is just simple like that. What are you going to think about? And
whatsoever you think will be your fabrication, will be a lie. Thinking
consists of lies.</p><p><br></p><p>But one can prove to oneself that those lies are truths; one can
argue for them. In fact truth needs no argument. Truth is self-evident;
only lies need arguments – they are not self-evident, they need
witnesses. A truth is simply truth; unarguably it is there.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why the greatest declarations of truth are absolutely without
any argument. In the Old Testament there is no argument for God. It
simply states: God is. No argument is given, no proofs are contrived.
The Upanishads simply declare; they are declarations, announcements to
the world at large, but with no argumentation behind them. They are not
syllogisms, just poetic assertions. Somebody has known, and he declares.
If you ask him, “What is the proof?” he says, “You can also know.”</p><p><br></p><p>When Vivekananda reached Ramakrishna, he asked this question: “Can
you prove to me that God exists?” And Ramakrishna said, “I cannot prove
that God exists, but I can make you KNOW. Are you ready? This very
moment!”</p><p><br></p><p>Vivekananda was shaken to his very roots. The man was standing there
and asking, “Are you ready? THIS very moment I can show God to you! but
there is no proof.” Vivekananda had not expected this. He had seen many
other philosophers before; he was expecting something like that</p><p>Ramakrishna would give a few proofs, would argue for God, would
destroy the proofs that say God does not exist. He had never come across
a man of real knowledge; this was the first time.</p><p><br></p><p>His throat went dry, he could not utter a single word, he was simply
dumb. For a moment everything stopped. And Ramakrishna touched his chest
with his feet and he fell into deep ecstasy. When he came back he was
trembling. What he had seen was impossible to believe – he had fallen
out of the mind for a moment. That touch of Ramakrishna’s feet: for a
moment he had fallen out of the mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the same happened last night. Sarjano was there – and
Vivekananda must have been in exactly the same situation as Sarjano was
last night – and I told him to hold my feet in his hands for a moment,
and it happened. For a moment he slipped out of the mind.</p><p><br></p><p>The impact of no-mind, if you are ready, can take you into a state of
no-mind. And there is knowing. Knowing is not through the mind, it is
always through the no-mind; it is not through the knower, it is only
when the knower is not.</p><p><br></p><p>And philosophy goes on accepting the knower and goes on trying to
make some toys – theories, doctrines to believe in – so that one can
deceive oneself. And one can go on and on, for ever and for ever.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard:</p><p><br></p><p>An ignoramus managed to get himself invited to a party attended by
world-renowned scientists. Among them was Albert Einstein. The
illiterate guest immediately made a nuisance of himself by dogging the
illustrious physicist’s heels and offering what he thought were very
profound observations.</p><p><br></p><p>“Tell me, Doctor Einstein,” asked the pest, “what, in your opinion,
is the difference between time and eternity?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Sir,” answered Einstein, “if I took the time to explain the
difference, it would take an eternity!”</p><p><br></p><p>In fact Einstein is being very mild, mellow, generous. Even in an
eternity, the difference cannot be explained. Even through an eternity,
if you go on discussing “What is time?” and “What is eternity?” you are
not going to come to any conclusion whatsoever.</p><p><br></p><p>Five thousand years of philosophy, and not a single conclusion in the
hands. Yes, not a single conclusion. No two philosophers agree; they
only agree to disagree. They are constantly arguing against each other.
There is no possibility of agreement, because two lies cannot agree. And
two truths agree so deeply that they become one truth – then they are
not two, the agreement is so total. That’s why it is said that there is
only one truth. There cannot be many, because the agreement is so
infinite and so total and so whole that whenever there are two truths
they immediately jump into one and become one flame.</p><p><br></p><p>All Buddhas agree. But on what? – that cannot be said. If you say it,
it becomes part of philosophy. It remains unsaid, but it can be
experienced.</p><p>Because philosophy is a pretension, it believes in great words. It
believes in phrase-mongering – it creates, fabricates, great words that
people can be impressed by.</p><p><br></p><p>Art Critic I: “I think the neo-plasticism of the abstract design
proves the mystical, metaphysical and non-humanistic approach to the
objective concept of abstraction.”</p><p><br></p><p>Art Critic 2: “Yes, you have a point there! In fact, it’s obvious
even from a casual glance that this painting was created by
paranoiac-critical activity, brought about by spontaneous dynamic
sensations, sometimes made by somnambulistically inclined
campanologists, who create a picture of transcendental non-curvilinear
and curvilinear objects expressing subjective feelings in a cubistic
manner.”</p><p><br></p><p>Art Critic 3: “I fully agree with you both – it’s a rubbishy
painting!”</p><p><br></p><p>Philosophy goes on creating such bombastic words; it is never simple,
it cannot be. It cannot afford to be simple because if it is simple you
will see that it is a lie. It has to be very very roundabout, indirect,
zig-zag – never straight, never to the point. Its whole effort is not to
come to the point: just go on in every direction, but never come home.
And create such bombastic words that you can impress idiots – only
idiots are impressed by those bombastic words.</p><p><br></p><p>Truth is simple. Very simple – so simple that a child can understand
it. In fact, so simple that only a child can understand it. Unless you
become a child again you will not be able to understand it. It is an
experience, not speculation.</p><p><br></p><p>But once you get addicted to great words it is very very difficult to
bring you down to the earth. Those big words give great fulfillment to
your ego. Once a person’s mind starts enjoying great words and great
ideas and complicated theories, it is very difficult for him to descend
to the earth. He flies in the skies, he remains in the high towers of
his mind; he never comes to the fact, to the truth. Because truth is
simple – and what will happen to his philosophy?</p><p><br></p><p>Samantha was a six-year-old who liked to exaggerate almost everything
she saw or did. One day she was looking out of the window when she
called to her mother, “Mummy, Mummy! Come quickly! There’s a lion
walking on the road outside our house!”</p><p><br></p><p>Samantha’s mother looked out of the window but could only see a small
ginger cat.</p><p><br></p><p>“Samantha! You’re lying again!” she scolded. “Go upstairs to your
room immediately and pray to God for forgiveness for being such a
naughty little girl, and beg him to stop you from telling so many
lies.”</p><p><br></p><p>Samantha ran up to her room sobbing. A short time later she came down
to her mother and said, “I’ve prayed to God like you said, Mummy. And he
said that he, too, thought the ginger cat looked rather like a
lion.”</p><p><br></p><p>Once you have started enjoying exaggerations, big words, bombastic
theories, it will be difficult for you. You will try to collect every
kind of proof to convince yourself and others that you are on the right
track. Once the illusion that you know happens to you – and that is the
illusion philosophy</p><p>gives, that you know – then it is very hard to drop that illusion,
because then you become ignorant again.</p><p><br></p><p>That is one of the most difficult things for you in being with me.
When you come, you come with knowledge. And the whole effort here is to
help you drop that knowledge. You come here to acquire a little MORE
knowledge, not to drop that which you have. You come to accumulate a
little more; you come to gather a few more arguments for that which you
already believe. And I am telling you to drop all that you know –
because you don’t really know; it is a false hallucination. You have
created the idea that you know. Yes, it hurts to drop it, because then
you again become ignorant. And it has taken your whole life to acquire
little bits of knowledge from here and there – from the school, the
college, the university and the priest and the books – you have been
studying and you have been searching and with great effort you have
accumulated a little bit of knowledge. And you feel that you may not
know the absolute truth but you know enough to move towards truth.</p><p><br></p><p>When you come to me you are shocked – because I am telling you again
and again that all that you know is just bullshit: simply drop it! Your
God is just a fiction, your prayer is just your fear, your love is just
your pretension. You are pseudo, root and all; you are just a
falsity.</p><p><br></p><p>Drop all this! And become ignorant again, because from that ignorance
you can grow. the techniques of Buddhist meditation are nothing but
techniques, to help you to get out of the knowledge trip. The whole trip
is just garbage.</p><p><br></p><p>And remember, knowledge and knowing are not synonymous. Knowing is
existential, knowledge is just intellectual. Knowing is out of
intelligence, knowledge is just memory – it needs no intelligence. In
fact, to avoid intelligence people become addicted to knowledge – it is
a cheap thing to become knowledgeable. And then they get excited about
useless things.</p><p><br></p><p>Some time, years ago, Art Buchwald told the story in the New York
HERALD TRIBUNE of a Hollywood producer whose hobby it was to collect
rare books. He loved his avocation so much that he spoke about it
constantly, boring his friends who were tired of hearing about it. One
day, they decided to play a joke on him. They hired a bit actor and
brought him to lunch. When, inevitably, the subject came up, the actor
said he’d had an old German Bible around the house for years, but it
smelled so bad he finally gave it away to an aunt in Santa Barbara.</p><p><br></p><p>“Who printed it?” the rare-book collector asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“I don’t know...’Guten’ something,” the bit actor said.</p><p><br></p><p>The producer dropped his fork. “Not Gutenburg?” The actor said he
believed that was the name. The producer jumped up from the table.
“Let’s go!” he screamed. “We’ll hire a plane!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Go where?” asked the actor.</p><p><br></p><p>“To get the Bible, man! Don’t you realize you have one of the first
books ever printed? It’s worth three hundred thousand dollars!”</p><p><br></p><p>The actor stood up excitedly. Then suddenly he sat down again. “It
can’t be worth anything,” he said.</p><p>“Why not?” asked the hysterical producer.</p><p><br></p><p>“Because,” the actor replied, “somebody named Martin Luther scribbled
all over it.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now the producer must have gone mad, must have fallen into a swoon!
People get excited about trivia, and they think they are doing great
work. All your hobbies, all your search, all your so-called spiritual
work, can be reduced to a single thing: decoration for the ego. And the
ego is the only barrier that is preventing you from knowing that which
is.</p><p><br></p><p>These sutras of Ikkyu are very pragmatic. That is the climate of
Buddha. Buddha is a very practical man – that’s why he is
non-philosophic. He is a pragmatist, he wants the facts and the truth.
And he wants to go directly – he does not want to go here and there and
round and round. He wants to beat the bush, not around it.</p><p><br></p><p>The first sutra:</p><p><br></p><p>ON THE SEA OF DEATH AND LIFE, THE DIVER’S BOAT IS FREIGHTED WITH “IS”
AND “IS NOT”.</p><p>BUT IF THE BOTTOM IS BROKEN THROUGH, “IS AND”IS NOT” DISAPPEAR.</p><p>THAT’S THE WAY TO LET PHILOSOPHY DROP. What is philosophy? It is a
constant fight between two camps – the camp who believes in “Is” and the
camp who believes in “Is not”. One says “God is,” another says “God is
not.” One says this, and the other says exactly the opposite. One
proposes the thesis and another immediately proposes the antithesis.
This game between thesis and antithesis is what is called
philosophy.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole game can be reduced to a simple formula: “Is/Is not.” The
theist says “IS”, the atheist says “Is not.” One says the soul exists,
the other says there is no soul. One says life has a goal, the other
says there is no goal. One says “The soul is immortal,” the other says
“Nonsense.” And this has been continuing down the ages, through the
ages. And with no conclusion.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha says: The whole game is futile. For certain basic reasons, the
game is futile. Life in its very structure is dialectics, it depends on
the polar opposites – thesis, antithesis. Everything automatically turns
into its opposite: birth turns into death, day turns into night, love
turns into hate, hope turns into despair. And vice-versa: despair again
turns into hope, and night again turns into day, and hate again turns
into love, and death again turns into birth. The whole wheel consists of
the polar opposites.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha says: To choose between these poles is to be wrong. See the
whole of it; don’t say “Is” or “Is not”. Don’t become part of a camp,
don’t become part of a school or a doctrine – because all doctrines are
partial and each doctrine is trying to prove that this is the whole.
This is the trap of philosophy.</p><p>Naturally, when you say “God is light,” how can you believe somebody
saying “God is darkness”? Obviously he is denying you; you are at
daggers with each other.</p><p><br></p><p>But Buddha says: Just see – light turns into darkness every day,
darkness turns into light every day. So you are not really contradicting
each other, you are complementing.</p><p><br></p><p>Polar opposites are not opposites really but complementaries. So
there is no way to choose – and if you choose you will be in
difficulties...</p><p><br></p><p>You choose love and then love changes into hate and anger. And then
you are in a difficulty, because you were thinking love would remain
love for ever. You cannot cling to love for ever; in your very choice
you have chosen hate too. Love/hate is one relationship. In fact we
should drop ‘love’ and ‘hate’ as two words, we should make one word:
‘lovehate’. We should drop ‘day’ and ‘night’ as two words, we should
make one word: ‘daynight’. ‘Birthdeath’. That will be truer, closer to
reality – our division is false.</p><p><br></p><p>When you are in love you think, “Now I will love for ever and for
ever” – and you have forgotten how life functions. By the evening the
love is gone and the anger is arising – is BOUND to arise; you cannot do
otherwise. In choosing love you have chosen hate too; that is the other
aspect of the same coin. But now you are in misery, you think you are
betraying. You think, “How is it happening</p><p>? Why is it happening? Why to me? Why can I not love for ever? Why
can my lover not love me for ever? In the morning he was so much
interested in me, and now he wants to be alone, left alone. What has
happened? Where did I go wrong?”</p><p><br></p><p>Nobody has been wrong, nothing has happened, all is happening as it
should. And soon this anger will go and you will be hugging each other
again and love will be there – and you will again forget.</p><p><br></p><p>To understand life, this is one of the very fundamentals to see, that
each thing implies its opposite and each thing automatically turns into
its opposite. If you don’t want any enemies then don’t make friends –
make a friend, and you have started making an enemy. Only friends can
become enemies. If you want never to be unhappy then don’t seek
happiness – if you seek happiness you are seeking unhappiness too.
Unhappiness comes in the bargain, it is part of the game of happiness,
happiness cannot exist without it.</p><p><br></p><p>Life exists amidst death.</p><p><br></p><p>This is one of the greatest insights of Buddha. So he says: There is
no point in choosing. Somebody says God is, and somebody says God is not
– they are simply choosing one aspect of reality. God is totality: “Is”
plus “Is not”. So if you ask Buddha, “What do you say about God?” he
will say, “What can I say? If I say ‘Is’ I am wrong. If I say ‘Is not’ I
am wrong. If I say he is both, I puzzle you – then you say that I am
confusing you. So it will be better if I keep quiet. I will not say a
single thing; I will be silent and I will also teach you silence. When
you want to know what God is, become silent. Don’t choose this way or
that.”</p><p><br></p><p>Philosophy is a choice. When you say “I am a Hindu” you have chosen –
in that, you are saying “I am not a Mohammedan.” And God is a Hindu, is
a Mohammedan, is a Christian, is a Jain, is a communist, and all, and
none.</p><p>Why does everything turn into its opposite? Nobody wants it to be so;
still it turns. It is the way of existence, Tao, Dhamma; it is how
things move. Just as fire bums, it is fire’s nature, so is this the
nature of existence, that it automatically turns into its opposite. Why
does it turn into its opposite? Because the opposite is only opposite
seen from the surface. Seen from the deep core of reality it is not
opposite but complementary.</p><p><br></p><p>Just think of a world where no hate exists – do you think there will
be love? That’s what philosophy will say. There are philosophers of
love, philosophers of peace, who say if there is no war in the world
there will be peace. And it looks so logical, so mathematical, so
appealing – that if there is no war there will certainly be peace; when
war disappears there will be all peace and peace and peace. That is not
true.</p><p><br></p><p>Listen to Buddha. Buddha says: War and peace are together. If war
disappears, peace will disappear automatically – there will be neither
war nor peace. How will you know that this is peace? You will forget all
about peace.</p><p><br></p><p>Just think, if death disappears from the world will you be able to
know that you are alive? Impossible. How will you know that you are
alive? Death is needed to define life. War is needed to define peace,
enmity is needed to define friendship, and hate is needed to define
love. So they are not separate. They define each other, they depend on
each other – if one disappears, the other is bound to disappear.</p><p><br></p><p>Philosophy chooses. There are pacifist philosophies who think there
should be no war, only peace – that then there will be only peace.
That’s what Bertrand Russell was saying. It is not possible. Krishna is
far closer to truth when he says that sometimes there is peace and
sometimes there is war. Both exist together.</p><p><br></p><p>Our minds choose logically; logic never allows the opposite.
Existence DEPENDS on the opposite. Hence, logic and existence never
meet. And philosophy is a logical endeavour. The more logical you are,
the less is the possibility to know what the truth is.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha says: This is the dilemma, the predicament of human mind – to
be or not to be. But both are together; you cannot decide. If you decide
to be, you have also decided not to be, and vice-versa. No choice seems
to be the right choice; choose, and you always choose something wrong.
only choicelessness is right. Don’t choose, let things be as they are.
When it is war, let it be. When it is peace, let it be. When it is love,
let it be; when it is not love, let it be. You remain aloof, watching, a
witness.</p><p><br></p><p>Just see that understanding: you are just a witness, and things turn
into their opposites on their own. Peaks are followed by valleys, highs
are followed by lows, and so on and so forth. There is nothing you can
do. If you don’t choose, the doer disappears, starts evaporating. Then
you can only be conscious of whatsoever is the case.</p><p>This is “breaking through the bottom”. ON THE SEA OF DEATH AND LIFE,
THE DIVER’S BOAT IS FREIGHTED</p><p>WITH “IS” AND “IS NOT”.</p><p><br></p><p>BUT IF THE BOTTOM IS BROKEN THROUGH, “IS AND”IS NOT” DISAPPEAR.</p><p>CHOICELESSNESS IS THE WAY to get out of all these clingings.
Choicelessness is the way out of this world. Mind always chooses.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard:</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla Nasruddin was walking with his son along a country road behind
their donkey, who was contentedly nibbling the grass along the way. A
man, seeing Mulla and his son walking and sweating profusely, remarked,
“Look how foolish they are, walking instead of riding.”</p><p><br></p><p>Hearing this remark, Mulla and his son climbed on the donkey and rode
through the next village where they heard an old man exclaim, “They
ought to be ashamed, making the poor donkey carry two riders.”</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla dismounted and walked while his son rode the donkey to the next
village. There, Mulla heard this comment: “Poor old man. That boy ought
to be ashamed, making his father walk.”</p><p><br></p><p>Then Mulla got on the donkey, while his son dismounted and walked for
some distance.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, another villager observed, “Look at that old man riding,
while his son has to walk. How cruel!”</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla rubbed his beard, shook his head, and said to himself, “You
cannot please all of the people any of the time.”</p><p><br></p><p>What was happening in this story? It is one of the most famous Sufi
stories – what was happening? Mulla was doing one thing, people were
suggesting the antithesis. And, seeing the point, he chose the
antithesis. Then somebody suggested the antithesis of the antithesis,
and so on and so forth – he was always choosing and choosing.</p><p><br></p><p>This is how people are moving; this is the way of the mind. You
always choose. You choose one thing, and sooner or later from somewhere
the suggestion will come: choose the other – because you become tired of
that which you have chosen, and the other is as significant as this. And
when you are tired of one thing, naturally you start thinking of the
opposite.</p><p><br></p><p>You have been fasting too much, then naturally you start thinking of
food. When you are eating too much you start thinking of fasting. When
you have been running after money too much, one day you decide to run
from the world, the world of money and all, and go to the Himalayas.
When you reach the Himalayas, by the time you reach there and sit in
your cave, you have not even settled there and you start thinking of the
world and money and all. You become afraid, sitting in the cave, of what
will happen to you – tomorrow how are you going to get your food now you
have no money at all? And in the night you become afraid, alone in the
forest with no protection.</p><p>Now you see the point, what was beautiful in the house: you were
protected and there was a shelter and safety. Now, when you were in the
house you never thought about the protection and the safety; it was
accepted, it was taken for granted. You were thinking of other things –
you were thinking that you were almost closed in a prison, you were
thinking of the open skies and the sunlit peaks and the beautiful
forests, and the silence, the primordial silence of the Himalayas, and
the snowcapped peaks and that eternal beauty. You were thinking of these
things.</p><p><br></p><p>And when you are sitting amidst that eternal beauty you will forget
about it. You perceive only that which you don’t have; that which you
have disappears from your perception. Perception happens only when
something new happens. You see only the new. The mind tends not to see
the old – what is the point? you have seen it already. Now for the first
time you start thinking of the house and the beauty of it. There was no
fear there. Now here there is more and more fear, you cannot sleep at
night. Although the primordial silence is there, the silence is too
much; it is heavy, you cannot tolerate it. It creates fear in you.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever you come across primordial silence you start feeling very
afraid, because you have lived in the world of language; you have become
accustomed to it. Have you not seen this restlessness? When you meet a
person in the train, in the bus, a stranger, you start feeling restless,
he starts feeling restless – unless you become introduced to each other,
unless you bring language in. The silence hurts both. You fidget, he
fidgets, and finally somebody has to break the ice. That ice is silence.
Somebody has to ask, “Where are you going?” – somebody has to bring
language in. Once language comes in, communication happens. Then you are
part of a human world.</p><p><br></p><p>Have you not heard the famous Zen story?</p><p><br></p><p>Four persons decided to go into silence for one week. A few hours
passed, then one said, “I wonder whether I have put the fire out in my
house or left it on.”</p><p><br></p><p>The other says, “You fool, you have spoken! And we had decided not to
speak.” The third said, “What do you think you are doing? You have
spoken too!”</p><p>And the fourth said, “I am the only one who has not spoken yet.”</p><p><br></p><p>It is difficult to be silent. Language is in our blood, our bones,
our marrow. Man lives in a sea of language.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t you see it happening continuously? The people who are very very
articulate become very important. The man who can use language cleverly
becomes a leader, a great leader of men – and all his skill may be just
linguistic. A man who is not very efficient at language remains a
third-rate man, because this society lives through language.</p><p><br></p><p>It is said of Josef Stalin that he always used to ask his cronies
whenever some new name would bubble up in the talks – somebody, some
author, some poet, some philosopher, some thinker – he would always ask
the same question: “Is he a genius?” And if the answer was yes, then the
genius would disappear within days. He would not be found any more; he
would be killed. Why? Why was Sta]in so much afraid of a genius? Because
these people are dangerous. ‘Genius’ means one</p><p>who is very very clever with language – who can write beautifully,
who can speak beautifully, who is articulate. These are the dangerous
people. They create rebellions, revolutions; they become leaders of
men.</p><p><br></p><p>If the answer was no, that he was not a genius, just a second-rate
author or a poet, then there was no problem.</p><p><br></p><p>Man lives through language. And you will only know that your language
is so essential to you when you have moved to the Himalayas – never
before it. Here, it is taken for granted. Here, sometimes sitting in
your room, you feel very good when you are alone – so silent. But that
too is because there is so much noise all around; in contrast it is
beautiful. If you go to the Himalayas, within a few days you will become
frightened, because there is no contrast any more.</p><p><br></p><p>It is good to be silent for a few hours, because it gives you
relaxation from language. But then again you are ready to talk, to
communicate.</p><p><br></p><p>People living in the world think of the beauties of those who have
renounced and gone to the monasteries. And people living in the
monasteries simply feel that they have missed this chance to live – life
is there outside where people are enjoying, rejoicing, indulging,
eating, loving; real life is there. Monks become sad and think
constantly of the world. This is one of the basic things to see about
the mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha says: Once you choose one thing, sooner or later you will have
to choose the opposite. You will become tired of it, you will start
forgetting about it, you will not perceive it any more – and you will
start thinking of the beauties of the opposite. And each thing that you
choose is only a part, it is never the whole. If it is the whole, there
is no need to choose. Choice is of the part, can only be of the part.
You cannot choose the whole, because then there is no point in
choosing.</p><p><br></p><p>If you say, “I choose life, I choose death” then what you are saying
is, “I don’t care a bit – whether it is life or death, it is all the
same to me. I don’t choose.”</p><p><br></p><p>Choicelessness brings you to the whole. Choice is always of the part,
necessarily so. And then one person goes from one choice to another,
becomes a driftwood – from this bank to another bank, from that bank to
this bank. This is how you have been moving, down the ages, for so many
lives.</p><p><br></p><p>ON THE SEA OF DEATH AND LIFE, THE DIVER’S BOAT IS FREIGHTED WITH “IS”
AND “IS NOT”.</p><p>BUT IF THE BOTTOM IS BROKEN THROUGH, “IS AND”IS NOT” DISAPPEAR.</p><p>JUMP! exactly into the middle, through the middle. Don’t choose.
Remain alert and don’t choose. Let life happen with no choice on your
part, as if you are just sitting in a movie: it does not depend</p><p>on your choice. The movie is moving, the pictures are coming and
going, the story is unfolding; it doesn’t depend on your choice.</p><p><br></p><p>But even seeing a film you start choosing. You start thinking, “If
this man had a little better character, if this man was a little more
moral” – you have started choosing. And you know that it doesn’t depend
on your choice. It is already there, it is going to happen as it is
going to happen, you can just relax and enjoy whatsoever is
happening.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes – by not choosing, the film will not stop, it will continue. But
it will have no more effect on you. You will remain undistracted,
undisturbed; you will remain centered.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s the beauty of choicelessness. Krishnamurti is right when he
again and again emphasizes choicelessness. That is also the taste of
Zen.</p><p><br></p><p>Zen has created many methods to break through the bottom, so that you
can jump out of choice, duality, opposites. The koan is one of the most
important methods. The master gives a certain puzzle, it is no ordinary
puzzle, to the disciple to meditate upon. Its extraordinariness is that
it cannot be solved. It has been made with every care so that the mind
cannot supply any answer to it; it is unanswerab]e.</p><p><br></p><p>For example “the sound of one hand clapping”: the disciple is to
meditate upon the sound of one hand clapping. Now, there can be no
sound, it is logically impossible – two hands will be needed. Sound
cannot be there unless two things collide – only then can sound be
created. One hand cannot create sound; that is impossible. Now, that has
to be meditated upon.</p><p><br></p><p>The disciple knows it is impossible, the master knows it is
impossible. Day in, day out, the disciple will meditate on the sound of
one hand. And he knows it is impossible but the master says, “Go on
meditating. Because it is impossible, it is important.” He goes on
meditating, meditating; he drives himself almost crazy.</p><p><br></p><p>Naturally, if you think about it, you will slowly slowly become
crazy. Your mind will say, “What are you doing? There can be NO sound!”
But the master says, “Go on meditating, you have to find it out. There
is a sound,” the master says, “which is not created by two hands. Go and
find it out.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sometimes months pass and sometimes years. But one day the mind comes
to its ultimate peak. The mind starts really going crazy – it spins and
spins, round and round it goes and moves, and it cannot produce any
answer. It comes to its ultimate capacity. From that capacity, the
breakdown and the breakthrough.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly all is silence. The question has disappeared, the questioner
has disappeared, the mind is no more there, no thought is there, all is
utter silence.</p><p><br></p><p>That is the sound of one hand clapping.</p><p><br></p><p>This is satori. This is “breaking through the bottom.” Then there is
no “Is” and no “Is not”. Then you cannot say “God is” and you cannot say
“God is not”. Then the whole is, then the one is – undivided. This whole
is God, or nirvana or Tao.</p><p>THE MIND CANNOT BECOME THE BUDDHA...</p><p><br></p><p>Now, this is a koan:</p><p><br></p><p>THE MIND CANNOT BECOME THE BUDDHA; THE BODY CANNOT BECOME THE BUDDHA;
ONLY WHAT CANNOT BECOME THE BUDDHA CAN BECOME THE BUDDHA.</p><p>NOW THE WHOLE NONSENSE OF IT! But Zen uses nonsense in a very
sensible way. It has sense in its nonsense. Now, you cannot make
anything out of this statement:</p><p><br></p><p>THE MIND CANNOT BECOME THE BUDDHA; THE BODY CANNOT BECOME THE BUDDHA;
ONLY WHAT CANNOT BECOME THE BUDDHA CAN BECOME THE BUDDHA.</p><p>That’s why people like Arthur Koestler think that Zen is all
nonsense. On the surface, yes. At the deepest core, the most sensible
thing that has ever happened on this earth. It is the sense of nonsense!
These are not philosophical statements – that’s where Arthur Koestler
goes on missing. These are not philosophical statements, these are
devices. These are devices to drive you so crazy that out of the sheer
craziness of it the mind comes to a halt.</p><p><br></p><p>How long can you go on repeating this sutra? THE MIND CANNOT BECOME
THE BUDDHA; THE BODY CANNOT BECOME THE BUDDHA; ONLY WHAT CANNOT BECOME
THE BUDDHA CAN BECOME THE BUDDHA.</p><p>How long? This has to be meditated upon, it is a koan. The master
will say, “Find out the meaning of it.” Now, there is no meaning; nobody
can find out the meaning! But you TRY to find out the meaning – and you
will not be able to find it out, but the very effort will lead you to a
certain state.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard, it happened: A woman was getting very fat. She went to
the doctor, the doctor gave her a bottle of beautiful red pills and told
her, “Within a month, at least fifteen pounds’ weight will disappear.
And within a year, slowly slowly, you will become normal.”</p><p><br></p><p>She was very happy, she went home. She had two daughters, one and
seven years old – they liked the bottle and the red pills so much that
they swallowed all the pills between themselves. Now the</p><p>woman was very much afraid. She phoned the doctor, the doctor said,
“Don’t be worried. For a few days the girls will go crazy; they will not
be able to sleep at all, they will remain wide awake. And they will have
great energy and they will remain restless for a few days; they will
jump and scream and rush about and run all around the house. But nothing
really harmful – within seven days they will cool down. So don’t be
worried.”</p><p><br></p><p>But those seven days were hell. The girls wouldn’t sleep at all; the
whole night they would shout and scream and jump. And they had so much
energy, the woman could not control them. They drove the woman crazy. In
seven days THEY cooled down, but the woman was just completely broken.
But one thing happened: she lost fifteen pounds of weight.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, that is a totally different thing – not a logical conclusion, it
may not have happened through the pills themselves, but that’s what
really happened. And the doctor had said, “In one month you will lose
fifteen pounds.” She lost it in one week.</p><p><br></p><p>This is what a koan is. You will not get to the answer but something
else will happen. That is the sense of the nonsense. You will be
thinking of the meaning and no meaning will be coming – because there is
none, so how can it come?</p><p><br></p><p>Arthur Koestler is right that it is a nonsense statement. And yet he
has missed the whole point. It is a nonsense statement, but trying to
make sense out of it you will drive your mind crazy. You will become so
restless, so disturbed, so stirred, that you will reach the climax. You
will start boiling at a hundred degrees – and at that point the
evaporation happens. That is a by-product.</p><p><br></p><p>Suddenly the whole mind is gone, and all its problems and all its
philosophy and all its answers and questions. All, root and all, has
simply disappeared. You simply look around and there is no mind! You
look out, and it is not there. You look in, and it is not there. You
search everywhere, and it is not there: you cannot find yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is the moment of satori, when you cannot find yourself. When
you cannot find yourself, you have found it. Now the ego is not there,
there is great silence.</p><p><br></p><p>THE MIND CANNOT BECOME THE BUDDHA; THE BODY CANNOT BECOME THE
BUDDHA...</p><p>Obviously – because the mind is one half and the body is the other
half. And both have been believed in. There are many religions which
believe in the mind – the majority of religions believe in the mind and
are against the body. They all teach anti-body practices. Christianity
is anti-body, Jainism is anti-body. They teach you how to destroy your
body deliberately, they teach you how to destroy all the energy that the
body has, because that is your enemy: if you can destroy the body you
will know God or you will know truth or whatsoever it is. They live in
the mind, they have chosen the mind.</p><p><br></p><p>There are religions which have chosen the body – very few, and they
are not called religions either. The Charvakas in India: they were as
religious as Christians and Jains, but their religion consists of the
body. That’s why the majority of religions will call them non-religious,
anti-religious. They are</p><p>not. Their religion is totally different, the polar opposite they
believe in the body. They say there is no mind, no soul, that is all
nonsense. Just live your body: eat, drink, and be merry. The religion of
Epicurus is of the body.</p><p><br></p><p>But both are wrong according to Ikkyu, according to Buddha, according
to me too. Both are wrong – because man is a whole, an organic whole:
mind and body are together. In fact man is not mind and body, but
mindbody. The body is just the visible part of the mind, and the mind is
the invisible part of the body. They are one energy.</p><p><br></p><p>THE MIND CANNOT BECOME THE BUDDHA...</p><p><br></p><p>True, it cannot. Against the body, the mind cannot become the Buddha.
THE BODY CANNOT BECOME THE BUDDHA...</p><p>Against the mind, the body cannot become the Buddha. If you believe
in the first, you will become spiritualists. If you believe in the
second, you will become materialists. But in either way you will miss
real religion.</p><p><br></p><p>ONLY WHAT CANNOT BECOME THE BUDDHA CAN BECOME THE BUDDHA.</p><p>And now the strange statement.</p><p><br></p><p>THE MIND CANNOT BECOME THE BUDDHA; THE BODY CANNOT BECOME THE
BUDDHA...</p><p>Both cannot become Buddha separately, taken apart. But both together
CAN become the Buddha. In fact both together are ALREADY the Buddha.</p><p><br></p><p>AS LIGHTNING</p><p><br></p><p>WHICH DISAPPEARS LIKE DEW, WHICH VANISHES LIKE A PHANTOM – THUS THINK
OF YOURSELF.</p><p>This is again another meditation. AS LIGHTNING</p><p>WHICH DISAPPEARS LIKE DEW, WHICH VANISHES LIKE A PHANTOM –</p><p>THUS THINK OF YOURSELF.</p><p><br></p><p>ALL IS MOMENTARY. Only for the moment, like the dew in the morning,
will the sun rise, and then it will disappear. Or the lightning in the
clouds – you have not even seen it, and it is gone. All is momentary;
nothing abides, everything comes and disappears. Not only that –
everything disappears and turns into its opposite.</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing this, there is nothing to cling to; thinking this, one becomes
unattached. One starts being in a kind of let-go, one allows whatsoever
happens. One has no obsession that it should be so, one has no claim on
existence. One simply trusts and flows with existence – wherever it
takes one and whatsoever is happening or is going to happen. One has no
predetermined goal.</p><p><br></p><p>AS LIGHTNING</p><p><br></p><p>WHICH DISAPPEARS LIKE DEW, WHICH VANISHES LIKE A PHANTOM – THUS THINK
OF YOURSELF.</p><p>A MIND TO SEARCH ELSEWHERE FOR THE BUDDHA,</p><p>IS THE FOOLISHNESS</p><p><br></p><p>IN THE VERY CENTER OF FOOLISHNESS.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is the greatest foolishness, to search for Buddha, because
you are it already. Again and again this has to be repeated – this is
the greatest statement, the most potential. Some day you may hear it,
some day it may strike you, some day it may just penetrate your heart
like an arrow – hot. And in that very moment you will be transformed.
Hence it has to be repeated again and again.</p><p><br></p><p>A MIND TO SEARCH ELSEWHERE</p><p><br></p><p>FOR THE BUDDHA, IS THE FOOLISHNESS IN THE VERY CENTER OF
FOOLISHNESS.</p><p>The greatest foolishness is one. All other foolishnesses arise out of
it, it is the mother of all other foo]ishnesses. What is that? To search
for Buddha. You will never find Buddha anywhere, because he is already
you. If you search for him you will miss. The seeker is never going to
find – the finders are those who stop seeking.</p><p><br></p><p>Again, there are two parties, two philosophies. Some say “Seek
outside.” There are religions which say, “God is there above in heaven,
outside you. Worship God: create a temple, make a statue, an image, an
ikon. Learn the right prayer and the right form of ritual, and serve
God, and you</p><p>will find him somewhere outside.” This is one kind of religion, which
searches outside – Hinduism, Christianity, Mohammedanism.</p><p><br></p><p>There is another kind of religion that searches within. Jainism: it
says, “Look within. God is not outside. Your self is the supreme self,
God resides in you. So go in, but still search.”</p><p><br></p><p>A few search outside, a few search inside.</p><p><br></p><p>Zen says: Don’t search at all! Searching out, searching in, there is
no difference. To the extent that we know all is dream, to that extent
we become unattached to whatsoever happens – to things and to the self.
The more you become detached towards things and towards the self, you
start losing the idea of the inside and the outside. That division is
again the same duality – in, out. There is nothing in, nothing out, all
is one. Our mistake is to look for truth outside OR inside. The great
mistake is to LOOK at all. Then what to do?</p><p><br></p><p>The Zen formula is simple: non-doing, WU-WEI. Sitting silently doing
nothing – neither looking out nor looking in, not looking for anything
at all, just being yourself – and in that moment, Buddha is known.
Buddha is your very being. ‘Buddha’ in Buddhism means exactly what ‘God’
means in other religions.</p><p><br></p><p>THE DEW ON THE LOTUS LEAF UNDYED BY ITS COLOUR, JUST AS IT IS,</p><p>IS THE REAL FORM OF BUDDHA.</p><p><br></p><p>AND A GREAT REBELLIOUS STATEMENT, to be remembered always. Somehow,
deep inside, the idea persists in you that Buddha is somebody special –
that when you become a Buddha you will be somebody extraordinary. That
is again the old seeker’s mind which cannot believe in that which is,
but always hankers for that which is not.</p><p><br></p><p>Listen to this statement:</p><p><br></p><p>THE DEW ON THE LOTUS LEAF UNDYED BY ITS COLOUR, JUST AS IT IS,</p><p>IS THE REAL FORM OF BUDDHA.</p><p><br></p><p>Be awake! And listen! Just as you are – JUST AS YOU ARE, I repeat –
you are the Buddha. Nothing has to be added to you, nothing has to be
taken away from you. Just as you are, exactly as you are, in your utter
ordinariness, you are Buddha.</p><p>The day you recognize this you will be surprised – you will start
laughing. How ridiculous has been the whole search, and how ridiculous
have been your problems!</p><p><br></p><p>Listen to these two stories:</p><p><br></p><p>A monk once asked a Zen master, “Does a dog have the Buddha nature?”
He replied, “Yes, it does.”</p><p>The monk then asked, “Do you have the Buddha nature?” He replied,
“No, I don’t.”</p><p>The monk then said, “But I thought everybody has the Buddha
nature!”</p><p><br></p><p>The master replied, “Yes, but I am not everybody! In fact I am nobody
– so how can I have the Buddha nature?”</p><p><br></p><p>He HAS the Buddha nature! This is the way Zen people express
themselves, in puzzles. But he has made the point very clear. In your
nobodiness, or in your ordinariness... And the ordinariness has to be
such that you don’t even claim that you are a Buddha. If you claim, you
are not. That’s why he says, “Yes, but I am not everybody. In fact I am
nobody – how can I be a Buddha?”</p><p><br></p><p>When one knows, one does not claim. Another story:</p><p>A Zen master was worshipping at a statue of the Buddha. A novice came
by and asked, “Why do you worship the Buddha? I thought Zen teaches us
not to. Do not some Zen masters spit at the Buddha?”</p><p><br></p><p>The master replied, “Some spit at the Buddha and some worship the
Buddha. I prefer the other.”</p><p><br></p><p>But it is all the same. Life continues as it is. Some worship the
Buddha, some spit on the Buddha, life continues as it is.</p><p><br></p><p>The man of Zen has no choice, only preferences – and make clear to
yourself the difference between a choice and a preference. A choice says
“I am very serious about it.” A choice says “This way I would like to
live, the other way I would not like to live at all. This is the way to
live; that way is worthless.”</p><p><br></p><p>A preference simply says “I like this, but if it doesn’t happen then
the other is also good.” There is no seriousness involved in it.
Naturally, a Zen master also has preferences. When he sleeps he does not
sleep on thorns, he sleeps on his bed. This is a preference, not a
choice – if he HAS to sleep on the thorns he will sleep there too. If
the bed is not avail able and sleep is coming on, he will sleep on the
thorns too. But again this is not a choice; just in that circumstance it
is the only possible thing to do.</p><p>He eats food, he does not eat stones – that is a preference, not a
choice. Remember, a Zen master also walks and goes through the door, not
through the wall. That is just a preference. That’s what this master is
saying: “Yes, some spit at the Buddha and some worship the Buddha. I
prefer worship.”</p><p><br></p><p>But he is not serious about it. A Christian cannot be so easy about
it – if somebody spits on Christ he will be mad, he will kill the man!
He will not be able to tolerate this, although Christianity goes on
talking about tolerance and love and forgiving the enemy. But he will
not forgive THIS enemy, he will kill this enemy.</p><p><br></p><p>If you spit on the Buddha and a Zen master is worshipping, he will
just look at you and think, “He prefers spitting, I prefer worship.”
There is no choice involved, but a great detachment. See the point, it
is of immense value. Preference is okay, choice is not good.</p><p><br></p><p>And when it is said “Become choiceless” a few foolish people start
thinking that they can’t prefer now – because they think preference is
choice. They start thinking that now they cannot prefer.</p><p><br></p><p>In India it has happened: there are mahatmas in India, saints – very
well-known, worshipped by thousands – whose whole prestige is because
they don’t prefer. If they are eating and you just sit in front of them
and piss there, it’s okay. Or they may be just sitting in dirt – it’s
okay, because they think this is choicelessness. Because of this idea,
India has become so dirty. If mahatmas are doing such great things, then
followers, if not THAT great, also follow a little bit – they also
should not choose. India has become so poor.</p><p><br></p><p>You need not make this mistake. If there is a possibility to be rich,
prefer being rich! don’t prefer being poor. But remember that this is a
preference, not a choice. If riches one day disappear – because all is
fleeting, THE DEW ON THE LOTUS LEAF, then it is perfectly okay, then be
poor. Don’t choose poverty, don’t choose richness. But preference is
perfectly good and sane.</p><p><br></p><p>If you can be healthy, prefer to be healthy. If you cannot be, then
it is okay, then accept your illness. But I am not saying choose
illness.</p><p><br></p><p>That calamity has happened in this country. For at least four or five
thousand years, this country has lived in such a nonsensical philosophy:
“Don’t choose.” That’s why this country remained poor. “Don’t even
prefer.” So whatsoever is, is okay. People have been dying and starving,
people are ugly, people are ill, their life is a dog’s life – but they
go on. They have lost the energy to live, to change, to transform
themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>Religion became very poisonous in India. This should not be repeated!
I have lived in poverty, I have lived in richness. And to be frank with
you, richness is better. So is health, so are all the good things of
life – but this is just a preference.</p><p><br></p><p>Preference simply means you are not very serious about it. If
playfully it is possible, good. You are not dead set for it, that if it
doesn’t happen you will commit suicide, that if you are not the richest
man in the world then you would like not to live at all – that is
foolishness.</p><p><br></p><p>Zen people don’t choose – they don’t choose the world, they don’t
choose renunciation of the world. But they have lived in the world; they
prefer. They say, “This seems to be more natural.” They live</p><p>like ordinary people, just as you live. But they live with an
extraordinary intelligence, they live with great awareness.</p><p><br></p><p>As choice disappears more and more and preference takes its place,
you become more and more intelligent, more alert, more conscious. A
lucidity, a grace, arises in your being.</p><p><br></p><p>THE DEW ON THE LOTUS LEAF UNDYED BY ITS COLOUR...</p><p>Ikkyu is saying: Be the dew on the lotus leaf. Although from the
outside the dew will look coloured by the lotus leaf – if the lotus leaf
is green the dewdrop will look green, will look emerald – yet it is not
coloured, it remains uncoloured. It is not affected by the lotus leaf;
that is only an appearance.</p><p><br></p><p>The Zen man lives in the world, but uncoloured. He may have a wife,
he may have children, but he remains uncoloured:</p><p><br></p><p>THE DEW ON THE LOTUS LEAF UNDYED BY ITS COLOUR...</p><p>He moves through the world, uncontaminated, unpolluted by it. The
world never enters in him. That’s why he is not worried about getting
out of it. He is not interested in going to the Himalayas. Why? For
what? He knows the world is not in him, so what is the point of going
anywhere else? The person who is escaping from the world is afraid of
the world, because when he is in the world the world enters into him and
he cannot resist. He is incapable, he is impotent, he is not yet aware
enough to be so that the world cannot enter into him. To avoid this, he
is escaping to the Himalayas. But how is he going to become more
conscious in the Himalayas?</p><p><br></p><p>If the world cannot make you more conscious, the Himalayas cannot
make you, certainly – it is impossible for the Himalayas. The world is a
challenge! And intelligence exists only when there is challenge. It is
sharpened by challenges – with greater challenges, greater intelligence
happens.</p><p><br></p><p>THE DEW ON THE LOTUS LEAF UNDYED BY ITS COLOUR, JUST AS IT IS,</p><p>IS THE REAL FORM OF BUDDHA.</p><p><br></p><p>The shopkeeper in the shop and the worker in the factory and the
farmer on the field – the dew on the lotus leaf, if it is uncoloured by
the leaf, then there is no problem. You can be a farmer or a shopkeeper
or a clerk or a mastqer, you can be anybody – that is only the form.
Deep inside, remain unattached to whatsoever is happening around you.
Preference is okay – don’t choose. And you are Buddha.</p><p><br></p><p>This very body the Buddha, and this very earth the lotus
paradise.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part6>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

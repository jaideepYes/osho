‌CHAPTER 1
The Medicine of the Unborn Undying
25 April 1978 am in Buddha Hall
“WE COME INTO THIS WORLD ALONE, WE DEPART ALONE” –
THIS ALSO IS ILLUSION.
I WILL TEACH YOU THE WAY NOT TO COME, NOT TO GO!
WE EAT, EXCRETE, SLEEP, AND GET UP; THIS IS OUR WORLD.
ALL WE HAVE TO DO AFTER THAT IS TO DIE.
I SHAN’T DIE, I SHAN’T GO ANYWHERE, I’LL BE HERE;</description>

‌CHAPTER 10
The Bodhisattvas’ Merciful Vow
8 May 1978 am in Buddha Hall
THE MIND WHICH IS UNATTACHED TO ALL THINGS IN THE WORLD, DOES NOT THINK, DOES NOT FEEL, IS FLUID AND FLEXIBLE.
ALL BUDDHAS AND BODHISATTVAS ACHIEVE BUDDHAHOOD AND NIRVANA AS A RESULT
OF THE MERCIFUL VOW. THE BUDDHA-NATURE
MEANS NON-BIRTH, NON-EXTINCTION; THEN KNOW THAT ILLUSION
IS BIRTH, DEATH, REINCARNATION.
THOUGH YOU PRACTISE VIRTUE,</description>

‌CHAPTER 11
Waiting For a Sweet One
9 May 1978 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1
WHAT IS A NATURAL BUDDHIST LIKE ME DOING LEADING SUFI DANCING? AND A NATURAL SUFI LIKE PRADEEPA DOING LEADING VIPASSANA AND ZAZEN?
ANEETA, THIS IS A CRAZY PLACE TO BE. I know it. The day I talked about the natural Sufi and the natural Buddhist, I looked in Aneeta’s eyes and the question was there.</description>

‌CHAPTER 12
In The House of the Moon
10 May 1978 am in Buddha Hall
THE MOON IS THE HOUSE,
THE MIND IS THE MASTER IN IT: WHEN WE UNDERSTAND THIS,
IT IS ONLY A TRANSITORY WORLD WE LIVE IN HERE.
DEEPLY THINKING OF IT, I AND OTHER PEOPLE –
THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE, AS THERE IS NO MIND BEYOND THIS MIND.
EVERY SPRING WHEN YOU SEE THE CHERRY BLOSSOMS BLOOM,</description>

‌CHAPTER 13
The Real Israel
11 May 1978 am in Buddha Hall

LAST NIGHT, IN A DREAM, I FOUND MYSELF ON A GIRDER HIGH IN THE AIR MOVING TOWARDS SOME DOOR OF SAFETY. THEN MY CLOTHES BEGAN TO GET CAUGHT ON SPLINTERS OF IRON, AND NEXT THE GIRDER BEGAN TO SPLIT. I TOLD MYSELF TO KEEP CALM, NOT TO LOOK DOWN, TO FORGET THE DANGER AND JUST DO ONE THING AT A TIME.</description>

‌CHAPTER 2
It Ain’t Easy!
26 April 1978 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1
WHAT IS THE DESIRE FOR PERFECTION?
ADHEERA, THE DESIRE FOR PERFECTION is the search for the lost womb. The paradise – lost. The child is utterly happy in the mother’s womb; that memory persists. It is not just a memory in the brain, it is in every cell of the body, every fiber of the body.</description>

‌CHAPTER 3
This Mountain Echo
27 April 1978 am in Buddha Hall
WHATEVER RUNS COUNTER
TO THE MIND AND WILL OF ORDINARY PEOPLE HINDERS THE LAW OF MEN
AND THE LAW OF BUDDHA. I WOULD LIKE
TO OFFER YOU SOMETHING, BUT IN THE DARUMA SECT WE HAVE NOTHING AT ALL.
AS IKKYU DOES NOT THINK OF HIS BODY AS IF IT WERE HIS BODY,</description>

‌CHAPTER 4
The Flight of the Alone to the Alone
28 April 1978 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1
IT ALL SEEMS SO SIMPLE – I JUST CAN’T UNDERSTAND IT. I KEEP GRASPING AT IT AND IT ELUDES ME, A MUSIC THAT CAN ALMOST BE SMELT, A TASTE THAT CAN ALMOST BE FELT. SOMETIMES I AM ON THE VERY THRESHOLD; OTHER TIMES IT’S NOT IN A MILLION YEARS, NOT FOR ME.</description>

‌CHAPTER 5
The Secret of the Drowned Man
29 April 1978 am in Buddha Hall
MORE FRAIL AND ILLUSORY
THAN NUMBERS WRITTEN ON WATER, OUR SEEKING FROM THE BUDDHA FELICITY IN THE AFTER-WORLD. ALREADY, OVER THE HEART
NOT A CLOUD IS HANGING, AND NO MOUNTAIN IS THERE
FOR THE MOON TO HIDE BEHIND.
IN OUR WAY THROUGH THIS WORLD OF BIRTH AND DEATH,</description>

‌CHAPTER 6
Buddhas With Closed Eyes
30 April 1978 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WAITING FOR GODOT AND WAITING FOR GOD?
NO DIFFERENCE AT ALL. All waiting is waiting for Godot, because all waiting is in vain. You cannot wait for God, because God has already arrived. God is already the case; God is not in the future.</description>

‌CHAPTER 7
Breaking Through the Bottom
1 May 1978 am in Buddha Hall
ON THE SEA OF DEATH AND LIFE, THE DIVER’S BOAT IS FREIGHTED WITH “IS” AND “IS NOT”.
BUT IF THE BOTTOM IS BROKEN THROUGH, “IS AND”IS NOT” DISAPPEAR.
THE MIND CANNOT BECOME THE BUDDHA; THE BODY CANNOT BECOME THE BUDDHA; ONLY WHAT CANNOT BECOME THE BUDDHA CAN BECOME THE BUDDHA.</description>

‌CHAPTER 8
And the Twain Are Always Meeting
2 May 1978 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1
IS “SITTING SILENTLY DOING NOTHING” THE SAME AS “LOOKING INTO ONE’S OWN BEING”?
NO, IT IS NOT THE SAME. Looking, into one’s own being is still doing something. Doing nothing is precisely that – doing nothing, neither looking out nor looking in. Looking is a kind of doing – even if you are trying to observe, you are TRYING; effort is involved.</description>

‌CHAPTER 9
Simply Stoned on Freedom
7 May 1978 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
THE STRONGEST EMOTION THAT I HAVE IS HATING DEATH. I WANT TO KILL IT! ONCE AND FOR ALL! THE SECOND THING IS: I FEEL EXTREME PAIN WHEN I REALIZE THAT I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO THANK YOU. IS THERE A CONNECTION?
DEVA BHAKTA, TO HATE DEATH IS TO HATE LIFE.</description>

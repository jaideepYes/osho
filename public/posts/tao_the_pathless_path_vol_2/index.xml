JESUS, BUDDHA AND T.D. SUZUKI HAVE BEEN MY MASTERS FOR FIVE YEARS NOW. WHENEVER I HAD A PROBLEM I WOULD CALL ON JESUS’ NAME FOR HELP. NOW YOU ARE MY MASTER. WHAT CAN I DO WITH THE REST OF THEM? JESUS SAYS A MAN CAN ONLY SERVE ONE MASTER.</description>

The first question:
Question 1
ONCE YOU SAID THAT KRISHNA WAS A BRAHMIN, BUT REALLY HE WAS A KSHATRIYA. NOBODY IS READY TO ACCEPT HIM AS A BRAHMIN. WHICH IS CORRECT?
WHEN I SAY SOMETHING there is no need to ask anybody about it. Meditate over it.
When I said that Krishna was a BRAHMIN I mean that he has known the ultimate truth.</description>

Question 1
YOU HAVE TALKED MUCH ON LOVE, RELATIONSHIPS, UNION, ETC. IS THERE A MERGING BETWEEN THE TAO AND TANTRA?
TANTRA MEANS TECHNIQUE – and Tao can have no relationship with any technique whatsoever. Tao is non-methodological, non-technical. Tao means spontaneity. How can spontaneity have a technique? You cannot practise it; if you practise it you miss it.</description>

LUNG SHU SAID TO THE PHYSICIAN WEN CHIH:
‘YOUR CRAFT IS SUBTLE. I HAVE AN ILLNESS, CAN YOU CURE IT?’
‘YOU HAVE ONLY TO COMMAND. TELL ME THE SYMPTOMS OF YOUR ILLNESS.’
’I DO NOT THINK IT AN HONOUR IF THE WHOLE DISTRICT PRAISES ME NOR A DISGRACE IF THE WHOLE STATE REVILES ME; I HAVE NO JOY WHEN I WIN, NO ANXIETY WHEN I LOSE; I LOOK IN THE SAME WAY AT LIFE AND DEATH, RICHES AND POVERTY, OTHER MEN AND PIGS, MYSELF AND OTHER MEN; I DWELL IN MY OWN HOUSE AS THOUGH LODGING IN AN INN, AND LOOK AT MY OWN NEIGHBOURHOOD AS THOUGH IT WERE A FOREIGN AND BARBAROUS COUNTRY.</description>

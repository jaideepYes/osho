Nobody has ever been able to surpass him. He has mapped the inner world of consciousness as accurately as it is possible; he has almost done an impossible job.\nI have heard a story about Ramakrishna…\nOne day he said to his disciples, “I will tell you everything today and will not keep anything secret.”\nHe described clearly the centers and the corresponding experiences up to the heart and throat, and then pointing to the spot between the eyebrows he said, “The supreme self is directly known and the individual experiences samadhi when the mind comes here. There remains then but a thin transparent screen separating the supreme self and the individual self. The sadhak then experiences…”\nSaying this, the moment he started to describe in detail the realization of supreme self, he was plunged in samadhi and became unconscious. When the samadhi came to an end and he came back, he tried again to describe it and was again in samadhi; again he became unconscious.\nAfter repeated attempts, Ramakrishna broke into tears and told his disciples that it was impossible to speak about it.\nBut Ramakrishna has tried, has tried in many ways, from different directions, and this always happened, his whole life. Whenever he comes beyond the third-eye center and is coming nearer sahasrar, he is so deeply caught hold of by something inner that the very remembrance of it, the very effort to describe it, and he is gone. For hours he will remain unconscious. It’s natural because the bliss of sahasrar is such, one is almost overpowered by it. The bliss is so oceanic that one is possessed by it and taken over. One is no longer oneself, once you transcend the third eye.\nRamakrishna tried and failed; could not describe it. Many others have not even tried. Lao Tzu for his whole life resisted saying anything about the world of Tao because of this. Nothing can be said about it, and the moment you try to say it, you are plunged into an inner whirlwind, whirlpool. You are lost, drowned. You are bathed in such beauty and beautitude that you cannot utter a single word.\nBut Patanjali has done the impossible. He has described as exactly as possible each step, each integration, each chakra – its functioning, and how to\ntranscend it, up to sahasrar. And he has even indicated beyond. On each chakra, on each wheel of energy, a certain integration happens.\nLet me tell you: at the sex center, the first center – the most primitive but the most natural, the one that is available to all – the integration happens between the outer and the inner. Of course it is momentary. A woman meeting a man or a man meeting a woman come for a single moment, a split moment, where the outer and inner meet and mingle and merge into each other. That’s the beauty of sex, the orgasm, that two energies, the complementary energies, meet and become one whole. But it is going to be momentary because the meeting is through the most gross element, the body. The body can touch surfaces but it cannot really enter the other. It is like ice cubes. If you put two ice cubes together, they can touch each other, but if they melt and become water, then they meet and mingle with each other. Then they go to the very center. And if the water evaporates, then the meeting becomes very, very deep. Then there is no I, no thou, no inner, no outer.\nThe first center, the sex center, gives you a certain integration. That’s why there is so much hankering for sex. It is natural. It is in itself beneficial and good. But if you stop there, you have stopped in the porch of a palace. The porch is good, it leads you into the palace, but it is not a place to make your abode, it is not a place to stop forever – and the bliss that is waiting for you on higher integrations of other centers will be missed. In comparison to that bliss and happiness and joy, the beauty of sex is nothing, the pleasure of sex is nothing. It simply gives you a momentary glimpse.\nThe second chakra is the hara. At the hara, life and death meet. If you reach to the second center, you reach to a higher orgasm of integration; life meeting death, sun meeting moon. And the meeting is inner now, so the meeting can be more permanent, more stable, because you are not dependent on anybody else. Now you are meeting your own inner woman or your own inner man.\nThe third center is the navel. There the positive and the negative meet – the positive electricity and the negative electricity. Their meeting is even higher than life and death because the electric energy, the prana, the bioplasma or bioenergy, is deeper than life and death. It exists before life, it exists after death. Life and death exist because of bioenergy. This meeting of bioenergy at the navel, nabhi, gives you even a higher experience of being one: integrated, a unity.\nThen is the heart: at the heart center, the lower and the higher meet. At the heart center: the prakriti and purusha, the sexual and the spiritual, the worldly and the other-worldly – or you can call it the meeting of heaven and earth. It is still higher because for the first time something of the beyond dawns – you can\nsee the sun rising at the horizon. You are still rooted in the earth, but your branches are spreading into the sky. You have become a meeting. That’s why the heart center gives the highest and the most refined experience ordinarily available – the experience of love. The experience of love is the meeting of earth and heaven; so love is in a way earthly, and in another way heavenly.\nIf Jesus defined God as love, this is the reason because in human consciousness, love seems to be the higher glimpse.\nOrdinarily people never go beyond the heart center. Even to reach to the heart center seems to be difficult, almost impossible. People remain at the sex center. If they are trained deeply in yoga, karate, aikido, tai chi, then they reach to the second center, the hara. If they are trained in a deep mechanism of breathing, prana, then they reach the navel center. And if they are trained how to look beyond earth and how to see beyond the body and how to look so deeply and so sensitively that you are no longer confined to the gross, and the subtle can penetrate its first rays into you – only then, the heart.\nAll paths of devotion – bhakti yoga – work on the heart center. Tantra starts from the sex center, Tao starts from the hara center. Yoga starts from the navel center. Bhakti yoga, paths of devotion and love, Sufis and others, start from the heart center.\nHigher than the heart is the throat center. Again there happens another integration, even more superior, more subtle. This center is the center of receiving and giving. When the child is born he receives from the throat center. First, life enters him from the throat center – he sucks air, breathes; and then he sucks milk from his mother. The child functions from the throat center, but it is half functioning and soon he forgets about it. He just receives, he cannot give yet; his love is passive. And if you are asking for love, then you remain juvenile, you remain childish. Unless you mature – so that you can give love – you have not become a grown-up. Everybody asks for love, demands love, and almost nobody gives. That’s the misery all over the world. And everybody who demands thinks that he is giving, believes that he is giving.\nI have looked into thousands of people – all hungry for love, thirsty for love, but nobody in any way trying to give. And they all believe that they are giving but not receiving. Once you give you naturally receive. It has never happened otherwise. The moment you give, love rushes into you. It has nothing to do with people; it has something to do with the cosmic energy of existence.\nThe throat center is the meeting of receiving and giving. You receive from it and you give from it. That is the meaning of Christ’s saying that unless you become a child again…. If you translate it into the yoga terminology it will mean: unless you come to the throat center again… The child forgets by and\nby.\nIf you look into Freudian psychology, you will have a parallel. Freud says the first stage of the child is oral, the second stage is anal, and the third stage is genital. The whole of Freudian psychology ends with the third. Of course it is a very poor psychology, very rudimentary, fragmentary, and concerned with the very lower functioning of human beings. Oral – yes, the child uses the throat center, just to receive. And once he has started receiving, his being moves to the anal.\nHave you seen that a few people cling to the oral, even up to their death? These are the people you will find smoking; these are oral people. They still go on… The smoke, the cigarette, the cigar, gives them a feeling as if something hot like mother’s milk is passing through the throat center; they remain confined to the oral and they cannot give. If a person is a chain-smoker, heavy smoker, almost always he is not a giver of love. He demands, but he will not give.\nPeople who are smoking too much are always interested in women’s breasts – bound to be because a cigarette is a substitute for the nipple. I am not saying that people who are not smokers are not interested in women’s breasts. Those who smoke are interested; those who don’t smoke are also interested – they may be chewing pan or gum or something else, or they may be simply interested in pornography, or they may be just obsessed by the breast continuously. In their mind, in their dream, in their imagination, fantasy, the breast – breasts and breasts go on floating all around them. These are oral people, stuck.\nWhen Jesus says you have to be a child again, he means you have to come back to the throat center, but with a new energy to give. All creative people are givers. They may sing a song for you or dance a dance or write a poem or paint a picture or tell you a story. For all these, the throat center is again used as a center to give. The meeting of receiving and giving happens at the throat. The capacity to receive and to give is one of the greatest integrations.\nThere are people who are only capable of receiving. They will remain miserable because you never become rich by receiving. You become rich by giving. In fact, you possess only that which you can give. If you cannot give it, you simply believe that you possess. You don’t possess it; you are not a master. If you cannot give your money, then you are not the master of it. Then money is the master. If you can give it, then certainly you are the master. This will look like a paradox, but let me repeat it: you are the possessor only of that which you give. The moment you give, in that very moment you have become a possessor, enriched; giving enriches you.\nMiserly people are the most miserable and poor people in the world – poorer than the poor. They cannot give: they are stuck. They go on hoarding. Their hoarding becomes a burden on their being – it does not free them. In fact, if you have something you will become freer. But look at the misers. They have much, but they are burdened; they are not free. Even beggars are freer than they. What has happened to them? They have used their throat center just to receive. Not only have they not used their throat center to give, they have not even moved to the second Freudian center, anal. These people are always constipated; hoarders, misers, always suffer from constipation. Remember, I am not saying that all people who have constipation are misers; there may be other reasons. But misers are certainly constipated.\nFreud says that there is something in gold and excreta. Both look yellow, and people who are constipatory are too attracted to gold. Otherwise gold has no existential value – some psychological value, but no existential value. You cannot eat it, you cannot drink it. What can you do with it? Even a glass of water is more valuable existentially. But why has gold become so valuable? Why are people so obsessed with gold? They have not moved from the oral to the anal. They are constipated in their inner being. Now their whole life will reflect their constipation: they will become hoarders of gold. Gold is symbolic. The yellowness gives them some idea.\nHave you watched small children? It is difficult to persuade them to go to the toilet, they have almost to be forced to go to the toilet. And even then they insist, “Nothing is happening. Can I come back?” They are learning the first lessons of miserliness – how to hold on. How to hold on, how not to give even that which is useless, even that which is harmful if you keep it within you. Even poison – it is difficult for them to leave it, to renounce it.\nI have heard about two Buddhist bhikkhus…\nOne of them was a miser and a hoarder and he used to collect money and keep it, and the other used to laugh at this foolish attitude. Whatsoever will come on his way, he will use it, he will never hoard it. One night they came across a river. It was evening; the sun was setting and it was dangerous to stay there. They had to go to the other shore. There was a town; this side was simply wilderness.\nThe hoarder said, “Now you don’t have any money, so we cannot pay the ferryman? What do you say now about it? You are against hoarding. Now if I don’t have any money we both will die. You see the point?” He said, “Money is needed.”\nThe man who believed in renunciation laughed, but he didn’t say anything.\nThen the hoarder paid and they crossed the river; they reached the other shore.\nThe hoarder again said, “Now remember, next time don’t start arguing with me. You see? Money helps. Without money we would have been dead. The whole night on the other shore, it was dangerous to survive – wild animals.”\nThe other bhikkhu laughed and he said, “But we have come across the river because you could renounce it. It is not because of hoarding that we have survived. If you had insisted on hoarding it and you were not going to pay the ferryman, we would have died. It is because you could renounce – because you could leave it, you could give it – that’s why we have survived.”\nThe argument must be continuing still. But remember, I am not against money. I am all for it, but use it! Possess it, own it; but your ownership arises only the moment you have become capable of giving it. At the throat center this new synthesis happens. You can accept and you can give.\nThere are people who change from one extreme to another. First they were incapable of giving, they could only receive; then they change, they go to the other extreme – now they can give but they cannot receive. That too is lopsidedness. A real man is capable of accepting gifts and giving them back. In India you will find many sannyasins, many so-called mahatmas, who will not touch money. If you give them any, they will shrink back, as if you have produced a snake or something poisonous. Their shrinking back shows that now they have moved to the other extreme: now they have become incapable of receiving. Again their throat center is half-functioning, and a center never functions really unless it functions fully – unless the wheel moves all the way, goes on moving and creates energy fields.\nThen is the third-eye center: At the third-eye center the right and left meet, pingala and ida meet, and become sushumna. The two hemispheres of the brain meet at the third eye: that is just between the two eyes. One eye represents the right, another eye represents the left, and it is just in the middle. The left and right brains meeting at the third eye is a very high synthesis. People have been capable of describing up to this point. That’s why Ramakrishna could describe up to the third eye. And when he started to talk about the final, the ultimate synthesis that happens at sahasrar, he again and again fell into silence, into samadhi. He was drowned in it; it was too much. It was floodlike; he was taken over to the ocean. He could not keep himself conscious, alert.\nThe ultimate synthesis happens at sahasrar, the crown chakra. Because of this sahasrar, all over the world kings, emperors, monarchs, and queens, use the crown. It has become formal, but basically it was accepted because unless\nyour sahasrar is functioning, how can you be a monarch, how can you be a king? How can you rule people if you have not even become a ruler of yourself? In the symbol of the crown a secret is hidden. The secret is that a person who has reached to the crown center, the ultimate synthesis of his being – only he should be the king or the queen, nobody else. Only he is capable of ruling others, because he has come to rule himself. He has become a master of himself; now he can be helpful to others also.\nReally, when you achieve to sahasrar, a crown flowers within you, a one- thousand-petaled lotus opens. No crown can be compared with it, but then it became just a symbol and the symbol has existed all over the world. That simply shows that everywhere people became alert and aware in one way or other of the ultimate synthesis in the sahasrar. Jews use the skullcap – it is exactly on the sahasrar. Hindus allow a bunch of hair, they call it choti, the peak, to grow exactly on the spot where the sahasrar is, or has to be. There are a few Christian societies which shave just that part of the head. When a master blesses a disciple, he puts his hand on the sahasrar. And if the disciple is really receptive, surrendered, he will suddenly feel an upsurge of energy, running from the sex center to the sahasrar.\nSometimes when I touch your head and you suddenly become sexual don’t be afraid, don’t shrink back, because that is how it should be. The energy is at the sex center. It starts uncoiling itself. You become afraid, you shrink, you repress it – what is happening? And becoming sexual at the feet of your master seems to be a little awkward, embarrassing. It is not. Allow it, let it be, and soon you will see it has passed the first center and the second and, if you are surrendered, within a second the energy is moving at the sahasrar and you will have a feeling of a new opening within you. That’s why a disciple is supposed to bow his head, so the master can touch the head.\nThe last synthesis is of object and subject, the outer and inner, again. In a sexual orgasm outer and inner meet, but momentarily. In sahasrar they meet permanently. That’s why I say one has to travel from sex to samadhi. In sex, ninety-nine percent is sex, one percent is sahasrar; in sahasrar, ninety-nine percent is sahasrar, one percent is sex. The two are joined, they are bridged, by deep currents of energy. So if you have enjoyed sex, don’t make your abode there. Sex is just a glimpse of sahasrar. Sahasrar is going to deliver a thousandfold, a millionfold, a bliss to you, benediction to you.\nThe outer and the inner meet, “I” and “thou” meet, man and woman meet, yin and yang meet; and the meeting is absolute. Then there is no parting, then there is no divorce.\nThis is called yoga. Yoga means the meeting of the two into one. In\nChristianity, mystics have called it unio mystica. That is the exact translation of yoga – unio mystica: the mysterious union. At the sahasrar the alpha and the omega meet, the beginning and the end. The beginning is in the sex center, sex is your alpha; samadhi is your omega. And unless alpha and omega meet, unless you have attained to this supreme union, you will remain miserable because your destiny is that. You will remain unfulfilled. You can be fulfilled only at this highest peak of synthesis.\nNow the sutras.\nPerforming samyama on their power of cognition, real nature, egoism, all pervasiveness, and functions brings mastery over the sense organs.\nThe first thing to be understood is that you have senses but you have lost sensitivity. Your senses are almost dull, dead. They are there hanging with you, but energy is not flowing in them; they are not alive limbs of your being. Something has deadened within you, has become cold, blocked. It has happened to the whole of humanity because of thousands of years of repression. And thousands of years of conditioning and ideologies which are against the body have crippled you. You live only for name’s sake.\nSo the first thing to be done is: your senses should become really alive and sensitive. Only then can they be mastered. You see but you don’t see deeply. You see only the surface of things. You touch but your touch has no warmth; nothing flows in and out from your touch. You hear also. The birds go on singing and you hear and you can say, “Yes, I am hearing,” and you are not wrong – you are hearing, but it never reaches to the very core of your being. It does not go dancing within you; it doesn’t help a flowering, an unfolding within you.\nThese senses have to be rejuvenated. Yoga is not against the body, remember. Yoga says go beyond the body, but it is not against the body. Yoga says use the body, don’t be used by it; but it is not against the body. Yoga says the body is your temple. You are in the body, and the body is so beautiful an organism, so complex and so subtle, so mysterious, and so many dimensions open through it. And those are the only doors and windows you will reach to existence through. So don’t deaden them; make them more alive. Let them vibrate, pulsate, and, what Stanley Keleman has said: “Let them ‘stream.’” That is exactly the right word: let them flow like a stream, rushing. You can have the sensation. Your hand, if it is rushing like a stream of energy: you will feel a tingling sensation, you will feel something inside the hand is flowing and wants to make contact, wants to be connected.\nWhen you love a woman or a man and you take her hand in your hand, if your hand is not streaming, this love is not going to be of any use. If your hand is not jumping and throbbing with energy and pouring energy into your woman or into your man, then this love is almost dead from the very beginning. Then this child is not born alive. Then sooner or later you will be finished – you are already finished. It will take a little time to recognize because your mind is also dull; otherwise you would not enter it because it is already dead. For what are you entering? You take time to recognize things because your sensitivity, brilliance, intelligence, is so clouded and confused.\nOnly a streaming love can become a source of blissfulness, of joy, of delight. But for that you will need your senses streaming.\nSometimes you have that glimpse also; and everybody had it when he was a child. Watch a child running after a butterfly. He is streaming, as if any moment he can jump out of his body. Watch a child when he is looking at a roseflower. See his eyes, the brilliance, the light that comes to his eyes. He is streaming. His eyes are almost dancing on the petals of the flower.\nThis is the way to be: be riverlike. And only then is it possible to master these senses. In fact, people have had a very wrong attitude. They think that if you want to master your senses, you have to make them almost dead. But then what is the point of mastering? You can kill, and you are the master. You can sit on the corpse. But what is the point of being a master? But this looked easier: first kill them and then you can master. If the body feels too strong, fast. Make it weak, and then you start feeling that you are the master – but you have killed the body. Remember, life has to be mastered, not dead things. They will not be of any use.\nBut this has been found to be a shortcut, so all the religions of the world have been using it. Destroy your body by and by. Disconnect yourself from the body. Don’t be in contact, remove yourself, become indifferent. When your body is almost a dead tree – no longer do leaves come to it, no longer does it flower, no longer do birds come to rest. It is just a dead stump. Of course you can master it, but now what are you going to gain from this mastery?\nThis is the problem; that’s why people don’t understand what Patanjali means.\nPerforming samyamaon their power of cognition… Your eyes see, your ears hear, your nose smells, your tongue tastes, your hands make contact, your feet make connectedness with the earth – that is their power of cognition.\nPerforming samyamaon their power of cognition… But they have to be powerful. Otherwise you will not be able to even feel what power is. These senses have to be so full of power, so high with power, that you can perform\nsamyama, that you can meditate upon them.\nRight now when you look at a flower, the flower is there, but have you ever felt your eyes? You see the flower, but have you felt the power of your eyes? It should be there because you are using your eyes to see the flower. And of course, eyes are more beautiful than any flower because all flowers have to come through the eyes. It is through the eyes that you have become aware of the world of flowers, but have you ever felt the power of the eyes? They are almost dull, dead. They have become passive, just like windows, receptive. They don’t go to their object.\nAnd power means being active. Power means your eyes going and almost touching the flower, your ears going and almost touching the songs of the birds, your hands going with the total energy in you, focused there and touching your beloved. Or you are lying down on the grass, and your whole body, full of power, meeting in a contact with the grass, having a dialogue with the grass. Or you are swimming in the river and whispering with the river and listening to the whispers of the river – connected, in communion – but power is needed.\nSo the first thing I would like you to do is when you see, really see, become the eyes. Forget everything. Let your whole energy flow through the eyes. Your eyes will be cleaned, bathed in an inner shower, and you will be able to see that these trees are no longer the same, the greenery is no longer the same. It has become greener, as if dust has disappeared from it. The dust was not on the trees, it was on your eyes. And you will see for the first time and you will hear for the first time.\nJesus goes on saying to his disciples, “If you have ears listen. If you have eyes see.” They were not all blind, and they were not all deaf. What does he mean? He means that you have almost become deaf and almost become blind. You see and yet you don’t see. You hear yet you don’t hear. It is not a power, it is not energy, it is not vital.\nPerforming samyanaon their power of cognition, real nature… Then you will be able to see what is the real nature of your senses. It is divine. Your body embodies the divine. It is the divine who has looked through your eyes.\nI remember Meister Eckhart’s famous saying. The day he realized and became enlightened, his friends and disciples and brothers asked, “What have you seen?” He laughed. He is the only one in the whole of Christianity who comes very close to Zen masters, almost a Zen master. He laughed. He said, “I have not seen the divine. It has seen itself through me. The divine has seen itself through me. These eyes are the divine’s. And what a game, what a play. It has seen itself through me.”\nWhen you really feel the nature of your senses, you will feel it is divine. It is existence who has moved through your hand. It is existence’s hand. All hands are its. It is existence who has loved through you. All love affairs are existence’s. And how can it be otherwise? Hindus call it leela – a play. It is existence who is calling you through the cuckoo, and it is existence who is listening through you. It is it and it alone spread all over.\nPerforming samyama on their power of cognition, real nature, egoism, all- pervasiveness, and functions brings mastery over the sense organs. This word egoism has to be understood because in Sanskrit we have three words for the ego and in English there is only one word. That creates difficulty. The Sanskrit word in the sutra is asmita, so let me first explain it to you.\nThere are three words: ahankar, asmita, atma. All mean I. Ahankar can be translated as the ego – the very gross, too much emphasis on “I.” For asmita there is no word in English. Asmita means amness. I am; in ego the emphasis is on “I”; in asmita the emphasis is on “am.” Amness, purer than ego. Still it is there, but in a very different form. Amness. And atma: even amness has disappeared. In the ego “I am”; in asmita only “am”; in atma even that has disappeared. In atma there is pure being, neither I nor amness.\nIn this sutra, asmita is used, amness. Remember, the ego is of the mind; senses have no ego. They have a certain amness but no ego. The ego is of the mind. Your eyes don’t have any ego; your hands don’t have any ego. They have a certain amness. That’s why if your skin has to be replaced and somebody else’s skin is planted on you, your body will reject it because the body knows “it is not mine.” So your own skin has to be replaced from some other part of the body, from your thighs. Your own skin has to be replaced, otherwise the body will reject. The body will not accept it: “It is not mine.” The body has no I but it has an amness.\nIf you need blood, anybody’s blood won’t do. The body will not accept all sorts of blood, only a particular blood. It has its own amness. That will be accepted; some other blood will be rejected. The body has its own feel of its being – very unconscious, very subtle and pure, but it is there.\nYour eyes are yours, just like your thumbprints. Everything yours is yours. Now physiologists say that everybody’s heart is different, of a different shape. In physiology books, the picture that you will find is not a real picture. It is just average. It is just imagined. Otherwise each person’s heart has a different shape. Even each person’s kidney has a different shape. These parts all have their signatures; everybody is so unique. That is the amness.\nYou will never be here again, you have never been before, so move cautiously and alertly and happily. Just think: the glory of your being. Just\nthink: that you are so superb and unique. Existence has vested much in you – never imitate because that will be a betrayal. Be yourself. Let that be your religion. All else is politics. Don’t be a Hindu, don’t be a Mohammedan, don’t be a Christian. Be religious, but there is only one religion, and that is just being yourself, authentically yourself.\nPerforming samyama on their power of cognition, real nature, – asmita, the subtle amness – all-pervasiveness, and functions brings mastery over the sense organs. And if you meditate on these things, you will become a master. Meditation brings mastery; nothing else brings mastery except meditation. If you meditate on your eye, first you will see the roseflower; by and by you will be able to see the eye that is seeing. Then you have become a master of the eye. Once you have seen the seeing eye, you have become a master. Now you can use all its energies; and they are all-pervasive. Your eyes are not as limited as you think them to be. They can see many more things which you have not seen. They can penetrate many more mysteries that you have not even dreamed about. But you are not master of your eyes, and you have used them in a very haphazard way, not knowing what you are doing.\nAnd in contact so much with objects, you have forgotten the subjectivity of your eyes. It happens if you keep company with someone – by and by you become influenced by him. You have been in contact with objects too much and you have forgotten the inner quality of your senses. You see things, but you never see your seeing. You hear the songs, but you never hear the subtle vibration that goes on within you, the sound of your being.\nLet me tell you an anecdote…\nI have heard that an extremely confident tramp had enormous nerve. He had just completed a very large meal in a swanky restaurant when he announced to the manager, “My good man, I have really enjoyed your food, but unfortunately I cannot afford to pay for any of it at all. I have not a penny to my name.\n“Now don’t get angry. I am by profession a beggar, as you may see. I happen to be an extremely talented beggar too. I can go out and within one hour get the money I owe you for this meal. Naturally though, you cannot trust me to come back, and this I fully understand. You would be most welcome to accompany me, but can a man like you, a well-known restaurant owner, afford to be seen with a man of my caliber? No. So I have, sir, the perfect solution to our little problem. I will wait here and you go out and beg until you have the cost of this meal.”\nIf you keep company with a beggar, you will become a beggar. He will suggest in a thousand and one ways to you to become like him.\nWe have kept company with objects so long that we have forgotten our subjectivity. We have remained focused outwardly so long on things that we have forgotten that we are persons. This long association with objects has completely destroyed your image of yourself. You have to come back home.\nIn yoga, when you start seeing your seeing eye, you come across a subtle energy. They call it tanmatra. When you can see your eye seeing, just hidden behind the eyes you see a tremendous energy – that is tanmatra, the energy of the eye. Behind the ear you see tremendous energy accumulated, tanmatra of the ear. Behind your genital organs you see tremendous energy accumulated, tanmatra of sexuality. And so on, so forth. Everywhere behind your senses there is a pool of energy, unused. Once you know it, you can pour that energy into your eyes, and then you will see visions which only sometimes poets see, painters see. Then you will hear sounds which only sometimes musicians hear, poets hear. And then you will touch things which only sometimes in rare moments lovers know how to touch.\nYou will become alive, streaming.\nOrdinarily you have been taught to repress your senses, not to know them. It is very foolish, but very convenient.\nIt happened…\nAfter a rural wedding, the bride and the groom climbed into the wagon and set out for their farm home. About a mile down the road, the horse stumbled. “That’s one!” shouted the groom.\nThey continued on and the horse stumbled again. “That is two!” shouted the groom.\nAs they neared the farm, the horse stumbled again. “That is three!” shouted the groom and, seizing a gun from behind the seat, put a bullet through the horse’s brain.\nThe bride sat aghast. Then, in no uncertain terms, she told her new husband what she thought of his action. He sat quietly until she subsided, then pointed at her and shouted, “That is one!”\nThe couple lived happily for sixty years.\nBut that happiness cannot be real happiness. Easy to repress at the point of a gun, but then what sort of love will happen between these two people? The gun will always stand in between, and the wife will always be afraid that now any moment he is going to say, “Now this is two! Now this is three!” and finished!\nThat’s what you have done with your senses, with your body – you have repressed it. But you were helpless. I don’t say that you are responsible for repressing it. You were brought up in such a way, nobody allowed your senses freedom. In the name of love, only repression continues. The mothers, the fathers, the society, they go on repressing. By and by they teach you a trick, and the trick is not to accept yourself, deny. Everything has to be channeled into conformity. Your wilderness has to be thrown into the dark part of your soul and a small corner has to be clean, like a drawing room, where you can see people, meet people, and live and forget all about your wilder being: your real existence. Your fathers and your mothers are not responsible either because they were brought up in the same way.\nSo nobody is responsible. But once you know it, and you don’t do anything, then you become responsible. Being near me I am going to make you very, very responsible because you will know it, and then if you don’t do anything, then you cannot throw the responsibility on anybody else. Then you are going to be responsible!\nNow you know about how you have destroyed your senses, and you know also how to revive them. Do something. Throw the gun away completely, the repressive mind completely. Unblock yourself. Start flowing again, start connecting again with your being, start connecting with your senses again. You are like a disconnected telephone line. Everything looks perfectly okay, the telephone is there but the line is disconnected. Your eyes are there, your hands are there, your ears are there, but the line is disconnected. Reconnect it. If it can be disconnected, it can be reconnected. Others have disconnected it because they were also taught in the same way, but you can reconnect it.\nAll my meditations are to give you a streaming energy. That’s why I call them dynamic methods. Old meditations were just to sit silently, not to do anything. I give you active methods because when you are streaming with energy you can sit silently, that will do, but right now first you have to become alive.\nFrom this follows instantaneous cognition without the use of the body,\nand complete mastery over pradhana, prakriti, the material world.\nIf you can see tanmatras, the subtle energies of your senses, you will become capable of using your cognition without the grosser instruments. If you know that behind the eye there is an accumulated pool of energy, you can close your eyes and use that energy directly. Then you will be able to see without opening your eyes. That’s what telepathy, clairvoyance, clairaudience is.\nIn Russia, there is a woman who has been investigated scientifically who stands just twenty feet away from any object and starts pulling it, just by energy. She makes movements with her hands, twenty feet away, as you have seen a hypnotist making passes, she simply draws, gestures. Within fifteen minutes, things start moving toward her. She has not touched them. Much investigation has been done about what happens. And that woman loses at least half a pound in weight in a half-hour experiment. Certainly she is losing some sort of energy.\nThis is what yoga calls tanmatra. Ordinarily you use the energy through the hand, when you pick something up: a stone, a rock. You carry it; you use the same energy through the hand. But if you know the energy directly, you can drop the use of the hand. The energy can move the object directly. In the same way – telepathy: you can hear or read people’s thoughts or can see faraway scenes. Once you know the tanmatra, the subtle energy that is being used by your eyes, the eyes can be discarded. Once you know that it is not really the sense that is functioning but the energy, you are freed of the sense.\nI have heard a story…\nSo this guy phoned Cohen \u0026 Goldberg, wholesalers. “Put me through to Mr. Cohen, please.”\n“I am afraid Mr. Cohen has gone out, sir,” said the switchboard girl. “Then get me Mr. Goldberg.”\n“I am afraid Mr. Goldberg is tied up at present, sir.” “Okay, I will phone back later.”\nTen minutes later: “Mr. Goldberg, please.”\n“I am afraid Mr. Goldberg is still tied up, sir.” “I will phone back.”\nHalf an hour later: “Get me Mr. Goldberg.”\n“I am terribly sorry, sir, but Mr. Goldberg is still tied up.” “I will phone back.”\nAnother half an hour later: “Goldberg!”\n“I have dreadful news for you, sir. Mr. Goldberg is still tied up.”\n“But look, this is ridiculous. How can you run a business like that? One partner is out all morning and the other is tied up for hours on end. What is going on there?”\n“Well, you see, sir, whenever Mr. Cohen goes out, he ties up Mr. Goldberg.”\nThis is what is happening inside you also. Whenever you go out, through the eyes, through the hands, through your genital organs, through your ears –\nwhenever you go out, continuously a certain type of bondage and tying is created. By and by you become tight with the particular sense – eyes, ears – because that is from where you go out, again, again, again. By and by you forget the energy that is going out.\nThis getting into bondage with the senses is the whole world, the samsara. How to untie yourself from the senses? And once you are tied up with the senses, you start thinking in terms of them. You forget yourself.\nAnother story…\nA disciple wanted very much to renounce the world and follow his guru, but he said that his wife and family loved him too much and he was unable to leave his home.\nThe guru came up with a plan. The man was taught certain yogic secrets so that he could give the appearance to all who looked upon his body that he was deceased. The next day the man followed instructions and his body was besieged with the wailings and sobbings of his wife and family.\nThe guru appeared at the door in the guise of a magician and told the family that if they loved this man so much, he could bring him back to life. He said that the man would live if someone would die in his place by drinking the potion he had.\nEach member of the family had an excuse that made it necessary to keep his own life, and the wife added, “Anyway, he is already dead; we will manage.”\nAt this the yogi stood up and said, “Woman, if you can live without me, then I can go with my guru.” He faced the teacher and said, “Let us go, sir, Revered Master. I will follow you.”\nThe whole attachment to the senses is as if you are the senses, as if you cannot live without them, as if your whole life is confined to them. But you are not confined to them. You can renounce them, and you can still live, and live on a higher plane. Difficult! Just as if you want to persuade a seed, “Die, and soon a beautiful plant will be born.” How can he believe, because he will be dead? No seed has ever known that by his death a new sprout comes up, a new life arises. So how to believe it? Or if you go near an egg and you want to persuade the bird within, “Come out,” but how is the bird to believe that there is any possibility of life without the egg? Or if you talk to a child inside the womb of a mother and tell him, “Come out, don’t be afraid,” but he knows nothing outside the womb. The womb has been his whole life; he knows only that. He is afraid. The same is the situation: surrounded by the senses, we live in a sort of confinement, an imprisonment.\nOne has to be a little daring, courageous. Right now, wherever you are and whatsoever you are, nothing is happening to you. Then take the risk. Then move into the unknown. Then try to find a new way of life.\nFrom this follows instantaneous cognition without the use of the body, and complete mastery over prakriti, the material world. Up to now you have been possessed by the material world. Once you know that you have your own energy, totally independent from the material world, you become a master. No longer does world possess you; you possess it. Only those who renounce become the real masters.\nOnly after the awareness of the distinction between sattva and purusha\ndoes supremacy and knowledge arise over all states of existence.\nAnd the subtlest discrimination has to be made between sattva and purusha – intelligence and awareness. It is very easy to separate yourself from the body. The body is so gross you can feel it, you cannot be it. You must be inside it. It is easy to see that you cannot be the eyes. You must be someone hidden behind who looks through the eyes; otherwise who will look through the eyes? Your glasses cannot look. Behind the glasses, eyes are needed. Your eyes are also like glasses. They are glasses; they cannot look. You are needed somewhere behind to look.\nBut the subtlest identification is with intelligence. Your power to think, your power of intellect, understanding, is the subtlest thing. It is very difficult to discriminate between awareness and intelligence. But it can be discriminated.\nBy and by, step-by-step, first, know that you are not the body. Let that understanding grow deep, crystallize. Then know that you are not the senses. Let that understanding grow, crystallize. Then know that you are not the tanmatras, the energy pools behind the senses. Let that grow and crystallize. And then you will be able to see that intelligence is also a pool of energy. It is the common pool, in which eyes pour their energy, ears pour their energy, hands pour their energy. All the senses are like rivers and intelligence is the central thing, in which they bring information and pour.\nWhatever your mind knows is given by the senses. You have seen colors: your mind knows them. If you are color-blind, if you cannot see the color green, then your mind does not know anything about green.\nBernard Shaw lived his whole life unaware that he was color-blind. It is very difficult to come to know it, but one accidental incident allowed him to become\naware. On one of his birthdays somebody presented him a suit, but the tie was missing, so he went to the market to find a tie which could fit with the suit. The suit was green, and he started purchasing a yellow tie. His secretary was watching, and she asked, “What are you doing? It won’t fit. The suit is green and the tie is yellow.”\nHe said, “Is there a difference between these two?”\nFor seventy years he had lived not knowing that he could not see yellow. He saw green. Whether it was yellow or green, both colors looked green. Yellow was not part of his mind; the eyes never poured that information into the mind.\nThe eyes are like servants, information collectors, public relations officers, roaming all over the world, collecting things, pouring into the mind. They go on feeding the mind; the mind is the central pool.\nFirst you have to become aware that you are not the eye, not the energy that is hidden behind the eye, then you will be able to see that every sense is pouring into the mind. You are not this mind, also. You are the one who is seeing it being poured. You are just standing on the bank, all the rivers pouring into the ocean – you are the watcher, the witness.\nSwami Ram has said: “Science is difficult to define, but perhaps the most essential feature of it involves the study of something which is external to the observer. The techniques of meditation offer an approach which allows one to be external to one’s own internal states.”\n“The techniques of meditation offer an approach which allows one to be external to one’s own internal states” – and the ultimate of meditation is to know that whatever you can know, you are not it. Whatever can be reduced to a known object, you are not it, because you cannot be reduced to an object. You remain eternally subject – the knower, the knower, the knower. And the knower can never be reduced to the known.\nThis is purusha, awareness. This is the final understanding that arises out of yoga. Meditate over it.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"8606","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_chakra_book/part13/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_chakra_book/>The Chakra Book</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter 8: Patanjali and the Path of Yoga</h1><div class=post-meta>41 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;8606 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Chakra_Book/part13.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part12>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

Nobody
has ever been able to surpass him. He has mapped the inner world of
consciousness as accurately as it is possible; he has almost done an
impossible job.</p><p>I have heard a story about Ramakrishna…</p><p><br></p><p>One day he said to his disciples, “I will tell you everything today
and will not keep anything secret.”</p><p>He described clearly the centers and the corresponding experiences up
to the heart and throat, and then pointing to the spot between the
eyebrows he said, “The supreme self is directly known and the individual
experiences <em>samadhi</em> when the mind comes here. There remains
then but a thin transparent screen separating the supreme self and the
individual self. The <em>sadhak</em> then experiences…”</p><p>Saying this, the moment he started to describe in detail the
realization of supreme self, he was plunged in <em>samadhi</em> and
became unconscious. When the <em>samadhi</em> came to an end and he came
back, he tried again to describe it and was again in <em>samadhi</em>;
again he became unconscious.</p><p>After repeated attempts, Ramakrishna broke into tears and told his
disciples that it was impossible to speak about it.</p><p><br></p><p>But Ramakrishna has tried, has tried in many ways, from different
directions, and this always happened, his whole life. Whenever he comes
beyond the third-eye center and is coming nearer <em>sahasrar</em>, he
is so deeply caught hold of by something inner that the very remembrance
of it, the very effort to describe it, and he is gone. For hours he will
remain unconscious. It’s natural because the bliss of <em>sahasrar</em>
is such, one is almost overpowered by it. The bliss is so oceanic that
one is possessed by it and taken over. One is no longer oneself, once
you transcend the third eye.</p><p>Ramakrishna tried and failed; could not describe it. Many others have
not even tried. Lao Tzu for his whole life resisted saying anything
about the world of Tao because of this. Nothing can be said about it,
and the moment you try to say it, you are plunged into an inner
whirlwind, whirlpool. You are lost, drowned. You are bathed in such
beauty and beautitude that you cannot utter a single word.</p><p>But Patanjali has done the impossible. He has described as exactly as
possible each step, each integration, each chakra – its functioning, and
how to</p><p>transcend it, up to <em>sahasrar</em>. And he has even indicated
beyond. On each chakra, on each wheel of energy, a certain integration
happens.</p><p>Let me tell you: at the sex center, the first center – the most
primitive but the most natural, the one that is available to all – the
integration happens between the outer and the inner. Of course it is
momentary. A woman meeting a man or a man meeting a woman come for a
single moment, a split moment, where the outer and inner meet and mingle
and merge into each other. That’s the beauty of sex, the orgasm, that
two energies, the complementary energies, meet and become one whole. But
it is going to be momentary because the meeting is through the most
gross element, the body. The body can touch surfaces but it cannot
really enter the other. It is like ice cubes. If you put two ice cubes
together, they can touch each other, but if they melt and become water,
then they meet and mingle with each other. Then they go to the very
center. And if the water evaporates, then the meeting becomes very, very
deep. Then there is no I, no thou, no inner, no outer.</p><p>The first center, the sex center, gives you a certain integration.
That’s why there is so much hankering for sex. It is natural. It is in
itself beneficial and good. But if you stop there, you have stopped in
the porch of a palace. The porch is good, it leads you into the palace,
but it is not a place to make your abode, it is not a place to stop
forever – and the bliss that is waiting for you on higher integrations
of other centers will be missed. In comparison to that bliss and
happiness and joy, the beauty of sex is nothing, the pleasure of sex is
nothing. It simply gives you a momentary glimpse.</p><p>The second chakra is the hara. At the hara, life and death meet. If
you reach to the second center, you reach to a higher orgasm of
integration; life meeting death, sun meeting moon. And the meeting is
inner now, so the meeting can be more permanent, more stable, because
you are not dependent on anybody else. Now you are meeting your own
inner woman or your own inner man.</p><p>The third center is the navel. There the positive and the negative
meet – the positive electricity and the negative electricity. Their
meeting is even higher than life and death because the electric energy,
the <em>prana</em>, the bioplasma or bioenergy, is deeper than life and
death. It exists before life, it exists after death. Life and death
exist because of bioenergy. This meeting of bioenergy at the navel,
<em>nabhi</em>, gives you even a higher experience of being one:
integrated, a unity.</p><p>Then is the heart: at the heart center, the lower and the higher
meet. At the heart center: the <em>prakriti</em> and <em>purusha</em>,
the sexual and the spiritual, the worldly and the other-worldly – or you
can call it the meeting of heaven and earth. It is still higher because
for the first time something of the beyond dawns – you can</p><p>see the sun rising at the horizon. You are still rooted in the earth,
but your branches are spreading into the sky. You have become a meeting.
That’s why the heart center gives the highest and the most refined
experience ordinarily available – the experience of love. The experience
of love is the meeting of earth and heaven; so love is in a way earthly,
and in another way heavenly.</p><p>If Jesus defined God as love, this is the reason because in human
consciousness, love seems to be the higher glimpse.</p><p>Ordinarily people never go beyond the heart center. Even to reach to
the heart center seems to be difficult, almost impossible. People remain
at the sex center. If they are trained deeply in yoga, karate, aikido,
tai chi, then they reach to the second center, the hara. If they are
trained in a deep mechanism of breathing, <em>prana</em>, then they
reach the navel center. And if they are trained how to look beyond earth
and how to see beyond the body and how to look so deeply and so
sensitively that you are no longer confined to the gross, and the subtle
can penetrate its first rays into you – only then, the heart.</p><p>All paths of devotion – bhakti yoga – work on the heart center.
Tantra starts from the sex center, Tao starts from the hara center. Yoga
starts from the navel center. Bhakti yoga, paths of devotion and love,
Sufis and others, start from the heart center.</p><p>Higher than the heart is the throat center. Again there happens
another integration, even more superior, more subtle. This center is the
center of receiving and giving. When the child is born he receives from
the throat center. First, life enters him from the throat center – he
sucks air, breathes; and then he sucks milk from his mother. The child
functions from the throat center, but it is half functioning and soon he
forgets about it. He just receives, he cannot give yet; his love is
passive. And if you are asking for love, then you remain juvenile, you
remain childish. Unless you mature – so that you can give love – you
have not become a grown-up. Everybody asks for love, demands love, and
almost nobody gives. That’s the misery all over the world. And everybody
who demands thinks that he is giving, believes that he is giving.</p><p>I have looked into thousands of people – all hungry for love, thirsty
for love, but nobody in any way trying to give. And they all believe
that they are giving but not receiving. Once you give you naturally
receive. It has never happened otherwise. The moment you give, love
rushes into you. It has nothing to do with people; it has something to
do with the cosmic energy of existence.</p><p>The throat center is the meeting of receiving and giving. You receive
from it and you give from it. That is the meaning of Christ’s saying
that unless you become a child again…. If you translate it into the yoga
terminology it will mean: unless you come to the throat center again…
The child forgets by and</p><p>by.</p><p>If you look into Freudian psychology, you will have a parallel. Freud
says the first stage of the child is oral, the second stage is anal, and
the third stage is genital. The whole of Freudian psychology ends with
the third. Of course it is a very poor psychology, very rudimentary,
fragmentary, and concerned with the very lower functioning of human
beings. Oral – yes, the child uses the throat center, just to receive.
And once he has started receiving, his being moves to the anal.</p><p>Have you seen that a few people cling to the oral, even up to their
death? These are the people you will find smoking; these are oral
people. They still go on… The smoke, the cigarette, the cigar, gives
them a feeling as if something hot like mother’s milk is passing through
the throat center; they remain confined to the oral and they cannot
give. If a person is a chain-smoker, heavy smoker, almost always he is
not a giver of love. He demands, but he will not give.</p><p>People who are smoking too much are always interested in women’s
breasts – bound to be because a cigarette is a substitute for the
nipple. I am not saying that people who are not smokers are not
interested in women’s breasts. Those who smoke are interested; those who
don’t smoke are also interested – they may be chewing pan or gum or
something else, or they may be simply interested in pornography, or they
may be just obsessed by the breast continuously. In their mind, in their
dream, in their imagination, fantasy, the breast – breasts and breasts
go on floating all around them. These are oral people, stuck.</p><p>When Jesus says you have to be a child again, he means you have to
come back to the throat center, but with a new energy to give. All
creative people are givers. They may sing a song for you or dance a
dance or write a poem or paint a picture or tell you a story. For all
these, the throat center is again used as a center to give. The meeting
of receiving and giving happens at the throat. The capacity to receive
and to give is one of the greatest integrations.</p><p>There are people who are only capable of receiving. They will remain
miserable because you never become rich by receiving. You become rich by
giving. In fact, you possess only that which you can give. If you cannot
give it, you simply believe that you possess. You don’t possess it; you
are not a master. If you cannot give your money, then you are not the
master of it. Then money is the master. If you can give it, then
certainly you are the master. This will look like a paradox, but let me
repeat it: you are the possessor only of that which you give. The moment
you give, in that very moment you have become a possessor, enriched;
giving enriches you.</p><p>Miserly people are the most miserable and poor people in the world –
poorer than the poor. They cannot give: they are stuck. They go on
hoarding. Their hoarding becomes a burden on their being – it does not
free them. In fact, if you have something you will become freer. But
look at the misers. They have much, but they are burdened; they are not
free. Even beggars are freer than they. What has happened to them? They
have used their throat center just to receive. Not only have they not
used their throat center to give, they have not even moved to the second
Freudian center, anal. These people are always constipated; hoarders,
misers, always suffer from constipation. Remember, I am not saying that
all people who have constipation are misers; there may be other reasons.
But misers are certainly constipated.</p><p>Freud says that there is something in gold and excreta. Both look
yellow, and people who are constipatory are too attracted to gold.
Otherwise gold has no existential value – some psychological value, but
no existential value. You cannot eat it, you cannot drink it. What can
you do with it? Even a glass of water is more valuable existentially.
But why has gold become so valuable? Why are people so obsessed with
gold? They have not moved from the oral to the anal. They are
constipated in their inner being. Now their whole life will reflect
their constipation: they will become hoarders of gold. Gold is symbolic.
The yellowness gives them some idea.</p><p>Have you watched small children? It is difficult to persuade them to
go to the toilet, they have almost to be forced to go to the toilet. And
even then they insist, “Nothing is happening. Can I come back?” They are
learning the first lessons of miserliness – how to hold on. How to hold
on, how not to give even that which is useless, even that which is
harmful if you keep it within you. Even poison – it is difficult for
them to leave it, to renounce it.</p><p>I have heard about two Buddhist <em>bhikkhus</em>…</p><p><br></p><p>One of them was a miser and a hoarder and he used to collect money
and keep it, and the other used to laugh at this foolish attitude.
Whatsoever will come on his way, he will use it, he will never hoard it.
One night they came across a river. It was evening; the sun was setting
and it was dangerous to stay there. They had to go to the other shore.
There was a town; this side was simply wilderness.</p><p>The hoarder said, “Now you don’t have any money, so we cannot pay the
ferryman? What do you say now about it? You are against hoarding. Now if
I don’t have any money we both will die. You see the point?” He said,
“Money <em>is</em> needed.”</p><p>The man who believed in renunciation laughed, but he didn’t say
anything.</p><p>Then the hoarder paid and they crossed the river; they reached the
other shore.</p><p>The hoarder again said, “Now remember, next time don’t start arguing
with me. You see? Money helps. Without money we would have been dead.
The whole night on the other shore, it was dangerous to survive – wild
animals.”</p><p>The other <em>bhikkhu</em> laughed and he said, “But we have come
across the river because you could renounce it. It is not because of
hoarding that we have survived. If you had insisted on hoarding it and
you were not going to pay the ferryman, we would have died. It is
because you could renounce – because you could leave it, you could give
it – that’s why we have survived.”</p><p><br></p><p>The argument must be continuing still. But remember, I am not against
money. I am all for it, but use it! Possess it, own it; but your
ownership arises only the moment you have become capable of giving it.
At the throat center this new synthesis happens. You can accept and you
can give.</p><p>There are people who change from one extreme to another. First they
were incapable of giving, they could only receive; then they change,
they go to the other extreme – now they can give but they cannot
receive. That too is lopsidedness. A real man is capable of accepting
gifts and giving them back. In India you will find many sannyasins, many
so-called mahatmas, who will not touch money. If you give them any, they
will shrink back, as if you have produced a snake or something
poisonous. Their shrinking back shows that now they have moved to the
other extreme: now they have become incapable of receiving. Again their
throat center is half-functioning, and a center never functions really
unless it functions fully – unless the wheel moves all the way, goes on
moving and creates energy fields.</p><p>Then is the third-eye center: At the third-eye center the right and
left meet, <em>pingala</em> and <em>ida</em> meet, and become
<em>sushumna</em>. The two hemispheres of the brain meet at the third
eye: that is just between the two eyes. One eye represents the right,
another eye represents the left, and it is just in the middle. The left
and right brains meeting at the third eye is a very high synthesis.
People have been capable of describing up to this point. That’s why
Ramakrishna could describe up to the third eye. And when he started to
talk about the final, the ultimate synthesis that happens at
<em>sahasrar</em>, he again and again fell into silence, into
<em>samadhi</em>. He was drowned in it; it was too much. It was
floodlike; he was taken over to the ocean. He could not keep himself
conscious, alert.</p><p>The ultimate synthesis happens at <em>sahasrar</em>, the crown
chakra. Because of this <em>sahasrar</em>, all over the world kings,
emperors, monarchs, and queens, use the crown. It has become formal, but
basically it was accepted because unless</p><p>your <em>sahasrar</em> is functioning, how can you be a monarch, how
can you be a king? How can you rule people if you have not even become a
ruler of yourself? In the symbol of the crown a secret is hidden. The
secret is that a person who has reached to the crown center, the
ultimate synthesis of his being – only he should be the king or the
queen, nobody else. Only he is capable of ruling others, because he has
come to rule himself. He has become a master of himself; now he can be
helpful to others also.</p><p>Really, when you achieve to <em>sahasrar</em>, a crown flowers within
you, a one- thousand-petaled lotus opens. No crown can be compared with
it, but then it became just a symbol and the symbol has existed all over
the world. That simply shows that everywhere people became alert and
aware in one way or other of the ultimate synthesis in the
<em>sahasrar</em>. Jews use the skullcap – it is exactly on the
<em>sahasrar</em>. Hindus allow a bunch of hair, they call it
<em>choti</em>, the peak, to grow exactly on the spot where the
<em>sahasrar</em> is, or has to be. There are a few Christian societies
which shave just that part of the head. When a master blesses a
disciple, he puts his hand on the <em>sahasrar</em>. And if the disciple
is really receptive, surrendered, he will suddenly feel an upsurge of
energy, running from the sex center to the <em>sahasrar</em>.</p><p>Sometimes when I touch your head and you suddenly become sexual don’t
be afraid, don’t shrink back, because that is how it should be. The
energy is at the sex center. It starts uncoiling itself. You become
afraid, you shrink, you repress it – what is happening? And becoming
sexual at the feet of your master seems to be a little awkward,
embarrassing. It is not. Allow it, let it be, and soon you will see it
has passed the first center and the second and, if you are surrendered,
within a second the energy is moving at the <em>sahasrar</em> and you
will have a feeling of a new opening within you. That’s why a disciple
is supposed to bow his head, so the master can touch the head.</p><p>The last synthesis is of object and subject, the outer and inner,
again. In a sexual orgasm outer and inner meet, but momentarily. In
<em>sahasrar</em> they meet permanently. That’s why I say one has to
travel from sex to <em>samadhi</em>. In sex, ninety-nine percent is sex,
one percent is <em>sahasrar</em>; in <em>sahasrar</em>, ninety-nine
percent is <em>sahasrar</em>, one percent is sex. The two are joined,
they are bridged, by deep currents of energy. So if you have enjoyed
sex, don’t make your abode there. Sex is just a glimpse of
<em>sahasrar</em>. <em>Sahasrar</em> is going to deliver a thousandfold,
a millionfold, a bliss to you, benediction to you.</p><p>The outer and the inner meet, “I” and “thou” meet, man and woman
meet, yin and yang meet; and the meeting is absolute. Then there is no
parting, then there is no divorce.</p><p>This is called yoga. <em>Yoga</em> means the meeting of the two into
one. In</p><p>Christianity, mystics have called it <em>unio mystica</em>. That is
the exact translation of <em>yoga</em> – <em>unio mystica</em>: the
mysterious union. At the <em>sahasrar</em> the alpha and the omega meet,
the beginning and the end. The beginning is in the sex center, sex is
your alpha; <em>samadhi</em> is your omega. And unless alpha and omega
meet, unless you have attained to this supreme union, you will remain
miserable because your destiny is that. You will remain unfulfilled. You
can be fulfilled only at this highest peak of synthesis.</p><p>Now the sutras.</p><p>Performing samyama on their power of cognition, real nature, egoism,
all pervasiveness, and functions brings mastery over the sense
organs.</p><p>The first thing to be understood is that you have senses but you have
lost sensitivity. Your senses are almost dull, dead. They are there
hanging with you, but energy is not flowing in them; they are not alive
limbs of your being. Something has deadened within you, has become cold,
blocked. It has happened to the whole of humanity because of thousands
of years of repression. And thousands of years of conditioning and
ideologies which are against the body have crippled you. You live only
for name’s sake.</p><p>So the first thing to be done is: your senses should become really
alive and sensitive. Only then can they be mastered. You see but you
don’t see deeply. You see only the surface of things. You touch but your
touch has no warmth; nothing flows in and out from your touch. You hear
also. The birds go on singing and you hear and you can say, “Yes, I am
hearing,” and you are not wrong – you are hearing, but it never reaches
to the very core of your being. It does not go dancing within you; it
doesn’t help a flowering, an unfolding within you.</p><p>These senses have to be rejuvenated. Yoga is not against the body,
remember. Yoga says go beyond the body, but it is not against the body.
Yoga says use the body, don’t be used by it; but it is not against the
body. Yoga says the body is your temple. You are in the body, and the
body is so beautiful an organism, so complex and so subtle, so
mysterious, and so many dimensions open through it. And those are the
only doors and windows you will reach to existence through. So don’t
deaden them; make them more alive. Let them vibrate, pulsate, and, what
Stanley Keleman has said: “Let them ‘stream.’” That is exactly the right
word: let them flow like a stream, rushing. You can have the sensation.
Your hand, if it is rushing like a stream of energy: you will feel a
tingling sensation, you will feel something inside the hand is flowing
and wants to make contact, wants to be connected.</p><p>When you love a woman or a man and you take her hand in your hand, if
your hand is not streaming, this love is not going to be of any use. If
your hand is not jumping and throbbing with energy and pouring energy
into your woman or into your man, then this love is almost dead from the
very beginning. Then this child is not born alive. Then sooner or later
you will be finished – you are already finished. It will take a little
time to recognize because your mind is also dull; otherwise you would
not enter it because it is already dead. For what are you entering? You
take time to recognize things because your sensitivity, brilliance,
intelligence, is so clouded and confused.</p><p>Only a streaming love can become a source of blissfulness, of joy, of
delight. But for that you will need your senses streaming.</p><p>Sometimes you have that glimpse also; and everybody had it when he
was a child. Watch a child running after a butterfly. He is streaming,
as if any moment he can jump out of his body. Watch a child when he is
looking at a roseflower. See his eyes, the brilliance, the light that
comes to his eyes. He is streaming. His eyes are almost dancing on the
petals of the flower.</p><p>This is the way to be: be riverlike. And only then is it possible to
master these senses. In fact, people have had a very wrong attitude.
They think that if you want to master your senses, you have to make them
almost dead. But then what is the point of mastering? You can kill, and
you are the master. You can sit on the corpse. But what is the point of
being a master? But this looked easier: first kill them and then you can
master. If the body feels too strong, fast. Make it weak, and then you
start feeling that you are the master – but you have killed the body.
Remember, life has to be mastered, not dead things. They will not be of
any use.</p><p>But this has been found to be a shortcut, so all the religions of the
world have been using it. Destroy your body by and by. Disconnect
yourself from the body. Don’t be in contact, remove yourself, become
indifferent. When your body is almost a dead tree – no longer do leaves
come to it, no longer does it flower, no longer do birds come to rest.
It is just a dead stump. Of course you can master it, but now what are
you going to gain from this mastery?</p><p>This is the problem; that’s why people don’t understand what
Patanjali means.</p><p>Performing <span class=p>samyama</span>on their power of
cognition<span class=p>… Your eyes see, your ears hear, your nose
smells, your tongue tastes, your hands make contact, your feet make
connectedness with the earth – that is their power of
cognition.</span></p><p>Performing <span class=p>samyama</span>on their power of
cognition<span class=p>… But they have to be powerful. Otherwise you
will not be able to even feel what power is. These senses have to be so
full of power, so high with power, that you can perform</span></p><p>samyama<span class=p>, that you can meditate upon them.</span></p><p>Right now when you look at a flower, the flower is there, but have
you ever felt your eyes? You see the flower, but have you felt the power
of your eyes? It should be there because you are using your eyes to see
the flower. And of course, eyes are more beautiful than any flower
because all flowers have to come through the eyes. It is through the
eyes that you have become aware of the world of flowers, but have you
ever felt the power of the eyes? They are almost dull, dead. They have
become passive, just like windows, receptive. They don’t go to their
object.</p><p>And power means being active. Power means your eyes going and almost
touching the flower, your ears going and almost touching the songs of
the birds, your hands going with the total energy in you, focused there
and touching your beloved. Or you are lying down on the grass, and your
whole body, full of power, meeting in a contact with the grass, having a
dialogue with the grass. Or you are swimming in the river and whispering
with the river and listening to the whispers of the river – connected,
in communion – but power is needed.</p><p>So the first thing I would like you to do is when you see, really
see, become the eyes. Forget everything. Let your whole energy flow
through the eyes. Your eyes will be cleaned, bathed in an inner shower,
and you will be able to see that these trees are no longer the same, the
greenery is no longer the same. It has become greener, as if dust has
disappeared from it. The dust was not on the trees, it was on your eyes.
And you will see for the first time and you will hear for the first
time.</p><p>Jesus goes on saying to his disciples, “If you have ears listen. If
you have eyes see.” They were not all blind, and they were not all deaf.
What does he mean? He means that you have almost become deaf and almost
become blind. You see and yet you don’t see. You hear yet you don’t
hear. It is not a power, it is not energy, it is not vital.</p><p>Performing <span class=p>samyana</span>on their power of cognition,
real nature<span class=p>… Then you will be able to see what is the
real nature of your senses. It is divine. Your body embodies the divine.
It is the divine who has looked through your eyes.</span></p><p>I remember Meister Eckhart’s famous saying. The day he realized and
became enlightened, his friends and disciples and brothers asked, “What
have you seen?” He laughed. He is the only one in the whole of
Christianity who comes very close to Zen masters, almost a Zen master.
He laughed. He said, “I have not seen the divine. It has seen itself
through me. The divine has seen itself through me. These eyes are the
divine’s. And what a game, what a play. It has seen itself through
me.”</p><p>When you really feel the nature of your senses, you will feel it is
divine. It is existence who has moved through your hand. It is
existence’s hand. All hands are its. It is existence who has loved
through you. All love affairs are existence’s. And how can it be
otherwise? Hindus call it <em>leela</em> – a play. It is existence who
is calling you through the cuckoo, and it is existence who is listening
through you. It is it and it alone spread all over.</p><p>Performing samyama on their power of cognition, real nature, egoism,
all- pervasiveness, and functions brings mastery over the sense organs.
This word egoism has to be understood because in Sanskrit we have three
words for the ego and in English there is only one word. That creates
difficulty. The Sanskrit word in the sutra is asmita, so let me first
explain it to you.</p><p>There are three words: <em>ahankar</em>, <em>asmita</em>,
<em>atma</em>. All mean <em>I</em>. <em>Ahankar</em> can be translated
as the <em>ego</em> – the very gross, too much emphasis on “I.” For
<em>asmita</em> there is no word in English. <em>Asmita</em> means
amness. I am; in ego the emphasis is on “I”; in <em>asmita</em> the
emphasis is on “am.” Amness, purer than ego. Still it is there, but in a
very different form. Amness. And <em>atma</em>: even amness has
disappeared. In the ego “I am”; in <em>asmita</em> only “am”; in
<em>atma</em> even that has disappeared. In <em>atma</em> there is pure
being, neither I nor amness.</p><p>In this sutra, <em>asmita</em> is used, amness. Remember, the ego is
of the mind; senses have no ego. They have a certain amness but no ego.
The ego is of the mind. Your eyes don’t have any ego; your hands don’t
have any ego. They have a certain amness. That’s why if your skin has to
be replaced and somebody else’s skin is planted on you, your body will
reject it because the body knows “it is not mine.” So your own skin has
to be replaced from some other part of the body, from your thighs. Your
own skin has to be replaced, otherwise the body will reject. The body
will not accept it: “It is not mine.” The body has no I but it has an
amness.</p><p>If you need blood, anybody’s blood won’t do. The body will not accept
all sorts of blood, only a particular blood. It has its own amness. That
will be accepted; some other blood will be rejected. The body has its
own feel of its being – <em>very</em> unconscious, <em>very</em> subtle
and pure, but it is there.</p><p>Your eyes are yours, just like your thumbprints. Everything yours is
yours. Now physiologists say that everybody’s heart is different, of a
different shape. In physiology books, the picture that you will find is
not a real picture. It is just average. It is just imagined. Otherwise
each person’s heart has a different shape. Even each person’s kidney has
a different shape. These parts all have their signatures; everybody is
so unique. That is the amness.</p><p>You will never be here again, you have never been before, so move
cautiously and alertly and happily. Just think: the glory of your being.
Just</p><p>think: that you are so superb and unique. Existence has vested much
in you – never imitate because that will be a betrayal. Be yourself. Let
that be your religion. All else is politics. Don’t be a Hindu, don’t be
a Mohammedan, don’t be a Christian. Be religious, but there is only one
religion, and that is just being yourself, authentically yourself.</p><p>Performing samyama on their power of cognition, real nature, –
asmita, the subtle amness – all-pervasiveness, and functions brings
mastery over the sense organs. And if you meditate on these things, you
will become a master. Meditation brings mastery; nothing else brings
mastery except meditation. If you meditate on your eye, first you will
see the roseflower; by and by you will be able to see the eye that is
seeing. Then you have become a master of the eye. Once you have seen the
seeing eye, you have become a master. Now you can use all its energies;
and they are all-pervasive. Your eyes are not as limited as you think
them to be. They can see many more things which you have not seen. They
can penetrate many more mysteries that you have not even dreamed about.
But you are not master of your eyes, and you have used them in a very
haphazard way, not knowing what you are doing.</p><p>And in contact so much with objects, you have forgotten the
subjectivity of your eyes. It happens if you keep company with someone –
by and by you become influenced by him. You have been in contact with
objects too much and you have forgotten the inner quality of your
senses. You see things, but you never see your seeing. You hear the
songs, but you never hear the subtle vibration that goes on within you,
the sound of your being.</p><p>Let me tell you an anecdote…</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard that an extremely confident tramp had enormous nerve. He
had just completed a very large meal in a swanky restaurant when he
announced to the manager, “My good man, I have really enjoyed your food,
but unfortunately I cannot afford to pay for any of it at all. I have
not a penny to my name.</p><p>“Now don’t get angry. I am by profession a beggar, as you may see. I
happen to be an extremely talented beggar too. I can go out and within
one hour get the money I owe you for this meal. Naturally though, you
cannot trust me to come back, and this I fully understand. You would be
most welcome to accompany me, but can a man like you, a well-known
restaurant owner, afford to be seen with a man of my caliber? No. So I
have, sir, the perfect solution to our little problem. I will wait here
and you go out and beg until you have the cost of this meal.”</p><p>If you keep company with a beggar, you will become a beggar. He will
suggest in a thousand and one ways to you to become like him.</p><p>We have kept company with objects so long that we have forgotten our
subjectivity. We have remained focused outwardly so long on things that
we have forgotten that we are persons. This long association with
objects has completely destroyed your image of yourself. You have to
come back home.</p><p>In yoga, when you start seeing your seeing eye, you come across a
subtle energy. They call it <em>tanmatra</em>. When you can see your eye
seeing, just hidden behind the eyes you see a tremendous energy – that
is <em>tanmatra</em>, the energy of the eye. Behind the ear you see
tremendous energy accumulated, <em>tanmatra</em> of the ear. Behind your
genital organs you see tremendous energy accumulated, <em>tanmatra</em>
of sexuality. And so on, so forth. Everywhere behind your senses there
is a pool of energy, unused. Once you know it, you can pour that energy
into your eyes, and then you will see visions which only sometimes poets
see, painters see. Then you will hear sounds which only sometimes
musicians hear, poets hear. And then you will touch things which only
sometimes in rare moments lovers know how to touch.</p><p>You will become alive, streaming.</p><p>Ordinarily you have been taught to repress your senses, not to know
them. It is very foolish, but very convenient.</p><p>It happened…</p><p><br></p><p>After a rural wedding, the bride and the groom climbed into the wagon
and set out for their farm home. About a mile down the road, the horse
stumbled. “That’s one!” shouted the groom.</p><p>They continued on and the horse stumbled again. “That is two!”
shouted the groom.</p><p>As they neared the farm, the horse stumbled again. “That is three!”
shouted the groom and, seizing a gun from behind the seat, put a bullet
through the horse’s brain.</p><p>The bride sat aghast. Then, in no uncertain terms, she told her new
husband what she thought of his action. He sat quietly until she
subsided, then pointed at her and shouted, “That is one!”</p><p>The couple lived happily for sixty years.</p><p><br></p><p>But that happiness cannot be real happiness. Easy to repress at the
point of a gun, but then what sort of love will happen between these two
people? The gun will always stand in between, and the wife will always
be afraid that now any moment he is going to say, “Now this is two! Now
this is three!” and finished!</p><p>That’s what you have done with your senses, with your body – you have
repressed it. But you were helpless. I don’t say that you are
responsible for repressing it. You were brought up in such a way, nobody
allowed your senses freedom. In the name of love, only repression
continues. The mothers, the fathers, the society, they go on repressing.
By and by they teach you a trick, and the trick is not to accept
yourself, deny. Everything has to be channeled into conformity. Your
wilderness has to be thrown into the dark part of your soul and a small
corner has to be clean, like a drawing room, where you can see people,
meet people, and live and forget all about your wilder being: your real
existence. Your fathers and your mothers are not responsible either
because they were brought up in the same way.</p><p>So nobody is responsible. But once you know it, and you don’t do
anything, <em>then</em> you become responsible. Being near me I am going
to make you very, very responsible because you will know it, and then if
you don’t do anything, then you cannot throw the responsibility on
anybody else. Then you are going to be responsible!</p><p>Now you know about how you have destroyed your senses, and you know
also how to revive them. Do something. Throw the gun away completely,
the repressive mind completely. Unblock yourself. Start flowing again,
start connecting again with your being, start connecting with your
senses again. You are like a disconnected telephone line. Everything
looks perfectly okay, the telephone is there but the line is
disconnected. Your eyes are there, your hands are there, your ears are
there, but the line is disconnected. Reconnect it. If it can be
disconnected, it can be reconnected. Others have disconnected it because
they were also taught in the same way, but you can reconnect it.</p><p>All my meditations are to give you a streaming energy. That’s why I
call them dynamic methods. Old meditations were just to sit silently,
not to do anything. I give you active methods because when you are
streaming with energy you can sit silently, that will do, but right now
first you have to become alive.</p><p>From this follows instantaneous cognition without the use of the
body,</p><p>and complete mastery over pradhana, prakriti<em>,</em> the material
world.</p><p>If you can see <em>tanmatras</em>, the subtle energies of your
senses, you will become capable of using your cognition without the
grosser instruments. If you know that behind the eye there is an
accumulated pool of energy, you can close your eyes and use that energy
directly. Then you will be able to see without opening your eyes. That’s
what telepathy, clairvoyance, clairaudience is.</p><p>In Russia, there is a woman who has been investigated scientifically
who stands just twenty feet away from any object and starts pulling it,
just by energy. She makes movements with her hands, twenty feet away, as
you have seen a hypnotist making passes, she simply draws, gestures.
Within fifteen minutes, things start moving toward her. She has not
touched them. Much investigation has been done about what happens. And
that woman loses at least half a pound in weight in a half-hour
experiment. Certainly she is losing some sort of energy.</p><p>This is what yoga calls <em>tanmatra</em>. Ordinarily you use the
energy through the hand, when you pick something up: a stone, a rock.
You carry it; you use the same energy through the hand. But if you know
the energy directly, you can drop the use of the hand. The energy can
move the object directly. In the same way – telepathy: you can hear or
read people’s thoughts or can see faraway scenes. Once you know the
<em>tanmatra</em>, the subtle energy that is being used by your eyes,
the eyes can be discarded. Once you know that it is not really the sense
that is functioning but the energy, you are freed of the sense.</p><p>I have heard a story…</p><p><br></p><p>So this guy phoned Cohen & Goldberg, wholesalers. “Put me through
to Mr. Cohen, please.”</p><p>“I am afraid Mr. Cohen has gone out, sir,” said the switchboard girl.
“Then get me Mr. Goldberg.”</p><p>“I am afraid Mr. Goldberg is tied up at present, sir.” “Okay, I will
phone back later.”</p><p>Ten minutes later: “Mr. Goldberg, please.”</p><p>“I am afraid Mr. Goldberg is still tied up, sir.” “I will phone
back.”</p><p>Half an hour later: “Get me Mr. Goldberg.”</p><p>“I am terribly sorry, sir, but Mr. Goldberg is still tied up.” “I
will phone back.”</p><p>Another half an hour later: “Goldberg!”</p><p>“I have dreadful news for you, sir. Mr. Goldberg is still tied
up.”</p><p>“But look, this is ridiculous. How can you run a business like that?
One partner is out all morning and the other is tied up for hours on
end. What is going on there?”</p><p>“Well, you see, sir, whenever Mr. Cohen goes out, he ties up Mr.
Goldberg.”</p><p><br></p><p>This is what is happening inside you also. Whenever you go out,
through the eyes, through the hands, through your genital organs,
through your ears –</p><p>whenever you go out, continuously a certain type of bondage and tying
is created. By and by you become tight with the particular sense – eyes,
ears – because that is from where you go out, again, again, again. By
and by you forget the energy that is going out.</p><p>This getting into bondage with the senses is the whole world, the
samsara. How to untie yourself from the senses? And once you are tied up
with the senses, you start thinking in terms of them. You forget
yourself.</p><p>Another story…</p><p><br></p><p>A disciple wanted very much to renounce the world and follow his
guru, but he said that his wife and family loved him too much and he was
unable to leave his home.</p><p>The guru came up with a plan. The man was taught certain yogic
secrets so that he could give the appearance to all who looked upon his
body that he was deceased. The next day the man followed instructions
and his body was besieged with the wailings and sobbings of his wife and
family.</p><p>The guru appeared at the door in the guise of a magician and told the
family that if they loved this man so much, he could bring him back to
life. He said that the man would live if someone would die in his place
by drinking the potion he had.</p><p>Each member of the family had an excuse that made it necessary to
keep his own life, and the wife added, “Anyway, he is already dead; we
will manage.”</p><p>At this the yogi stood up and said, “Woman, if you can live without
me, then I can go with my guru.” He faced the teacher and said, “Let us
go, sir, Revered Master. I will follow you.”</p><p><br></p><p>The whole attachment to the senses is as if you <em>are</em> the
senses, as if you cannot live without them, as if your whole life is
confined to them. But you are not confined to them. You can renounce
them, and you can still live, and live on a higher plane. Difficult!
Just as if you want to persuade a seed, “Die, and soon a beautiful plant
will be born.” How can he believe, because he will be dead? No seed has
ever known that by his death a new sprout comes up, a new life arises.
So how to believe it? Or if you go near an egg and you want to persuade
the bird within, “Come out,” but how is the bird to believe that there
is any possibility of life without the egg? Or if you talk to a child
inside the womb of a mother and tell him, “Come out, don’t be afraid,”
but he knows nothing outside the womb. The womb has been his whole life;
he knows only that. He is afraid. The same is the situation: surrounded
by the senses, we live in a sort of confinement, an imprisonment.</p><p>One has to be a little daring, courageous. Right now, wherever you
are and whatsoever you are, nothing is happening to you. Then take the
risk. Then move into the unknown. Then try to find a new way of
life.</p><p>From this follows instantaneous cognition without the use of the
body, and complete mastery over <span class=p>prakriti</span>, the
material world. <span class=p>Up to now you have been possessed by the
material world. Once you know that you have your own energy, totally
independent from the material world, you become a master. No longer does
world possess you; you possess it. Only those who renounce become the
real masters.</span></p><p>Only after the awareness of the distinction between sattva and
purusha</p><p>does supremacy and knowledge arise over all states of existence.</p><p>And the subtlest discrimination has to be made between
<em>sattva</em> and <em>purusha</em> – intelligence and awareness. It is
very easy to separate yourself from the body. The body is so gross you
can feel it, you cannot be it. You must be inside it. It is easy to see
that you cannot be the eyes. You must be someone hidden behind who looks
through the eyes; otherwise who will look through the eyes? Your glasses
cannot look. Behind the glasses, eyes are needed. Your eyes are also
like glasses. They <em>are</em> glasses; they cannot look. You are
needed somewhere behind to look.</p><p>But the subtlest identification is with intelligence. Your power to
think, your power of intellect, understanding, is the subtlest thing. It
is very difficult to discriminate between awareness and intelligence.
But it can be discriminated.</p><p>By and by, step-by-step, first, know that you are not the body. Let
that understanding grow deep, crystallize. Then know that you are not
the senses. Let that understanding grow, crystallize. Then know that you
are not the <em>tanmatras</em>, the energy pools behind the senses. Let
that grow and crystallize. And then you will be able to see that
intelligence is also a pool of energy. It is the common pool, in which
eyes pour their energy, ears pour their energy, hands pour their energy.
All the senses are like rivers and intelligence is the central thing, in
which they bring information and pour.</p><p>Whatever your mind knows is given by the senses. You have seen
colors: your mind knows them. If you are color-blind, if you cannot see
the color green, then your mind does not know anything about green.</p><p><br></p><p>Bernard Shaw lived his whole life unaware that he was color-blind. It
is very difficult to come to know it, but one accidental incident
allowed him to become</p><p>aware. On one of his birthdays somebody presented him a suit, but the
tie was missing, so he went to the market to find a tie which could fit
with the suit. The suit was green, and he started purchasing a yellow
tie. His secretary was watching, and she asked, “What are you doing? It
won’t fit. The suit is green and the tie is yellow.”</p><p>He said, “Is there a difference between these two?”</p><p><br></p><p>For seventy years he had lived not knowing that he could not see
yellow. He saw green. Whether it was yellow or green, both colors looked
green. Yellow was not part of his mind; the eyes never poured that
information into the mind.</p><p>The eyes are like servants, information collectors, public relations
officers, roaming all over the world, collecting things, pouring into
the mind. They go on feeding the mind; the mind is the central pool.</p><p>First you have to become aware that you are not the eye, not the
energy that is hidden behind the eye, then you will be able to see that
every sense is pouring into the mind. You are not this mind, also. You
are the one who is seeing it being poured. You are just standing on the
bank, all the rivers pouring into the ocean – you are the watcher, the
witness.</p><p>Swami Ram has said: “Science is difficult to define, but perhaps the
most essential feature of it involves the study of something which is
external to the observer. The techniques of meditation offer an approach
which allows one to be external to one’s own internal states.”</p><p>“The techniques of meditation offer an approach which allows one to
be external to one’s own internal states” – and the ultimate of
meditation is to know that whatever you can know, you are not it.
Whatever can be reduced to a known object, you are not it, because you
cannot be reduced to an object. You remain eternally subject – the
knower, the knower, the knower. And the knower can never be reduced to
the known.</p><p>This is <em>purusha</em>, awareness. This is the final understanding
that arises out of yoga. Meditate over it.</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part12>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

It is empirical; it is a tool to work with – but still it has a philosophy. That too, is just to give an intellectual understanding of where you are moving, what you are seeking. But philosophy is arbitrary, utilitarian, just to give a comprehensive picture of the territory you are going to discover; but the philosophy has to be understood.\nThe first thing about Patanjali’s philosophy is that he divides human personality into five seeds, five bodies. He says you don’t have one body; you have layers upon layers of bodies – five layers.\nThe first body he calls annamay kosh – the food body, the earth body, which is made of earth and is constantly to be nourished by food. Food comes from the earth. If you stop taking food, your annamay kosh will wither away. So one has to be very alert to what one is eating because that makes you and it will affect you in millions of ways. Sooner or later your food is not just food – it becomes blood, your bones, your very marrow. It circulates in your being and goes on affecting you. So the purity of food creates a pure annamay kosh – the pure food body.\nAnd if the first body is pure, light, not heavy, then it is easy to enter the second body; otherwise it will be difficult, you will be loaded. Have you seen that when you have eaten too much, and heavy foods…? Immediately you start feeling a sort of sleep, a sort of lethargy. You would like to go to sleep; awareness immediately starts disappearing. When the first body is loaded it is difficult to create great awareness. Hence fasting became so important in all the religions. But fasting is a science and one should not fool around with it.\nJust the other night a sannyasin came and she told me that she has been fasting and now her whole body, her whole being, is disturbed – tremendously disturbed. Now the stomach is not functioning well, and when the stomach is not functioning well, everything is weakened, the vitality is lost, and you cannot be alive. You become more and more insensitive and dead.\nBut fasting is important. It should be done very carefully; one should understand the functioning of the annamay kosh – only then. And it should be done under the proper guidance of one who has moved through all the phases of his annamay kosh. Not only that, one who has gone beyond it and who can look at the annamay kosh as a witness; otherwise fasting can be dangerous. Then, just the right amount of food and the right quality of food has to be practiced; fasting is not needed.\nBut this is important because this is your first body and, more or less, people\ncling to their first body; they never move to the second. Millions of people are not even aware that they have a second body, a deeper body, hidden behind the first sheath. The first covering is very gross.\nThe second body Patanjali calls pranamay kosh – the energy body, electric body. The second consists of electric fields. That’s what acupuncture is all about. This second body is more subtle than the first, and people who start moving from the first body to the second become fields of energy, tremendously attractive, magnetic, hypnotic. If you go near them, you will feel vitalized, charged.\nIf you go near a man who lives only in his food body, you will be depleted – he will suck you. Many times you come across people and you feel that they suck you. After they have left, you feel depleted, dissipated, as if somebody has exploited your energy. The first body is a sucker, and the first body is very gross. So if you live too much with first body-oriented people, you will feel always burdened, tense, bored, sleepy, with no energy, always at the point of the lowest rung of your energy; and you will not have any energy which can be used for higher growth.\nThis type, the first type, the annamay-kosh oriented person lives for food. He eats and eats and eats, and that’s his whole life. He remains in a way childish. The first thing that the child does in the world is to suck air, and then to suck milk. The first thing the child has to do in the world is to help the food body, and if a person remains food addicted, he remains childish; his growth suffers.\nThe second body, pranamay kosh, gives you a new freedom, gives you more space. The second body is bigger than the first; it is not confined to your physical body. It is inside the physical body and it is outside the physical body; it surrounds you like a subtle climate, an aura of energy. Now in Russia they have discovered that photographs can be taken of this energy body. They call it “bioplasma,” but it exactly means prana – the energy, elan vital, or what Taoists call chi. It can be photographed; now it has become almost scientific.\nA very great discovery has been done in Russia, and that is that before your physical body suffers an illness the energy body suffers it – six months before – then it happens to the physical body. If you are going to have tuberculosis, or cancer, or any illness, your energy body starts showing indications of it six months before. No examination, no testing of the physical body shows anything, but the electric body starts showing it. First it appears in the pranamay kosh, then it enters the annamay kosh.\nSo now they say that it has become possible to treat a person before he has fallen ill. Once it becomes so, then there is no need for humanity to fall ill.\nBefore you become aware that you are ill, your photographs by Kirlian methods will show that some illness is going to happen to your physical body; it can be prevented in the pranamay kosh.\nThat’s why yoga insists so much on the purity of breathing, because the pranamay kosh is made of a subtle energy that travels with the breathing, inside you. If you breathe rightly, your pranamay kosh remains healthy and whole and alive. Such a person never feels tired; such a person is always available to do anything. Such a person is always responsive, always ready to respond to the moment, ready to take the challenge. He is always ready. You will never find him unprepared for any moment. Not that he plans for the future, no – but he has so much energy that whatsoever happens he is ready to respond. He has overflowing energy. Tai chi works on pranamay kosh. Pranayam works on pranamay kosh.\nIf you know just how to breathe naturally, you will grow into your second body. And the second body is stronger than the first. And the second body lives longer than the first.\nWhen somebody dies, for almost three days you can see his bioplasma. Sometimes that is mistaken for his ghost. The physical body dies, but the energy body continues to move. And those who have experimented deeply about death say that for three days it is very difficult for the person who has died to believe that he has died, because the same form – and more vital than ever, more healthy than ever, more beautiful than ever – surrounds him. It depends on how big a bioplasma you have; then it can continue for thirteen days or even for more.\nAround the samadhis of yogis – in India we burn everybody’s body except the body of one who has attained to Samadhi; we don’t burn his body for a certain reason. Once you burn the body, the bioplasma starts moving away from the earth. You can feel it for a few days, but then it disappears into the cosmos. But if the physical body is left, then the bioplasma can cling to it. And a man who has attained samadhi, who has become enlightened, if his bioplasma can remain somewhere around his samadhi, many people will be benefited by it. That’s how many people come to see their gurus’ forms.\nIn the Aurobindo ashram, Aurobindo’s body is put in a samadhi, not destroyed, not burned. Many people have felt as if they have seen Aurobindo around it. Or sometimes they have heard the same footsteps, the way Aurobindo used to walk, and sometimes he is there just standing before them. This is not Aurobindo. This is the bioplasma. Aurobindo is gone, but the bioplasma, the pranamay kosh, can persist for centuries. If the person has been really in tune with his pranamay kosh, it can persist. It can have its own\nexistence.\nNatural breathing has to be understood. Watch small children – they breathe naturally. That’s why small children are so full of energy; the parents are tired, but they are not tired.\nOne child was saying to another child, “I am so full of energy that I wear out my shoes within seven days.”\nAnother said, “That’s nothing. I am so full of energy I wear out my clothes within three days.”\nThe third said, “That too is nothing. I am so full of energy I wear out my parents within one hour.”\nIn America they have done an experiment: one very powerful man – an athletic body with tremendous energy – was told to follow a small child and imitate. Whatsoever the child does, this athlete has to do; just imitate for eight hours. Within four hours the athlete was gone, flat on the floor, because the child enjoyed it very much and he started doing many things – jumping, jogging, shouting, yelling. And the athlete has just to repeat… The child was perfectly full of energy after four hours; the athlete was gone. He said, “He will kill me. Eight hours! Finished! I cannot do anything more.” He was a great boxer, but boxing is one thing. You cannot compete with a child.\nFrom where does the energy come? It comes from pranamay kosh. A child breathes naturally, and of course breathes more prana in, more chi in and accumulates it in his belly. The belly is the accumulating place, the reservoir. Watch a child; that is the right way to breathe. When a child breathes, his chest is completely unaffected. His belly goes up and down. He breathes as if from the belly. All children have a little belly; that belly is there because of their breathing and the reservoir of energy.\nThat is the right way to breathe; remember not to use your chest too much. Sometimes it can be used, in emergency periods – you are running to save your life – then the chest can be used. It is an emergency device; then you can use shallow, fast breathing, and run. But ordinarily the chest should not be used. And one thing to be remembered: because the chest is meant only for emergency situations, because it is difficult in an emergency situation to breathe naturally – if you breathe naturally you remain so calm and quiet you cannot run, you cannot fight, you are so calm and collected you are buddhalike… And in an emergency – the house is on fire – if you breathe naturally, you will not be able to save anything. Or if a tiger jumps upon you in a forest and you go on breathing naturally you will not be bothered. You will\nsay, “Okay, let him do whatsoever he wants.” You will not be able to protect yourself.\nSo nature has given an emergency device; the chest is an emergency device. When a tiger attacks you, you have to drop natural breathing and you have to breathe by the chest. Then you will have more capacity to run, to fight, to burn energy fast. And in an emergency situation there are only two alternatives – flight or fight. Both need a very shallow but intense energy – shallow but a very disturbed, tense state.\nNow if you continuously breathe from the chest, you will have tensions in your mind. If you continuously breathe from the chest, you will always be afraid because the chest breathing is meant only in fearful situations. And if you have made it a habit then you will be continuously afraid, tense, always in flight. The enemy is not there, but you will imagine the enemy is there; that’s how paranoia is created.\nIn the West also, a few people have come across this phenomenon – Alexander Lowen and other bioenergetic people who have been working on bioenergy. That is prana. They have come to feel that in people who are afraid, the chest is tense and they are breathing very shallow breaths. If their breathing can be made deeper, to go and touch the belly, the hara center, then their fear disappears. If their musculature can be relaxed, as is done in Rolfing… Ida Rolf has invented one of the most beautiful methods to change the inner structure of the body because if you have been breathing wrongly for many years, you have developed a musculature, and that musculature will be in the way and will not allow you to rightly breathe or deeply breathe. And even if you remember for a few seconds and breathe deeply – again when you are engaged in your work you will start shallow-chest breathing. The musculature has to be changed. Once the musculature is changed, the fear disappears and the tension disappears. Rolfing is tremendously helpful; but also working on pranamay kosh, the second bioplasma body, bioenergy body, chi body, or whatsoever you want to call it.\nWatch a child; that is natural breathing and breathe that way. Let your belly come up when you inhale, let your belly go down when you exhale. And let it be in such a rhythm it becomes almost a song in your energy, a dance – with rhythm, with harmony – and you will feel so relaxed, so alive, so vital that you cannot imagine that such vitality is possible.\nThen is the third body, manomay kosh – the mental body. The third is bigger than the second, subtler than the second, higher than the second. Animals have the second body but not the third. Animals are so vital: see a lion walking – what beauty, what grace, what grandeur! Man has always felt jealous. See a\ndeer running – what weightlessness, what energy, what a great energy phenomenon! Man has always felt jealous, but man’s energy is moving higher.\nThe third body is manomay kosh, the mental body. This is bigger, more spacious than the second. And if you don’t grow it, you will remain just a possibility of man but not a real man. The word man comes from man, manomay. The English word also comes from the Sanskrit root man. The Hindi word for man is manushya; that too comes from the same root man, the mind. It is mind that makes you man, but more or less you don’t have it. What you have in its place is just a conditioned mechanism. You live by imitation: then you don’t have a mind. When you start living on your own – spontaneous – when you start answering your life problems on your own, when you become responsible, you start growing in manomay kosh. Then the mind-body grows.\nOrdinarily if you are a Hindu or a Mohammedan or a Christian you have a borrowed mind; it is not your mind. Maybe Christ attained to a great explosion of manomay kosh and then people have been simply repeating it. That repetition will not become a growth in you. That repetition will be a hindrance. Don’t repeat: rather try to understand. Become more and more alive, authentic, responsive. Even if there is a possibility to go astray, go astray. Because there is no way to grow if you are so afraid of committing errors. Errors are good; mistakes have to be committed. Never commit the same mistake again, but never be afraid of committing mistakes. People who become so afraid of committing mistakes never grow. They go on sitting in their place, afraid to move. They are not alive.\nThe mind grows when you face, encounter, situations on your own. You bring your own energy to solve them. Don’t go asking for advice forever. Take the reins of your life in your own hands; that’s what I mean when I say do your thing. You will be in trouble – it is safer to follow others, it is convenient to follow the society, to follow the routine, the tradition, the scripture. It is very easy because everybody is following – you have just to become a dead part of the herd, you have just to move with the crowd wherever it is going; it is none of your responsibility. But your mental body, your manomay kosh, will suffer tremendously, terribly; it will not grow. You will not have your own mind, and you will miss something very, very beautiful and something which functions as a bridge for higher growth.\nSo always remember, whatsoever I say to you, you can take it in two ways. You can simply take it on my authority: “Osho says so, it must be true” – then you will suffer, then you will not grow. Whatsoever I say, listen to it, try to understand it, implement it in your life, see how it works, and then come to your own conclusions. They may be the same, they may not be. They can never\nbe exactly the same because you have a different personality, a unique being. Whatsoever I am saying is my own. It is bound to be in deep ways rooted in me. You may come to similar conclusions, but they cannot be exactly the same. So my conclusions should not be made your conclusions. You should try to understand me, you should try to learn, but you should not collect knowledge from me, you should not collect conclusions from me. Then your mind-body will grow.\nBut people take shortcuts. They say, “If you have known, finished. What is the need for us to try and experiment? We will believe in you.” A believer has no manomay kosh. He has a false manomay kosh which has not come out of his own being but has been forced from without.\nThen higher than manomay kosh, bigger than manomay kosh, is vigyanamay kosh – it is the intuitive body. It is very, very spacious. Now there is no reason in it; it goes beyond reason, has become very, very subtle. It is an intuitive grasp. It is a seeing directly into the nature of things. It is not trying to think about it.\nThe cypress tree in the courtyard: you just look at it. You don’t think about it; there is no “about” in intuition. You simply become available, receptive, and reality reveals to you its nature. You don’t project. You are not searching for any argument, for any conclusion, nothing whatsoever. You are not even searching. You are simply waiting, and reality reveals – it is a revelation. The intuitive body takes you to very far out horizons, but still there is one body more.\nThat is the fifth body, anandmay kosh – the bliss body. That is really far out!\nIt is made of pure bliss. Even intuition is transcended.\nThese five seeds are just seeds, remember. Beyond these five is your reality. These are just seeds surrounding you: the first is very gross; you are almost confined in a six-foot body. The second is bigger than it, the third still bigger, the fourth still bigger, the fifth is very big; but still these are seeds. All are limited. If all the seeds are dropped and you stand nude in your reality, then you are infinite. That’s what yoga says: you are godly – aham brahmasmi. You are the very brahman. Now you are ultimate reality itself; now all barriers are dropped.\nTry to understand this. The barriers are there surrounding you in circles. The first barrier is very, very hard. To get out of it is very difficult. People remain confined to their physical bodies and they think their physical life is all that there is to life.\nDon’t settle… The physical body is just a step to the energy body. The energy body is again just a step for the mind body. That too in its own, just a\nstep for the intuitive body. That too, a step for the bliss body. And from bliss you take the jump – now there are no more steps – you take the jump into the abyss of your being that is infinity, eternity.\nThese are five seeds.\nCorresponding to these five seeds, yoga has another doctrine about five bhutas, five great elements. Just as your body is made of food, earth; the earth is the first element. It has nothing to do with this earth, remember. The element simply says wherever there is matter it is earth; the material is the earth, the gross is the earth. In you it is the body; outside you it is the body of all. The stars are made of earth. Everything that exists is made of earth. The first shell is of earth. Five bhutas means five great elements: earth, fire, water, air, ether.\nEarth corresponds to your first, annamay kosh, the food body. Fire corresponds to your second body, energy body, bioplasma, chi, pranamay kosh; it has the quality of fire. Third is water. It corresponds to the third, manomay body, the mental body; it has the quality of water. Watch the mind, how it goes on like a flux, always moving, moving riverlike. The fourth is air, almost invisible; you cannot see it but it is there. You can only feel it. That corresponds to the intuitive body, vigyanamay kosh. And then there is akash, ether; you cannot even feel it. It has become even more subtle than air. You can simply believe it, trust it that it is there. It is pure space; that is bliss.\nBut you are purer than pure space, subtler than pure space. Your reality is almost as if it is not. That’s why Buddha says anatta – no-self. Your self is like a no-self; your being is almost like a nonbeing. Why nonbeing? Because it has gone so far away from all gross elements. It is pure is-ness. Nothing can be said about it, no description will be adequate for it.\nThese are five bhutas, five great elements, corresponding to five koshs, bodies, within you.\nThen the third doctrine – I would like you to understand all these because they will be helpful in understanding the sutras that we will be discussing now. Then there are seven chakras. The word chakra does not really mean center; the word center cannot explain it or describe it or translate it rightly because when we say “the center,” it seems something static. And chakra means something dynamic. The word chakra means “the wheel,” the moving wheel. So a chakra is a dynamic center in your being, almost like a whirlpool, whirlwind, the center of the cyclone. It is dynamic; it creates an energy field around it.\nSeven chakras. The first is a bridge and the last is also a bridge; the remaining five correspond to five mahabhutas, the great elements and the five seeds. Sex is a bridge, a bridge between you and the grossest – the prakriti,\nnature. Sahasrar, the seventh chakra is also a bridge, a bridge between you and the abyss – the ultimate. These two are bridges. The remaining five centers correspond to five elements and five bodies.\nThis is the framework of Patanjali’s system. Remember it is arbitrary. It has to be used as a tool, not discussed as a dogma. It is not a doctrine in any theology. It is just a utilitarian map. You go to some territory, to some strange country, unknown, and you take a map with you. The map does not really represent the territory; how can the map represent the territory? The map is so small, the territory is so big. On the map, cities are just points. How can those points correspond to big cities? On the map, roads are just lines. How can roads be just lines? Mountains are just marked, rivers are just marked – and small ones are left out. Only big ones are marked. This is a map; it is not a doctrine.\nThere are not only five bodies, there are many bodies because between two bodies there is another to join it, and so on and so forth. You are like an onion, layers upon layers, but these five will do. These are the main bodies, the chief ones. So don’t be too worried about it – because Buddhists say there are seven bodies, and Jainas say there are nine bodies. Nothing wrong and there is no contradiction because these are just maps. If you are studying the whole world’s map, then even big cities disappear, even big rivers disappear. If you are studying a map of a nation, then many new things appear which were not on the world map. And if you are studying the map of a province, then many more things appear. And if you are studying the map of a district, of course many more. And if just of one city, then many more, and if just of one house, then of course things go on appearing, it depends.\nJainas say nine. Buddha says seven. Patanjali says five. There are schools which say only three. And they all are true because they are not discussing any argument, they are just giving you a few tools to work with.\nAnd I think five is almost perfect because more than five is too much, less than five is too few. Five seems almost perfect, and Patanjali is a very balanced thinker.\nNow a few things about these chakras: The first chakra, the first dynamic center, is sex – muladhar. It joins you with nature, it joins you with the past, it joins you with the future. You were born out of two persons’ sexual play. Your parents’ sexual play became the cause of your birth. You are related to your parents through the sex center, and to your parents’ parents and so on and so forth. You are related to the whole past through the sex center. The thread runs through the sex center and if you give birth to a child, you will be related to the future.\nJesus insists many times, in a very rude way, “If you don’t hate your mother\nand your father, you cannot come and follow me.” It looks almost hard, almost unbelievable that a man like Jesus… Why should he use such hard words? And he is compassion incarnate, and he is love. Why does he say, “Hate your mother, hate your father if you want to follow me”? The meaning is: drop out of the sexual context. What he is saying symbolically is go beyond the sex center, then immediately you are no longer related with the past, no longer related with the future.\nIt is sex that makes you part of time. Once you go beyond sex, you become part of eternity, not of time. Then suddenly only the present exists. You are the present but if you see yourself through the sex center, you are the past also because your eyes will have the color of your mother and your father, and your body will have atoms and cells from millions of generations. Your whole structure, biostructure, is part of a long continuum. You are part of a big chain.\nIn India, they say your debt to your parents cannot be fulfilled unless you give birth to children. If you want that your debt should be fulfilled with the past, you have to create the future. If you really want to repay, there is no other way. Your mother loved you, your father loved you – what can you do now they are gone? You can become a mother, a father to children and repay it to nature – to the same reservoir from where your parents came, you came, your children will come.\nSex is the great chain. It is the whole chain of the world, samsara, and it is the link with others. Have you watched it? The moment you feel sexual you start thinking of the other; when you are not feeling sexual you never think of the other. A person who is beyond sex is beyond others. He may live in the society, but he is not in the society. He may be walking in the crowd, but he walks alone. And a man who is sexual may be sitting on the top of Everest, alone, but he will think of the other. He may be sent to the moon to meditate, but he will meditate about the other.\nSex is the bridge with the others. Once sex disappears the chain is broken. For the first time you become an individual. That’s why people may be too obsessed with sex, but they are never happy with it because it is double-edged. It links you with others, it does not allow you to be individual. It does not allow you to be yourself. It forces you into patterns, into slaveries, bondages. But if you don’t know how to transcend it, that’s the only way to use your energy – it becomes a safety valve.\nPeople who live at the first center, muladhar, live only for a very foolish reason. They go on creating energy and then they are too burdened with it. Then they go on throwing it away. They eat, they work, they sleep, they do many things to create energy. Then they say, “What to do with it? It is very\nheavy.” Then they throw it – seems a very vicious circle! When they throw it away, they again feel empty. They fill with new fuel, with new food, with new work, and again when the energy is there they are “feeling too full,” they say. Somewhere it has to be released. And sex becomes just a release: a vicious circle of accumulating energy, throwing energy, accumulating energy, throwing energy. It looks almost absurd.\nUnless you know that there are higher centers within you that can take that energy – use it in a creative way – you will remain confined to the sexual vicious circle. That’s why all the religions insist on some sort of sexual control. It can become repressive, it can become dangerous. If new centers are not opening and you go on damming energy, condemning, forcing, repressing, then you are on a volcano. Any day you will explode; you will become neurotic. You are going to be mad. Then it is better to relieve it. But there are centers which can absorb the energy, and greater being and greater possibilities can be revealed to you.\nRemember, we have been saying in the past few days that the second center, near the sex center, is the hara, the center of death. That’s why people are afraid to move beyond sex because the moment the energy moves beyond sex it touches the hara center and one becomes afraid. That’s why people are even afraid to move deeply in love because when you move deeply into love, the sex center creates such ripples that the ripples enter the hara center and fear arises.\nSo many people come to me and they say, “Why do we feel so afraid of the other sex?” – of men or women – “Why do we feel so afraid?” It is not the fear of the other sex, it is the fear of sex itself because if you go deeply into sex, then the center becomes more dynamic, creates bigger energy fields and those energy fields start overlapping with the hara center. Have you watched? In a sexual orgasm something starts moving just below your navel, throbbing. That throb is the overlapping of the sex center with the hara. That’s why people become afraid of sex also. Particularly people become afraid of deep intimacy, of orgasm itself.\nBut that second center has to be entered, penetrated, opened. That’s the meaning when Jesus says unless you are ready to die, you cannot be reborn.\nJust a few days ago, on Easter, somebody has asked a question, “Today is Easter, have you something to say?” I have only one thing to say, that each day is Easter because Easter is the day of Jesus’ resurrection – his crucifixion and resurrection, his death and his being reborn. Each day is an Easter if you are ready to move into the hara center. You will be crucified first – the cross is there within your hara center. You are already carrying it; you just have to move to it and you have to die through it, and then there is resurrection.\nOnce you die in the hara center, death disappears; then for the first time you become aware of a new world, a new dimension. Then you can see the center higher than the hara; that is the navel center. And the navel center becomes the resurrection because it is the most energy-conserving center. It is the very reservoir of energy.\nAnd once you know that you have moved from the sex center to the hara, now you know that there is a possibility of moving inward. You have opened one door. Now you cannot rest unless you have opened all the doors. Now you cannot remain on the porch; you have entered the palace. Then you can open another door and another door…\nJust in the middle is the heart center. The heart center divides the lower and the higher. First is the sex center, then the hara, then the navel, and then comes the heart center. Three centers are below it, three centers are above it: The heart is exactly in the middle.\nYou must have seen Solomon’s seal. In Judaism, particularly in Cabalistic thinking, Solomon’s seal is one of the most important symbols. That Solomon’s seal is the symbol of the heart center. Sex moves downward, so sex is like a triangle pointed downward. Sahasrar moves upward, so sahasrar is a triangle moving upward, pointed upward. And the heart is just in the middle, where the sex triangle comes to meet the sahasrar triangle. Both triangles meet, merge into each other, and it becomes a six-pointed star, that is the seal of Solomon. The heart is the seal of Solomon.\nOnce you have opened the heart, then you are available for the highest possibilities. Below the heart you remain man; beyond the heart you have become superman.\nAfter the heart center there is the throat center, then there is the third-eye center, and then sahasrar.\nThe heart is feeling love. The heart is absorbing love, becoming love. The throat is expression, communication, sharing, giving it to others. And if you give love to others, then the third-eye center starts functioning. Once you start giving, you go higher and higher. A person who goes on taking goes lower and lower and lower. A person who goes on giving goes higher and higher and higher. A miser is the worst possibility a man can fall into, and a sharer is the greatest possibility that a man can become available to.\nFive bodies, five mahabhutas, and five centers, plus two bridges; this is the framework, the map. Behind this framework is the whole effort of the yogi, of bringing samyama to every nook and corner, so one becomes enlightened, full of light.\nNow the sutras of Patanjali – he says:\nThe power of contacting the state of consciousness which is outside the mental body, manomay sharir, and therefore inconceivable\nis called mahavideha.\nThrough this power\nthe covering of the light is destroyed.\nOnce you are beyond the mind-body, for the first time you become aware that you are not the mind but the witness. Below the mind you remain identified with it. Once you know that thoughts, mental images, ideas, are just objects, floating clouds in your consciousness – you are separate from them immediately.\nThe power of contacting the state of consciousness which is outside the mental body and therefore inconceivable is called mahavideha. You become beyond body. Mahavideha means one who is beyond body, one who is no longer confined to any body, one who knows that he is not the body, gross or subtle, one who knows that he is infinite, with no boundaries. Mahavideha means one who has come to feel that he has no boundaries. All boundaries are confinements, imprisonments; and he can break them, drop them, and he can become one with the infinite sky.\nThis moment of realizing oneself as the infinite is the moment: through this power the covering of the light is destroyed. Then the covering is dropped which has been hiding your light. You are like a light which is being hidden under covers and covers, by and by each and every cover has to be taken away; more light will penetrate out of it.\nManomay kosh, the mental body, once dropped you become meditation, you become a no-mind. All our effort here is how to go beyond themanomay kosh – how to become aware: “I am not the thinking process.”\nPerforming samyama on their gross, constant, subtle, all-pervading, and functional state brings mastery over the panchabhutas –\nthe five elements.\nThis is one of the most potential sutras of Patanjali, and very significant for future science. One day or other, science is going to discover the meaning of this sutra.\nScience is already on the path toward it. This sutra says that all the elements in the world, the pancha mahabhutas – earth, air, fire, etcetera – they come out of nothing, and they go again into nothingness to rest. Everything comes out of nothing and when tired, goes back and rests into nothingness.\nNow science, particularly physicists, agree with it: that matter has come out\nof nothing. The deeper they have gone into matter, the more they have discovered that there is nothing like the material. The deeper they go, matter becomes more and more elusive and finally it slips out of their fingers. Nothing remains, just emptiness, just pure space. Out of pure space everything is born. Looks very illogical – but life is illogical. The whole of modern science has become illogical because if you persist in your logic, you cannot move into reality. If you move into reality you have to drop logic. And of course when there is a choice between logic and reality, how can you choose logic? You have to drop logic.\nJust fifty years ago, scientists came to realize that quanta, electric particles, behave in a very ridiculous way, behave like a Zen master – unbelievable, absurd – sometimes they look like waves and sometimes they look like particles. Now before that it was a tacit understanding that something can be either a particle or a wave. One and the same thing cannot be both together, simultaneously. A particle and a wave? It means something can be a point and a line together, at the same time. Impossible! Euclid will not agree. Aristotle will simply deny – you have gone mad. A point is a point, and a line is many points in a row, so how can one point be a line also at the same time remaining a point? Looks absurd – and Euclid and Aristotle prevailed.\nJust fifty years before, their whole edifice collapsed because scientists came to know that the quantum, the electric particle, behaves in both ways simultaneously.\nLogicians raised arguments, and they said, “This is not possible.” Physicists said, “What can we do? It is not a question of possibility or impossibility. It is so! We cannot do anything. If the quantum is not going to follow Aristotle, what can we do? And if the quantum behaves in a non-Euclidean way and does not follow the geometry of Euclid, what can we do? We have to listen to the behavior of the real and the reality.”\nThis is one of the very critical moments in the history of human consciousness. It has always been believed that something can come only out of something. Simple and natural, obviously so. How can something come out of nothing? Then matter disappeared, and the scientists have to conclude that everything is born out of nothing, and everything disappears again into nothing. Now they are talking about black holes. Black holes are holes of tremendous nothingness. I have to call it “tremendous nothingness” because that nothingness is not just an absence. It is full of energy, but the energy is of nothingness. There is nothing to find, but there is energy.\nNow they say there exist black holes in existence. They are parallel to stars – stars are positive, and parallel to each star there is a black hole. The star is;\nthe black hole is not. Each star when burned, exhausted, becomes a black hole. And each black hole, when rested, becomes a star.\nMatter, no-matter go on changing. Matter becomes no-matter; no-matter becomes matter. Life becomes death; death becomes life. Love becomes hate; hate becomes love. Polarities continuously change.\nThis sutra says, Performing samyama on their gross, constant, subtle, all- pervading, and functional state brings mastery over the panchabhutas – the five elements. Patanjali is saying that if you have come to understand your true nature of witnessing, and then if you concentrate – you bring samyama on any matter – you can make it appear or disappear. You can help things to materialize because they come out of nothingness. And you can help things to dematerialize.\nNow, that yet remains to be seen by physicists, whether it is possible or not. It is happening that matter changes and becomes no-matter, no-matter changes, becomes matter. They have come to feel many absurd things these fifty years. It is one of the most potential ages ever, where so many things have exploded that it has become almost impossible to confine them in a system. How to make a system? It was very easy just fifty years earlier to create a self-contained system and now it is impossible. Reality has poked its nose from everywhere and destroyed all doctrinaires, systems, dogmas. Reality has proved to be too much.\nScientists say it is happening. Patanjali says it can be made to happen. If it is happening, then why can it not be made to happen? Just watch. You heat water; at a hundred degrees it becomes vapor. It has always been happening, before fire was ever discovered. The sun rays were evaporating water from the seas and rivers, and clouds were forming and water was coming back again into the rivers, again evaporating. Then man discovered fire, and then he started heating water, evaporating it.\nWhatever is happening, ways and means can be found to make it happen. If it is already happening then it is not against reality, then you have just to know how to make it happen. If matter becomes no-matter, no-matter becomes matter, if things change polarities, things disappear into nothingness and things appear out of nothingness – if this is already happening – then Patanjali says ways and means can be found through which it can be made to happen. And this he says is the way: if you have come to recognize your being, beyond the five seeds, you become capable of materializing things or dematerializing things.\nIt still remains for the scientific workers to find out whether it is possible or not, but it seems plausible. There seems to be no logical problem in it.\nFrom this follows the attainment of anima, etcetera,\nPerfection of the body, and\nthe removal of the elements’ power to obstruct the body.\nAnd then come the eight siddhis, eight powers of yogis. The first is anima, and then there is laghima and garima, etcetera. The eight powers of the yogi are that they can make their body disappear, or they can make their body so small, so small that it becomes almost invisible, or they can make their bodies so big, as big as they want. It is under their control to make the body small, big, or disappear completely, or to appear in many places simultaneously.\nLooks impossible, but things that look impossible by and by become possible. It was impossible for man to fly; nobody ever believed – the Wright brothers were thought to be mad, insane. When they invented their first airplane, they were so afraid to tell people – that if people come to know, they would be caught and hospitalized. The first flight was done completely unknown to anybody, just these two brothers. And they invented their first airplane hiding in a basement, so nobody came to know what they were doing. Everybody had believed that they had gone completely mad – who has ever flown? Their first air flight was of sixty seconds only – only of sixty seconds – but it changed the whole of history tremendously, the whole of humanity. It became possible.\nNobody had ever thought that the atom could be split. It was split, and now man can never be the same again.\nMany things have happened which were always thought to be impossible. We have reached the moon; it was the symbol of impossibility. In all the languages of the world there are expressions like, “Don’t long for the moon.” That means don’t long for the impossible. Now we have to change those expressions. And in fact, once we have reached the moon, now nothing debars the path. Now everything has become available; it is only a question of time.\nEinstein has said that if we can invent a vehicle which moves with the speed of light, then a person can go on traveling and he will never age. If he goes on a spaceship that moves with the speed of light when he is thirty years old, and comes back after thirty years, he will remain thirty years old. His friends and brothers will be sixty years old, a few of them will be already dead, but the person will remain thirty years old. What nonsense are you saying? Einstein says time and its effect disappear when one is moving with the speed of light. A man can go on infinite space travel and can come back after five hundred years. All the people here will be gone, nobody will recognize him and he will not recognize anybody, but he will remain the same age. You are aging because of the speed of the earth. If the speed is as much as light, which is really\ntremendous, then you will not age at all.\nPatanjali says that if you have moved beyond all the five bodies, you have gone beyond all five elements. Now you are in a state from where you can control anything you wish. Just by the idea that you want to become small, you will become small; if you want to become big, you will become big; if you want to disappear, you can disappear.\nIt is not necessarily that yogis should do it. Buddhas have never been known to do it. Patanjali himself has not been known to do it. What Patanjali is saying – he is revealing all the possibilities.\nIn fact, a man who has attained his uttermost being, for what will he think to become small? For what? He can’t be so foolish. For what? For what would he like to become like an elephant? What is the point in it? And why should he want to disappear? He cannot be interested in amusing people, their curiosities. He is not a magician. He is not interested in people applauding him. For what? In fact, the moment a person reaches the highest peak of his being, all desires disappear. Siddhis appear when desires disappear. This is the dilemma: powers come when you don’t want to use them. In fact, they come only when the person has disappeared who always wanted to have them.\nThis part of Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras is to make you aware that these things become possible but they are never actualized because the person who would want it, who would have always liked to go on an ego trip through these powers, is no longer there. Miraculous powers happen to you when you are not interested in them. This is the economy of existence. If you desire, you remain impotent. If you don’t desire, you become infinitely potent. This I call the law of banking: if you don’t have money, no bank is going to give you any; if you have money, every bank is ready to give you more. When you don’t need, all is available; when you are needy, nothing is available.\nBeauty, grace, strength, and adamantine hardness constitute the perfect body.\nPatanjali is not talking about this body. This body can be beautiful, but can never be perfectly beautiful. The second body can be more beautiful than this, the third even more, because they are moving closer to the center. The beauty is of the center. The farther away it has to travel, the more limited it becomes. The fourth body is even more beautiful. The fifth is almost ninety-nine percent perfect.\nBut that which is your being – the real you – is beauty, grace, strength, and adamantine hardness. It is adamantine hardness and at the same time the softness of a lotus. It is beautiful but not fragile – strong. It is strong, but not\njust hard – all opposites meet in it, as if a lotus flower is made of diamonds or a diamond is made of lotus flowers; because man and woman meet there and transcend, because sun and moon meet there and transcend.\nThe old term for yoga is hatha. This word hatha is very, very significant. Ha means sun, tha means moon; and hatha means the meeting of the sun and the moon. The union of sun and moon is yoga – unio mystica.\nIn the human body, according to the hatha yogis, there are three channels of energy. One is known as pingala; that is the right channel, connected with the left brain – the sun channel. Then there is another channel ida; the left channel, connected with the right brain – the moon channel. And then there is the third channel, the middle channel, sushumna; the central, the balanced – it is made of the sun and the moon together.\nOrdinarily your energy moves either by the pingala or by ida. Yogis’ energy starts moving through the sushumna. That is called kundalini, when the energy moves just between these two, right and left. These channels exist corresponding to your backbone. Once the energy moves in the middle channel, you become balanced. Then a person is neither a man nor a woman, neither hard nor soft; or both – man and woman, hard and soft. All the polarities disappear in sushumna; and sahasrar is the peak of sushumna.\nIf you live on the lowest point of your being, that is muladhar, the sex center, then either you move by ida or you move by pingala, the sun channel or the moon channel; and you remain divided. And you go on seeking the other, you go on asking for the other – you feel incomplete in yourself, you have to depend on the other.\nOnce your own energies meet inside, a great orgasm happens, a cosmic orgasm – when the ida and pingala dissolve into sushumna – then one is thrilled, eternally thrilled. Then one is ecstatic, continuously ecstatic; then that ecstasy knows no end. Then one never comes down, then one never comes low; one remains high. That point of highness becomes one’s innermost core, one’s very being.\nRemember again, I would like to say to you: this is the framework. We are not talking about actual things. There are foolish people who have even tried to dissect the human body to see where ida is and pingala is, and, “Where is sushumna?” They have found them nowhere. These are just indicators, symbolic.\nThere are foolish people who have tried to dissect the body and to find where the centers are. One doctor has even written a book to prove which center is exactly which complex in the body according to physiologists. These are all foolish attempts.\nYoga is not in that way scientific. It is allegorical. It is a great allegory. It is showing something and if you go inside you will find it, but there is no way to find it by dissecting a body. By postmortem you will not find these things. These are alive phenomena. And these words are simply indicative – don’t be confined to them, and don’t make a fixed obsession and doctrine out of them. Remain fluid. Take the hint, and go on the journey.\nOne more word; it is urdhvaretas. It means the upward journey of energy. Right now you are existing at the sex center, and from that center the energy goes on falling downward. Urdhvaretas means your energy starts moving upward. A delicate, very delicate phenomenon, and one has to be very alert to work with it. If you are not alert there is every possibility you will become a perverted being. It is dangerous; that’s why yogis call it “serpent power.” It is dangerous. It is like a snake – you are playing with a snake. If you don’t know how to, what to do, there is danger – you are playing with poison.\nAnd many people have become perverted because they tried to repress their sex energy in order to become urdhvaretas, to go upward. They never went upward. They even became more perverted than normal people.\nThat’s why a master is needed – one who knows where you are, where you are going, and what is going to happen next; one who can see your future and one who can see whether the right channeling is happening or not. Otherwise the whole world is in a mess of sexual perversion.\nNever repress. It is better to be normal and natural than to be perverted. But just to be normal is not enough, much more is possible: Transform. Repression is not the way of urdhvaretas – transformation is. And that can be done only if you purify your body, you purify your mind; you throw away all rubbish that you have gathered in the body and the mind. Only with a purity, light, weightlessness, will you be able to help the energy to move upward.\nOrdinarily it is like a coiled snake; that’s why we call it kundalini, or kundali. Kundali means “coiled up.” When it raises its head and moves upward, tremendous is the experience. Whenever it passes a higher center, you will have higher and higher experiences. At each center many things will be revealed to you; you are a great book. But the energy has to pass through the centers; only then can those centers reveal to you their beauties, their visions, their poetries, their songs, their dances. And each center has a higher orgasm than the lower one.\nSexual orgasm is the lowest. Higher is the orgasm of the hara. Then higher than that is the orgasm of the nabhi, the navel. Then higher than that is that of love – the heart. Then higher than that is that of the throat – creativity, sharing. Then higher than that is that of the third eye, the vision of life as really it is,\nwithout any projections – the clarity to see unclouded. And highest is that of the sahasrar, the seventh center.\nThis is the map. If you want, you can move upward, become urdhvaretas. But never try to become urdhvaretas for siddhis, powers – they are all foolish. Try to become urdhvaretas to know who you are, not for power but peace. Let peace be thy goal, never power.\nPatanjali called this chapter Vibhuti Pada; vibhuti means “power.” included this chapter so that his disciples and those who will be following him are made alert that many powers happen on the way but you are not to get entangled with them. Once you become entangled with power, once you are on a power trip, you are in trouble. You will be tied down to that spot – and your flight will be stopped. And one has to go on flying and flying till the very end, when the abyss opens and you are absorbed back into the cosmic soul.\nLet peace be thy goal.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"9577","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_chakra_book/part14/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_chakra_book/>The Chakra Book</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter 9: The Subtle Bodies According to Patanjali</h1><div class=post-meta>45 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;9577 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Chakra_Book/part14.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part13>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

Patanjali</h2><p><br></p><p>The yoga system of Patanjali is not a philosophical system. It is
empirical; it is a tool to work with – but still it has a philosophy.
That too, is just to give an intellectual understanding of where you are
moving, what you are seeking. But philosophy is arbitrary, utilitarian,
just to give a comprehensive picture of the territory you are going to
discover; but the philosophy has to be understood.</p><p>The first thing about Patanjali’s philosophy is that he divides human
personality into five seeds, five bodies. He says you don’t have one
body; you have layers upon layers of bodies – five layers.</p><p>The first body he calls <em>annamay kosh</em> – the food body, the
earth body, which is made of earth and is constantly to be nourished by
food. Food comes from the earth. If you stop taking food, your
<em>annamay kosh</em> will wither away. So one has to be very alert to
what one is eating because that makes you and it will affect you in
millions of ways. Sooner or later your food is not just food – it
becomes blood, your bones, your very marrow. It circulates in your being
and goes on affecting you. So the purity of food creates a pure
<em>annamay kosh</em> – the pure food body.</p><p>And if the first body is pure, light, not heavy, then it is easy to
enter the second body; otherwise it will be difficult, you will be
loaded. Have you seen that when you have eaten too much, and heavy
foods…? Immediately you start feeling a sort of sleep, a sort of
lethargy. You would like to go to sleep; awareness immediately starts
disappearing. When the first body is loaded it is difficult to create
great awareness. Hence fasting became so important in all the religions.
But fasting is a science and one should not fool around with it.</p><p>Just the other night a sannyasin came and she told me that she has
been fasting and now her whole body, her whole being, is disturbed –
tremendously disturbed. Now the stomach is not functioning well, and
when the stomach is not functioning well, everything is weakened, the
vitality is lost, and you cannot be alive. You become more and more
insensitive and dead.</p><p>But fasting is important. It should be done very carefully; one
should understand the functioning of the <em>annamay kosh</em> – only
then. And it should be done under the proper guidance of one who has
moved through all the phases of his <em>annamay kosh</em>. Not only
that, one who has gone beyond it and who can look at the <em>annamay
kosh</em> as a witness; otherwise fasting can be dangerous. Then, just
the right amount of food and the right quality of food has to be
practiced; fasting is not needed.</p><p>But this is important because this is your first body and, more or
less, people</p><p>cling to their first body; they never move to the second. Millions of
people are not even aware that they have a second body, a deeper body,
hidden behind the first sheath. The first covering is very gross.</p><p>The second body Patanjali calls <em>pranamay kosh</em> – the energy
body, electric body. The second consists of electric fields. That’s what
acupuncture is all about. This second body is more subtle than the
first, and people who start moving from the first body to the second
become fields of energy, tremendously attractive, magnetic, hypnotic. If
you go near them, you will feel vitalized, charged.</p><p>If you go near a man who lives only in his food body, you will be
depleted – he will suck you. Many times you come across people and you
feel that they suck you. After they have left, you feel depleted,
dissipated, as if somebody has exploited your energy. The first body is
a sucker, and the first body is very gross. So if you live too much with
first body-oriented people, you will feel always burdened, tense, bored,
sleepy, with no energy, always at the point of the lowest rung of your
energy; and you will not have any energy which can be used for higher
growth.</p><p>This type, the first type, the <em>annamay-kosh</em> oriented person
lives for food. He eats and eats and eats, and that’s his whole life. He
remains in a way childish. The first thing that the child does in the
world is to suck air, and then to suck milk. The first thing the child
has to do in the world is to help the food body, and if a person remains
food addicted, he remains childish; his growth suffers.</p><p>The second body, <em>pranamay kosh</em>, gives you a new freedom,
gives you more space. The second body is bigger than the first; it is
not confined to your physical body. It is inside the physical body and
it is outside the physical body; it surrounds you like a subtle climate,
an aura of energy. Now in Russia they have discovered that photographs
can be taken of this energy body. They call it “bioplasma,” but it
exactly means <em>prana</em> – the energy, elan vital, or what Taoists
call chi. It can be photographed; now it has become almost
scientific.</p><p>A very great discovery has been done in Russia, and that is that
before your physical body suffers an illness the energy body suffers it
– six months before – then it happens to the physical body. If you are
going to have tuberculosis, or cancer, or any illness, your energy body
starts showing indications of it six months before. No examination, no
testing of the physical body shows anything, but the electric body
starts showing it. First it appears in the <em>pranamay kosh</em>, then
it enters the <em>annamay kosh</em>.</p><p>So now they say that it has become possible to treat a person before
he has fallen ill. Once it becomes so, then there is no need for
humanity to fall ill.</p><p>Before you become aware that you are ill, your photographs by Kirlian
methods will show that some illness is going to happen to your physical
body; it can be prevented in the <em>pranamay kosh</em>.</p><p>That’s why yoga insists so much on the purity of breathing, because
the <em>pranamay kosh</em> is made of a subtle energy that travels with
the breathing, inside you. If you breathe rightly, your <em>pranamay
kosh</em> remains healthy and whole and alive. Such a person never feels
tired; such a person is always available to do anything. Such a person
is always responsive, always ready to respond to the moment, ready to
take the challenge. He is always ready. You will never find him
unprepared for any moment. Not that he plans for the future, no – but he
has so much energy that whatsoever happens he is ready to respond. He
has overflowing energy. Tai chi works on <em>pranamay kosh</em>.
<em>Pranayam</em> works on <em>pranamay kosh</em>.</p><p>If you know just how to breathe naturally, you will grow into your
second body. And the second body is stronger than the first. And the
second body lives longer than the first.</p><p>When somebody dies, for almost three days you can see his bioplasma.
Sometimes that is mistaken for his ghost. The physical body dies, but
the energy body continues to move. And those who have experimented
deeply about death say that for three days it is very difficult for the
person who has died to believe that he has died, because the same form –
and more vital than ever, more healthy than ever, more beautiful than
ever – surrounds him. It depends on how big a bioplasma you have; then
it can continue for thirteen days or even for more.</p><p>Around the <em>samadhis</em> of yogis – in India we burn everybody’s
body except the body of one who has attained to <em>Samadhi</em>; we
don’t burn his body for a certain reason. Once you burn the body, the
bioplasma starts moving away from the earth. You can feel it for a few
days, but then it disappears into the cosmos. But if the physical body
is left, then the bioplasma can cling to it. And a man who has attained
<em>samadhi</em>, who has become enlightened, if his bioplasma can
remain somewhere around his <em>samadhi</em>, many people will be
benefited by it. That’s how many people come to see their gurus’
forms.</p><p>In the Aurobindo ashram, Aurobindo’s body is put in a
<em>samadhi</em>, not destroyed, not burned. Many people have felt as if
they have seen Aurobindo around it. Or sometimes they have heard the
same footsteps, the way Aurobindo used to walk, and sometimes he is
there just standing before them. This is not Aurobindo. This is the
bioplasma. Aurobindo is gone, but the bioplasma, the <em>pranamay
kosh</em>, can persist for centuries. If the person has been really in
tune with his <em>pranamay kosh</em>, it can persist. It can have its
own</p><p>existence.</p><p>Natural breathing has to be understood. Watch small children – they
breathe naturally. That’s why small children are so full of energy; the
parents are tired, but they are not tired.</p><p><br></p><p>One child was saying to another child, “I am so full of energy that I
wear out my shoes within seven days.”</p><p>Another said, “That’s nothing. I am so full of energy I wear out my
clothes within three days.”</p><p>The third said, “That too is nothing. I am so full of energy I wear
out my parents within one hour.”</p><p><br></p><p>In America they have done an experiment: one very powerful man – an
athletic body with tremendous energy – was told to follow a small child
and imitate. Whatsoever the child does, this athlete has to do; just
imitate for eight hours. Within four hours the athlete was gone, flat on
the floor, because the child enjoyed it very much and he started doing
many things – jumping, jogging, shouting, yelling. And the athlete has
just to repeat… The child was perfectly full of energy after four hours;
the athlete was gone. He said, “He will kill me. Eight hours! Finished!
I cannot do anything more.” He was a great boxer, but boxing is one
thing. You cannot compete with a child.</p><p>From where does the energy come? It comes from <em>pranamay
kosh</em>. A child breathes naturally, and of course breathes more
<em>prana</em> in, more chi in and accumulates it in his belly. The
belly is the accumulating place, the reservoir. Watch a child; that is
the right way to breathe. When a child breathes, his chest is completely
unaffected. His belly goes up and down. He breathes as if from the
belly. All children have a little belly; that belly is there because of
their breathing and the reservoir of energy.</p><p>That is the right way to breathe; remember not to use your chest too
much. Sometimes it can be used, in emergency periods – you are running
to save your life – then the chest can be used. It is an emergency
device; then you can use shallow, fast breathing, and run. But
ordinarily the chest should not be used. And one thing to be remembered:
because the chest is meant only for emergency situations, because it is
difficult in an emergency situation to breathe naturally – if you
breathe naturally you remain so calm and quiet you cannot run, you
cannot fight, you are so calm and collected you are buddhalike… And in
an emergency – the house is on fire – if you breathe naturally, you will
not be able to save anything. Or if a tiger jumps upon you in a forest
and you go on breathing naturally you will not be bothered. You will</p><p>say, “Okay, let him do whatsoever he wants.” You will not be able to
protect yourself.</p><p>So nature has given an emergency device; the chest is an emergency
device. When a tiger attacks you, you have to drop natural breathing and
you have to breathe by the chest. Then you will have more capacity to
run, to fight, to burn energy fast. And in an emergency situation there
are only two alternatives – flight or fight. Both need a very shallow
but intense energy – shallow but a very disturbed, tense state.</p><p>Now if you continuously breathe from the chest, you will have
tensions in your mind. If you continuously breathe from the chest, you
will always be afraid because the chest breathing is meant only in
fearful situations. And if you have made it a habit then you will be
continuously afraid, tense, always in flight. The enemy is not there,
but you will imagine the enemy is there; that’s how paranoia is
created.</p><p>In the West also, a few people have come across this phenomenon –
Alexander Lowen and other bioenergetic people who have been working on
bioenergy. That is <em>prana</em>. They have come to feel that in people
who are afraid, the chest is tense and they are breathing very shallow
breaths. If their breathing can be made deeper, to go and touch the
belly, the hara center, then their fear disappears. If their musculature
can be relaxed, as is done in Rolfing… Ida Rolf has invented one of the
most beautiful methods to change the inner structure of the body because
if you have been breathing wrongly for many years, you have developed a
musculature, and that musculature will be in the way and will not allow
you to rightly breathe or deeply breathe. And even if you remember for a
few seconds and breathe deeply – again when you are engaged in your work
you will start shallow-chest breathing. The musculature has to be
changed. Once the musculature is changed, the fear disappears and the
tension disappears. Rolfing is tremendously helpful; but also working on
<em>pranamay kosh</em>, the second bioplasma body, bioenergy body, chi
body, or whatsoever you want to call it.</p><p>Watch a child; <em>that</em> is natural breathing and breathe that
way. Let your belly come up when you inhale, let your belly go down when
you exhale. And let it be in such a rhythm it becomes almost a song in
your energy, a dance – with rhythm, with harmony – and you will feel so
relaxed, so alive, so vital that you cannot imagine that such vitality
is possible.</p><p>Then is the third body, <em>manomay kosh</em> – the mental body. The
third is bigger than the second, subtler than the second, higher than
the second. Animals have the second body but not the third. Animals are
so vital: see a lion walking – what beauty, what grace, what grandeur!
Man has always felt jealous. See a</p><p>deer running – what weightlessness, what energy, what a great energy
phenomenon! Man has always felt jealous, but man’s energy is moving
higher.</p><p>The third body is <em>manomay kosh</em>, the mental body. This is
bigger, more spacious than the second. And if you don’t grow it, you
will remain just a possibility of man but not a real man. The word
<em>man</em> comes from <em>man</em>, <em>manomay</em>. The English word
also comes from the Sanskrit root <em>man</em>. The Hindi word for man
is <em>manushya</em>; that too comes from the same root <em>man</em>,
the mind. It is mind that makes you man, but more or less you don’t have
it. What you have in its place is just a conditioned mechanism. You live
by imitation: then you don’t have a mind. When you start living on your
own – spontaneous – when you start answering your life problems on your
own, when you become responsible, you start growing in <em>manomay
kosh</em>. Then the mind-body grows.</p><p>Ordinarily if you are a Hindu or a Mohammedan or a Christian you have
a borrowed mind; it is not your mind. Maybe Christ attained to a great
explosion of <em>manomay kosh</em> and then people have been simply
repeating it. That repetition will not become a growth in you. That
repetition will be a hindrance. Don’t repeat: rather try to understand.
Become more and more alive, authentic, responsive. Even if there is a
possibility to go astray, go astray. Because there is no way to grow if
you are so afraid of committing errors. Errors are good; mistakes have
to be committed. Never commit the same mistake again, but never be
afraid of committing mistakes. People who become so afraid of committing
mistakes never grow. They go on sitting in their place, afraid to move.
They are not alive.</p><p>The mind grows when you face, encounter, situations on your own. You
bring your own energy to solve them. Don’t go asking for advice forever.
Take the reins of your life in your own hands; that’s what I mean when I
say do your thing. You will be in trouble – it is safer to follow
others, it is convenient to follow the society, to follow the routine,
the tradition, the scripture. It is very easy because everybody is
following – you have just to become a dead part of the herd, you have
just to move with the crowd wherever it is going; it is none of your
responsibility. But your mental body, your <em>manomay kosh</em>, will
suffer tremendously, terribly; it will not grow. You will not have your
own mind, and you will miss something very, very beautiful and something
which functions as a bridge for higher growth.</p><p>So always remember, whatsoever I say to you, you can take it in two
ways. You can simply take it on my authority: “Osho says so, it must be
true” – then you will suffer, then you will not grow. Whatsoever I say,
listen to it, try to understand it, implement it in your life, see how
it works, and then come to your own conclusions. They may be the same,
they may not be. They can never</p><p>be exactly the same because you have a different personality, a
unique being. Whatsoever I am saying is my own. It is bound to be in
deep ways rooted in me. You may come to similar conclusions, but they
cannot be exactly the same. So my conclusions should not be made your
conclusions. You should try to understand me, you should try to learn,
but you should not collect knowledge from me, you should not collect
conclusions from me. Then your mind-body will grow.</p><p>But people take shortcuts. They say, “If you have known, finished.
What is the need for us to try and experiment? We will believe in you.”
A believer has no <em>manomay kosh</em>. He has a false <em>manomay
kosh</em> which has not come out of his own being but has been forced
from without.</p><p>Then higher than <em>manomay kosh</em>, bigger than <em>manomay
kosh</em>, is <em>vigyanamay kosh</em> – it is the intuitive body. It is
very, very spacious. Now there is no reason in it; it goes beyond
reason, has become very, very subtle. It is an intuitive grasp. It is a
<em>seeing</em> directly into the nature of things. It is not trying to
think about it.</p><p>The cypress tree in the courtyard: you just look at it. You don’t
think about it; there is no “about” in intuition. You simply become
available, receptive, and reality reveals to you its nature. You don’t
project. You are not searching for any argument, for any conclusion,
nothing whatsoever. You are not even searching. You are simply waiting,
and reality reveals – it is a revelation. The intuitive body takes you
to very far out horizons, but still there is one body more.</p><p>That is the fifth body, <em>anandmay kosh</em> – the bliss body. That
is really far out!</p><p>It is made of pure bliss. Even intuition is transcended.</p><p>These five seeds are just seeds, remember. Beyond these five is
<em>your</em> reality. These are just seeds surrounding you: the first
is very gross; you are almost confined in a six-foot body. The second is
bigger than it, the third still bigger, the fourth still bigger, the
fifth is very big; but still these are seeds. All are limited. If all
the seeds are dropped and you stand nude in your reality, then you are
infinite. That’s what yoga says: you are godly – <em>aham
brahmasmi</em>. You are the very <em>brahman</em>. Now you are ultimate
reality itself; now all barriers are dropped.</p><p>Try to understand this. The barriers are there surrounding you in
circles. The first barrier is very, very hard. To get out of it is very
difficult. People remain confined to their physical bodies and they
think their physical life is all that there is to life.</p><p>Don’t settle… The physical body is just a step to the energy body.
The energy body is again just a step for the mind body. That too in its
own, just a</p><p>step for the intuitive body. That too, a step for the bliss body. And
from bliss you take the jump – now there are no more steps – you take
the jump into the abyss of your being that is infinity, eternity.</p><p>These are five seeds.</p><p>Corresponding to these five seeds, yoga has another doctrine about
five <em>bhutas</em>, five great elements. Just as your body is made of
food, earth; the earth is the first element. It has nothing to do with
this earth, remember. The element simply says wherever there is matter
it is earth; the material is the earth, the gross is the earth. In you
it is the body; outside you it is the body of all. The stars are made of
earth. Everything that exists is made of earth. The first shell is of
earth. Five <em>bhutas</em> means five great elements: earth, fire,
water, air, ether.</p><p>Earth corresponds to your first, <em>annamay kosh</em>, the food
body. Fire corresponds to your second body, energy body, bioplasma, chi,
<em>pranamay kosh</em>; it has the quality of fire. Third is water. It
corresponds to the third, <em>manomay</em> body, the mental body; it has
the quality of water. Watch the mind, how it goes on like a flux, always
moving, moving riverlike. The fourth is air, almost invisible; you
cannot see it but it is there. You can only feel it. That corresponds to
the intuitive body, <em>vigyanamay kosh</em>. And then there <em>is
akash</em>, ether; you cannot even feel it. It has become even more
subtle than air. You can simply believe it, trust it that it is there.
It is pure space; that is bliss.</p><p>But you are purer than pure space, subtler than pure space. Your
reality is almost as if it is not. That’s why Buddha says
<em>anatta</em> – no-self. Your self is like a no-self; your being is
almost like a nonbeing. Why nonbeing? Because it has gone so far away
from all gross elements. It is pure is-ness. Nothing can be said about
it, no description will be adequate for it.</p><p>These are five <em>bhutas</em>, five great elements, corresponding to
five <em>koshs</em>, bodies, within you.</p><p>Then the third doctrine – I would like you to understand all these
because they will be helpful in understanding the sutras that we will be
discussing now. Then there are seven chakras. The word <em>chakra</em>
does not really mean center; the word <em>center</em> cannot explain it
or describe it or translate it rightly because when we say “the center,”
it seems something static. And <em>chakra</em> means something dynamic.
The word <em>chakra</em> means “the wheel,” the moving wheel. So a
chakra is a dynamic center in your being, almost like a whirlpool,
whirlwind, the center of the cyclone. It is dynamic; it creates an
energy field around it.</p><p>Seven chakras. The first is a bridge and the last is also a bridge;
the remaining five correspond to five <em>mahabhutas</em>, the great
elements and the five seeds. Sex is a bridge, a bridge between you and
the grossest – the <em>prakriti</em>,</p><p>nature. <em>Sahasrar</em>, the seventh chakra is also a bridge, a
bridge between you and the abyss – the ultimate. These two are bridges.
The remaining five centers correspond to five elements and five
bodies.</p><p>This is the framework of Patanjali’s system. Remember it is
arbitrary. It has to be used as a tool, not discussed as a dogma. It is
not a doctrine in any theology. It is just a utilitarian map. You go to
some territory, to some strange country, unknown, and you take a map
with you. The map does not really represent the territory; how can the
map represent the territory? The map is so small, the territory is so
big. On the map, cities are just points. How can those points correspond
to big cities? On the map, roads are just lines. How can roads be just
lines? Mountains are just marked, rivers are just marked – and small
ones are left out. Only big ones are marked. This is a map; it is not a
doctrine.</p><p>There are not only five bodies, there are many bodies because between
two bodies there is another to join it, and so on and so forth. You are
like an onion, layers upon layers, but these five will do. These are the
main bodies, the chief ones. So don’t be too worried about it – because
Buddhists say there are seven bodies, and Jainas say there are nine
bodies. Nothing wrong and there is no contradiction because these are
just maps. If you are studying the whole world’s map, then even big
cities disappear, even big rivers disappear. If you are studying a map
of a nation, then many new things appear which were not on the world
map. And if you are studying the map of a province, then many more
things appear. And if you are studying the map of a district, of course
many more. And if just of one city, then many more, and if just of one
house, then of course things go on appearing, it depends.</p><p>Jainas say nine. Buddha says seven. Patanjali says five. There are
schools which say only three. And they all are true because they are not
discussing any argument, they are just giving you a few tools to work
with.</p><p>And I think five is almost perfect because more than five is too
much, less than five is too few. Five seems almost perfect, and
Patanjali is a very balanced thinker.</p><p>Now a few things about these chakras: The first chakra, the first
dynamic center, is sex – <em>muladhar</em>. It joins you with nature, it
joins you with the past, it joins you with the future. You were born out
of two persons’ sexual play. Your parents’ sexual play became the cause
of your birth. You are related to your parents through the sex center,
and to your parents’ parents and so on and so forth. You are related to
the whole past through the sex center. The thread runs through the sex
center and if you give birth to a child, you will be related to the
future.</p><p>Jesus insists many times, in a very rude way, “If you don’t hate your
mother</p><p>and your father, you cannot come and follow me.” It looks almost
hard, almost unbelievable that a man like Jesus… Why should he use such
hard words? And he is compassion incarnate, and he is love. Why does he
say, “Hate your mother, hate your father if you want to follow me”? The
meaning is: drop out of the sexual context. What he is saying
symbolically is go beyond the sex center, then immediately you are no
longer related with the past, no longer related with the future.</p><p>It is sex that makes you part of time. Once you go beyond sex, you
become part of eternity, not of time. Then suddenly only the present
exists. You are the present but if you see yourself through the sex
center, you are the past also because your eyes will have the color of
your mother and your father, and your body will have atoms and cells
from millions of generations. Your whole structure, biostructure, is
part of a long continuum. You are part of a big chain.</p><p>In India, they say your debt to your parents cannot be fulfilled
unless you give birth to children. If you want that your debt should be
fulfilled with the past, you have to create the future. If you really
want to repay, there is no other way. Your mother loved you, your father
loved you – what can you do now they are gone? You can become a mother,
a father to children and repay it to nature – to the same reservoir from
where your parents came, you came, your children will come.</p><p>Sex is the great chain. It is the whole chain of the world, samsara,
and it is the link with others. Have you watched it? The moment you feel
sexual you start thinking of the other; when you are not feeling sexual
you never think of the other. A person who is beyond sex is beyond
others. He may live in the society, but he is not in the society. He may
be walking in the crowd, but he walks alone. And a man who is sexual may
be sitting on the top of Everest, alone, but he will think of the other.
He may be sent to the moon to meditate, but he will meditate about the
other.</p><p>Sex is the bridge with the others. Once sex disappears the chain is
broken. For the first time you become an individual. That’s why people
may be too obsessed with sex, but they are never happy with it because
it is double-edged. It links you with others, it does not allow you to
be individual. It does not allow you to be yourself. It forces you into
patterns, into slaveries, bondages. But if you don’t know how to
transcend it, that’s the only way to use your energy – it becomes a
safety valve.</p><p>People who live at the first center, <em>muladhar</em>, live only for
a very foolish reason. They go on creating energy and then they are too
burdened with it. Then they go on throwing it away. They eat, they work,
they sleep, they do many things to create energy. Then they say, “What
to do with it? It is very</p><p>heavy.” Then they throw it – seems a very vicious circle! When they
throw it away, they again feel empty. They fill with new fuel, with new
food, with new work, and again when the energy is there they are
“feeling too full,” they say. Somewhere it has to be released. And sex
becomes just a release: a vicious circle of accumulating energy,
throwing energy, accumulating energy, throwing energy. It looks almost
absurd.</p><p>Unless you know that there are higher centers within you that can
take that energy – use it in a creative way – you will remain confined
to the sexual vicious circle. That’s why all the religions insist on
some sort of sexual control. It can become repressive, it can become
dangerous. If new centers are not opening and you go on damming energy,
condemning, forcing, repressing, then you are on a volcano. Any day you
will explode; you will become neurotic. You are going to be mad. Then it
is better to relieve it. But there are centers which can absorb the
energy, and greater being and greater possibilities can be revealed to
you.</p><p>Remember, we have been saying in the past few days that the second
center, near the sex center, is the hara, the center of death. That’s
why people are afraid to move beyond sex because the moment the energy
moves beyond sex it touches the hara center and one becomes afraid.
That’s why people are even afraid to move deeply in love because when
you move deeply into love, the sex center creates such ripples that the
ripples enter the hara center and fear arises.</p><p>So many people come to me and they say, “Why do we feel so afraid of
the other sex?” – of men or women – “Why do we feel so afraid?” It is
not the fear of the other sex, it is the fear of sex itself because if
you go deeply into sex, then the center becomes more dynamic, creates
bigger energy fields and those energy fields start overlapping with the
hara center. Have you watched? In a sexual orgasm something starts
moving just below your navel, throbbing. That throb is the overlapping
of the sex center with the hara. That’s why people become afraid of sex
also. Particularly people become afraid of deep intimacy, of orgasm
itself.</p><p>But that second center has to be entered, penetrated, opened. That’s
the meaning when Jesus says unless you are ready to die, you cannot be
reborn.</p><p>Just a few days ago, on Easter, somebody has asked a question, “Today
is Easter, have you something to say?” I have only one thing to say,
that each day is Easter because Easter is the day of Jesus’ resurrection
– his crucifixion and resurrection, his death and his being reborn. Each
day is an Easter if you are ready to move into the hara center. You will
be crucified first – the cross is there within your hara center. You are
already carrying it; you just have to move to it and you have to die
through it, and then there is resurrection.</p><p>Once you die in the hara center, death disappears; then for the first
time you become aware of a new world, a new dimension. Then you can see
the center higher than the hara; that is the navel center. And the navel
center becomes the resurrection because it is the most energy-conserving
center. It is the very reservoir of energy.</p><p>And once you know that you have moved from the sex center to the
hara, now you know that there is a possibility of moving inward. You
have opened one door. Now you cannot rest unless you have opened all the
doors. Now you cannot remain on the porch; you have entered the palace.
Then you can open another door and another door…</p><p>Just in the middle is the heart center. The heart center divides the
lower and the higher. First is the sex center, then the hara, then the
navel, and then comes the heart center. Three centers are below it,
three centers are above it: The heart is exactly in the middle.</p><p>You must have seen Solomon’s seal. In Judaism, particularly in
Cabalistic thinking, Solomon’s seal is one of the most important
symbols. That Solomon’s seal is the symbol of the heart center. Sex
moves downward, so sex is like a triangle pointed downward.
<em>Sahasrar</em> moves upward, so <em>sahasrar</em> is a triangle
moving upward, pointed upward. And the heart is just in the middle,
where the sex triangle comes to meet the <em>sahasrar</em> triangle.
Both triangles meet, merge into each other, and it becomes a six-pointed
star, that is the seal of Solomon. The heart is the seal of Solomon.</p><p>Once you have opened the heart, then you are available for the
highest possibilities. Below the heart you remain man; beyond the heart
you have become superman.</p><p>After the heart center there is the throat center, then there is the
third-eye center, and then <em>sahasrar</em>.</p><p>The heart is feeling love. The heart is absorbing love, becoming
love. The throat is expression, communication, sharing, giving it to
others. And if you give love to others, then the third-eye center starts
functioning. Once you start giving, you go higher and higher. A person
who goes on taking goes lower and lower and lower. A person who goes on
giving goes higher and higher and higher. A miser is the worst
possibility a man can fall into, and a sharer is the greatest
possibility that a man can become available to.</p><p>Five bodies, five <em>mahabhutas</em>, and five centers, plus two
bridges; this is the framework, the map. Behind this framework is the
whole effort of the yogi, of bringing <em>samyama</em> to every nook and
corner, so one becomes enlightened, full of light.</p><p>Now the sutras of Patanjali – he says:</p><p>The power of contacting the state of consciousness which is outside
the mental body, manomay sharir, and therefore inconceivable</p><p>is called mahavideha.</p><p>Through this power</p><p>the covering of the light is destroyed.</p><p>Once you are beyond the mind-body, for the first time you become
aware that you are not the mind but the witness. Below the mind you
remain identified with it. Once you know that thoughts, mental images,
ideas, are just objects, floating clouds in your consciousness – you are
separate from them immediately.</p><p>The power of contacting the state of consciousness which is outside
the mental body and therefore inconceivable is called
<em>mahavideha</em>. You become beyond body. <em>Mahavideha</em> means
one who is beyond body, one who is no longer confined to any body, one
who knows that he is not the body, gross or subtle, one who knows that
he is infinite, with no boundaries. <em>Mahavideha</em> means one who
has come to feel that he has no boundaries. All boundaries are
confinements, imprisonments; and he can break them, drop them, and he
can become one with the infinite sky.</p><p>This moment of realizing oneself as the infinite is the moment:
<em>through this power the covering of the light is destroyed.</em> Then
the covering is dropped which has been hiding your light. You are like a
light which is being hidden under covers and covers, by and by each and
every cover has to be taken away; more light will penetrate out of
it.</p><p>Manomay kosh<span class=p>, the mental body, once dropped you
become meditation, you become a no-mind. All our effort here is how to
go beyond the</span>manomay kosh <span class=p>– how to become aware:
“I am not the thinking process.”</span></p><p>Performing samyama on their gross, constant, subtle, all-pervading,
and functional state brings mastery over the panchabhutas –</p><p>the five elements.</p><p>This is one of the most potential sutras of Patanjali, and very
significant for future science. One day or other, science is going to
discover the meaning of this sutra.</p><p>Science is already on the path toward it. This sutra says that all
the elements in the world, the <em>pancha mahabhutas</em> – earth, air,
fire, etcetera – they come out of nothing, and they go again into
nothingness to rest. Everything comes out of nothing and when tired,
goes back and rests into nothingness.</p><p>Now science, particularly physicists, agree with it: that matter has
come out</p><p>of nothing. The deeper they have gone into matter, the more they have
discovered that there is nothing like the material. The deeper they go,
matter becomes more and more elusive and finally it slips out of their
fingers. Nothing remains, just emptiness, just pure space. Out of pure
space everything is born. Looks very illogical – but life is illogical.
The whole of modern science has become illogical because if you persist
in your logic, you cannot move into reality. If you move into reality
you have to drop logic. And of course when there is a choice between
logic and reality, how can you choose logic? You have to drop logic.</p><p>Just fifty years ago, scientists came to realize that quanta,
electric particles, behave in a very ridiculous way, behave like a Zen
master – unbelievable, absurd – sometimes they look like waves and
sometimes they look like particles. Now before that it was a tacit
understanding that something can be <em>either</em> a particle or a
wave. One and the same thing cannot be both together, simultaneously. A
particle and a wave? It means something can be a point and a line
together, at the same time. Impossible! Euclid will not agree. Aristotle
will simply deny – you have gone mad. A point is a point, and a line is
many points in a row, so how can one point be a line also at the same
time remaining a point? Looks absurd – and Euclid and Aristotle
prevailed.</p><p>Just fifty years before, their whole edifice collapsed because
scientists came to know that the quantum, the electric particle, behaves
in both ways simultaneously.</p><p>Logicians raised arguments, and they said, “This is not possible.”
Physicists said, “What can we do? It is not a question of possibility or
impossibility. It is so! We cannot do anything. If the quantum is not
going to follow Aristotle, what can we do? And if the quantum behaves in
a non-Euclidean way and does not follow the geometry of Euclid, what can
we do? We have to listen to the behavior of the real and the
reality.”</p><p>This is one of the very critical moments in the history of human
consciousness. It has always been believed that something can come only
out of something. Simple and natural, obviously so. How can something
come out of nothing? Then matter disappeared, and the scientists have to
conclude that everything is born out of nothing, and everything
disappears again into nothing. Now they are talking about black holes.
Black holes are holes of tremendous nothingness. I have to call it
“tremendous nothingness” because that nothingness is not just an
absence. It is full of energy, but the energy is of nothingness. There
is nothing to find, but there is energy.</p><p>Now they say there exist black holes in existence. They are parallel
to stars – stars are positive, and parallel to each star there is a
black hole. The star is;</p><p>the black hole is not. Each star when burned, exhausted, becomes a
black hole. And each black hole, when rested, becomes a star.</p><p>Matter, no-matter go on changing. Matter becomes no-matter; no-matter
becomes matter. Life becomes death; death becomes life. Love becomes
hate; hate becomes love. Polarities continuously change.</p><p>This sutra says, <em>Performing</em> samyama <em>on their gross,
constant, subtle, all- pervading, and functional state brings mastery
over the</em> panchabhutas – <em>the five elements.</em> Patanjali is
saying that if you have come to understand your true nature of
witnessing, and then if you concentrate – you bring <em>samyama</em> on
any matter – you can make it appear or disappear. You can help things to
materialize because they come out of nothingness. And you can help
things to dematerialize.</p><p>Now, that yet remains to be seen by physicists, whether it is
possible or not. It is happening that matter changes and becomes
no-matter, no-matter changes, becomes matter. They have come to feel
many absurd things these fifty years. It is one of the most potential
ages ever, where so many things have exploded that it has become almost
impossible to confine them in a system. How to make a system? It was
very easy just fifty years earlier to create a self-contained system and
now it is impossible. Reality has poked its nose from everywhere and
destroyed all doctrinaires, systems, dogmas. Reality has proved to be
too much.</p><p>Scientists say it is happening. Patanjali says it can be made to
happen. If it is happening, then why can it not be made to happen? Just
watch. You heat water; at a hundred degrees it becomes vapor. It has
always been happening, before fire was ever discovered. The sun rays
were evaporating water from the seas and rivers, and clouds were forming
and water was coming back again into the rivers, again evaporating. Then
man discovered fire, and then he started heating water, evaporating
it.</p><p>Whatever is happening, ways and means can be found to make it happen.
If it is already happening then it is not against reality, then you have
just to know how to make it happen. If matter becomes no-matter,
no-matter becomes matter, if things change polarities, things disappear
into nothingness and things appear out of nothingness – if this is
already happening – then Patanjali says ways and means can be found
through which it can be made to happen. And this he says is the way: if
you have come to recognize your being, beyond the five seeds, you become
capable of materializing things or dematerializing things.</p><p>It still remains for the scientific workers to find out whether it is
possible or not, but it seems plausible. There seems to be no logical
problem in it.</p><p>From this follows the attainment of anima, etcetera,</p><p>Perfection of the body, and</p><p>the removal of the elements’ power to obstruct the body.</p><p>And then come the eight <em>siddhis</em>, eight powers of yogis. The
first is <em>anima</em>, and then there is <em>laghima</em> and
<em>garima</em>, etcetera. The eight powers of the yogi are that they
can make their body disappear, or they can make their body so small, so
small that it becomes almost invisible, or they can make their bodies so
big, as big as they want. It is under their control to make the body
small, big, or disappear completely, or to appear in many places
simultaneously.</p><p>Looks impossible, but things that look impossible by and by become
possible. It was impossible for man to fly; nobody ever believed – the
Wright brothers were thought to be mad, insane. When they invented their
first airplane, they were so afraid to tell people – that if people come
to know, they would be caught and hospitalized. The first flight was
done completely unknown to anybody, just these two brothers. And they
invented their first airplane hiding in a basement, so nobody came to
know what they were doing. Everybody had believed that they had gone
completely mad – who has ever flown? Their first air flight was of sixty
seconds only – only of sixty seconds – but it changed the whole of
history tremendously, the whole of humanity. It became possible.</p><p>Nobody had ever thought that the atom could be split. It was split,
and now man can never be the same again.</p><p>Many things have happened which were always thought to be impossible.
We have reached the moon; it was the symbol of impossibility. In all the
languages of the world there are expressions like, “Don’t long for the
moon.” That means don’t long for the impossible. Now we have to change
those expressions. And in fact, once we have reached the moon, now
nothing debars the path. Now everything has become available; it is only
a question of time.</p><p>Einstein has said that if we can invent a vehicle which moves with
the speed of light, then a person can go on traveling and he will never
age. If he goes on a spaceship that moves with the speed of light when
he is thirty years old, and comes back after thirty years, he will
remain thirty years old. His friends and brothers will be sixty years
old, a few of them will be already dead, but the person will remain
thirty years old. What nonsense are you saying? Einstein says time and
its effect disappear when one is moving with the speed of light. A man
can go on infinite space travel and can come back after five hundred
years. All the people here will be gone, nobody will recognize him and
he will not recognize anybody, but he will remain the same age. You are
aging because of the speed of the earth. If the speed is as much as
light, which is really</p><p>tremendous, then you will not age at all.</p><p>Patanjali says that if you have moved beyond all the five bodies, you
have gone beyond all five elements. Now you are in a state from where
you can control anything you wish. Just by the idea that you want to
become small, you will become small; if you want to become big, you will
become big; if you want to disappear, you can disappear.</p><p>It is not necessarily that yogis should do it. Buddhas have never
been known to do it. Patanjali himself has not been known to do it. What
Patanjali is saying – he is revealing all the possibilities.</p><p>In fact, a man who has attained his uttermost being, for what will he
think to become small? For what? He can’t be so foolish. For what? For
what would he like to become like an elephant? What is the point in it?
And why should he want to disappear? He cannot be interested in amusing
people, their curiosities. He is not a magician. He is not interested in
people applauding him. For what? In fact, the moment a person reaches
the highest peak of his being, all desires disappear. <em>Siddhis</em>
appear when desires disappear. This is the dilemma: powers come when you
don’t want to use them. In fact, they come only when the person has
disappeared who always wanted to have them.</p><p>This part of Patanjali’s <em>Yoga Sutras</em> is to make you aware
that these things become possible but they are never actualized because
the person who would want it, who would have always liked to go on an
ego trip through these powers, is no longer there. Miraculous powers
happen to you when you are not interested in them. This is the economy
of existence. If you desire, you remain impotent. If you don’t desire,
you become infinitely potent. This I call the law of banking: if you
don’t have money, no bank is going to give you any; if you have money,
every bank is ready to give you more. When you don’t need, all is
available; when you are needy, nothing is available.</p><p>Beauty, grace, strength, and adamantine hardness constitute the
perfect body.</p><p>Patanjali is not talking about <em>this</em> body. This body can be
beautiful, but can never be perfectly beautiful. The second body can be
more beautiful than this, the third even more, because they are moving
closer to the center. The beauty is of the center. The farther away it
has to travel, the more limited it becomes. The fourth body is even more
beautiful. The fifth is almost ninety-nine percent perfect.</p><p>But that which is your being – the real you – is beauty, grace,
strength, and adamantine hardness. It is adamantine hardness and at the
same time the softness of a lotus. It is beautiful but not fragile –
strong. It is strong, but not</p><p>just hard – all opposites meet in it, as if a lotus flower is made of
diamonds or a diamond is made of lotus flowers; because man and woman
meet there and transcend, because sun and moon meet there and
transcend.</p><p>The old term for yoga is <em>hatha</em>. This word <em>hatha</em> is
very, very significant. <em>Ha</em> means sun, <em>tha</em> means moon;
and <em>hatha</em> means the meeting of the sun and the moon. The union
of sun and moon is yoga – <em>unio mystica</em>.</p><p>In the human body, according to the <em>hatha</em> yogis, there are
three channels of energy. One is known as <em>pingala</em>; that is the
right channel, connected with the left brain – the sun channel. Then
there is another channel <em>ida</em>; the left channel, connected with
the right brain – the moon channel. And then there is the third channel,
the middle channel, <em>sushumna</em>; the central, the balanced – it is
made of the sun and the moon together.</p><p>Ordinarily your energy moves either by the <em>pingala</em> or by
<em>ida</em>. Yogis’ energy starts moving through the <em>sushumna</em>.
That is called kundalini, when the energy moves just between these two,
right and left. These channels exist corresponding to your backbone.
Once the energy moves in the middle channel, you become balanced. Then a
person is neither a man nor a woman, neither hard nor soft; or both –
man and woman, hard and soft. All the polarities disappear in
<em>sushumna</em>; and <em>sahasrar</em> is the peak of
<em>sushumna</em>.</p><p>If you live on the lowest point of your being, that is
<em>muladhar</em>, the sex center, then either you move by <em>ida</em>
or you move by <em>pingala</em>, the sun channel or the moon channel;
and you remain divided. And you go on seeking the other, you go on
asking for the other – you feel incomplete in yourself, you have to
depend on the other.</p><p>Once your own energies meet inside, a great orgasm happens, a cosmic
orgasm – when the <em>ida</em> and <em>pingala</em> dissolve into
<em>sushumna</em> – then one is thrilled, eternally thrilled. Then one
is ecstatic, continuously ecstatic; then that ecstasy knows no end. Then
one never comes down, then one never comes low; one remains high. That
point of highness becomes one’s innermost core, one’s very being.</p><p>Remember again, I would like to say to you: this is the framework. We
are not talking about actual things. There are foolish people who have
even tried to dissect the human body to see where <em>ida</em> is and
<em>pingala</em> is, and, “Where is <em>sushumna</em>?” They have found
them nowhere. These are just indicators, symbolic.</p><p>There are foolish people who have tried to dissect the body and to
find where the centers are. One doctor has even written a book to prove
which center is exactly which complex in the body according to
physiologists. These are all foolish attempts.</p><p>Yoga is not in <em>that</em> way scientific. It is allegorical. It is
a great allegory. It is showing something and if you go inside you will
find it, but there is no way to find it by dissecting a body. By
postmortem you will not find these things. These are alive phenomena.
And these words are simply indicative – don’t be confined to them, and
don’t make a fixed obsession and doctrine out of them. Remain fluid.
Take the hint, and go on the journey.</p><p>One more word; it is <em>urdhvaretas</em>. It means the upward
journey of energy. Right now you are existing at the sex center, and
from that center the energy goes on falling downward.
<em>Urdhvaretas</em> means your energy starts moving upward. A delicate,
very delicate phenomenon, and one has to be very alert to work with it.
If you are not alert there is every possibility you will become a
perverted being. It is dangerous; that’s why yogis call it “serpent
power.” It is dangerous. It is like a snake – you are playing with a
snake. If you don’t know how to, what to do, there is danger – you are
playing with poison.</p><p>And many people have become perverted because they tried to repress
their sex energy in order to become <em>urdhvaretas</em>, to go upward.
They never went upward. They even became more perverted than normal
people.</p><p>That’s why a master is needed – one who knows where you are, where
you are going, and what is going to happen next; one who can see your
future and one who can see whether the right channeling is happening or
not. Otherwise the whole world is in a mess of sexual perversion.</p><p>Never repress. It is better to be normal and natural than to be
perverted. But just to be normal is not enough, much more is possible:
Transform. Repression is not the way of <em>urdhvaretas</em> –
transformation is. And that can be done only if you purify your body,
you purify your mind; you throw away all rubbish that you have gathered
in the body and the mind. Only with a purity, light, weightlessness,
will you be able to help the energy to move upward.</p><p>Ordinarily it is like a coiled snake; that’s why we call it
kundalini, or <em>kundali</em>. <em>Kundali</em> means “coiled up.” When
it raises its head and moves upward, tremendous is the experience.
Whenever it passes a higher center, you will have higher and higher
experiences. At each center many things will be revealed to you; you are
a great book. But the energy has to pass through the centers; only then
can those centers reveal to you their beauties, their visions, their
poetries, their songs, their dances. And each center has a higher orgasm
than the lower one.</p><p>Sexual orgasm is the lowest. Higher is the orgasm of the hara. Then
higher than that is the orgasm of the <em>nabhi</em>, the navel. Then
higher than that is that of love – the heart. Then higher than that is
that of the throat – creativity, sharing. Then higher than that is that
of the third eye, the vision of life as really it is,</p><p>without any projections – the clarity to see unclouded. And highest
is that of the <em>sahasrar</em>, the seventh center.</p><p>This is the map. If you want, you can move upward, become
<em>urdhvaretas</em>. But never try to become <em>urdhvaretas</em> for
<em>siddhis</em>, powers – they are all foolish. Try to become
<em>urdhvaretas</em> to know who you are, not for power but peace. Let
peace be thy goal, never power.</p><p>Patanjali called this chapter <em>Vibhuti Pada</em>; <em>vibhuti</em>
means “power.” included this chapter so that his disciples and those who
will be following him are made alert that many powers happen on the way
but you are not to get entangled with them. Once you become entangled
with power, once you are on a power trip, you are in trouble. You will
be tied down to that spot – and your flight will be stopped. And one has
to go on flying and flying till the very end, when the abyss opens and
you are absorbed back into the cosmic soul.</p><p>Let peace be thy goal.</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part13>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

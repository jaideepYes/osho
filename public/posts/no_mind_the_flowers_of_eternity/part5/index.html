ONE DAY CHOSA WENT FOR A WALK AND WHEN HE RETURNED TO THE GATE, THE HEAD MONK ASKED HIM, “OSHO, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN STROLLING?”\nCHOSA REPLIED, “I HAVE COME FROM WALKING IN THE HILLS.” THE HEAD MONK SAID, “WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?”\nCHOSA SAID, “FIRST I WENT FOLLOWING THE FRAGRANT GRASSES, AND NOW I HAVE RETURNED IN PURSUIT OF THE FALLING BLOSSOMS.”\nAT THIS THE HEAD MONK COMMENTED, “YOU ARE FULL OF THE SPRING.”\nCHOSA REPLIED, “BETTER THAN THE AUTUMN DEWS FALLING ON THE LOTUS LEAVES.”\nONE EVENING CHOSA (WHO WAS KYOZAN’S “UNCLE” IN THE DHARMA LINEAGE) WAS ENJOYING THE MOONLIGHT WITH KYOZAN, WHO SAID, “EVERYONE HAS ‘THIS ONE THING’ BUT DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO USE IT.”\nCHOSA REPLIED, “PERHAPS I SHOULD EMPLOY YOU AND USE IT.” KYOZAN EXCLAIMED, “TRY IT!”\nINSTANTLY, CHOSA TRAMPLED ON KYOZAN.\nKYOZAN THEN COMMENTED, “UNCLE, YOU ARE LIKE A FIERCE TIGER!”\nMy Beloved Ones,\nThese four days have been of immense difficulty to me. I had thought that Gautam Buddha would be understanding of the change of times, but it was impossible. I tried my hardest, but he is so much disciplined in his own way – twenty-five centuries back – he has become a hard bone.\nSmall things became difficult.\nHe used to sleep only on the right side. He did not use a pillow; he used his hand as a pillow. The pillow was, for him, a luxury.\nI told him, “The poor pillow is not a luxury, and it is sheer torture to keep your hand the whole night under your head. And do you think to lie down on the right side is right, and the left is wrong? As far as I am concerned, this is my basic fundamental, that I synthesize both the sides.”\nHe was eating only one time per day and he wanted, without saying a word, that I should do it also. He used to beg his food. He asked me, “Where is my begging bowl?”\nThis evening exactly at six o’clock when I was taking my jacuzzi, he became very much disturbed – “Jacuzzi?” Taking a bath twice a day was again a luxury.\nI said, “You have fulfilled your prophecy that you will be coming back. Four days are enough – I say goodbye to you! And now you need not wander around the earth; you just disappear in the ultimate blue sky.\n“You have seen for four days that I am doing the work that you wanted to do, and I am doing it according to the times and the needs. I am not in any way ready to be dictated to. I am a free individual. Out of my freedom and love I have received you as a guest, but don’t try to become a host.”\nThese four days I have been having a headache. I had not known it for thirty years, I had completely forgotten what it means to have a headache. Everything was impossible. He is so accustomed to his way, and that way is no longer relevant.\nSo now I make a far greater historical statement, that I am just myself.\nYou can continue to call me The Buddha, but it has nothing to do with Gautam the Buddha or Maitreya the Buddha. I am a buddha in my own right. The word ‘buddha’ simply means the awakened one.\nIt will be a great difficulty for poor Anando, because now I declare that my name should be Shree Rajneesh Zorba The Buddha.\nI have to offer an apology to Katue Ishida, the seeress in an ancient Shinto shrine in Japan. I tried my hardest to accommodate a twenty-five centuries old, out-of-date individuality, but I am not ready to be in a self torture.\nAnd Anando has to see me afterwards, to release the second story... because that makes me absolutely free from any kind of tradition. I used to think that Gautam Buddha is an individual – and that is true, he is. But even against his desire a tradition has arisen in Tibet, in China, in Japan, in Sri Lanka, and I don’t want to struggle with these idiots. I want to work with my own people on my own authority.\nManeesha has asked:\nBELOVED BUDDHA,\nCHOSA WAS A DISCIPLE OF NANSEN AND A CONTEMPORARY OF TOKUSAN, RINZAI AND ISAN. ONE DAY CHOSA WENT FOR A WALK AND WHEN HE RETURNED TO THE GATE, THE HEAD MONK ASKED HIM, “OSHO, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN STROLLING?”\nCHOSA REPLIED, “I HAVE COME FROM WALKING IN THE HILLS.” THE HEAD MONK SAID, “WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?”\nCHOSA SAID, “FIRST I WENT FOLLOWING THE FRAGRANT GRASSES, AND NOW I HAVE RETURNED IN PURSUIT OF THE FALLING BLOSSOMS.”\nAT THIS THE HEAD MONK COMMENTED, “YOU ARE FULL OF THE SPRING.”\nCHOSA REPLIED, “BETTER THAN THE AUTUMN DEWS FALLING ON THE LOTUS LEAVES.”\nONE EVENING CHOSA (WHO WAS KYOZAN’S “UNCLE” IN THE DHARMA LINEAGE) WAS ENJOYING THE MOONLIGHT WITH KYOZAN, WHO SAID, “EVERYONE HAS ‘THIS ONE THING’ BUT DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO USE IT.”\nCHOSA REPLIED, “PERHAPS I SHOULD EMPLOY YOU AND USE IT.” KYOZAN EXCLAIMED, “TRY IT!”\nINSTANTLY, CHOSA TRAMPLED ON KYOZAN.\nKYOZAN THEN COMMENTED, “UNCLE, YOU ARE LIKE A FIERCE TIGER!”\nA small but very beautiful anecdote.\nZen always tries to beautify the ordinary; it gives greater meanings and implications to words of the ordinary world. So you have to remember that these statements not only say what you hear, but they say much which you can hear only in your silences.\nChosa had been strolling in the hills. When he returned, the head monk said, “Where have you been?”\nCHOSA SAID, “FIRST I WENT FOLLOWING THE FRAGRANT GRASSES...”\nThis is a way of saying that “First I was following only the very ordinary grasses and their fragrance – I thought this was immensely beautiful – AND NOW I HAVE RETURNED IN PURSUIT OF THE FALLING BLOSSOMS.”\nThe difference between the fragrant grasses and the falling blossoms is the same as the difference between you unaware, and you utterly full of light and awareness.\nThe distinction between the grasses and the blossoms is the same as between you not knowing that you are a buddha, and the moment you know that you are a buddha. You have always been a buddha. In fact, there is no way to be otherwise.\nBuddha is completely blossomed, fully opened. His lotuses, his petals, have come to a completion, a perfection beyond which it is difficult, almost impossible, to go.\nAT THIS THE HEAD MONK COMMENTED, “YOU ARE FULL OF THE SPRING.”\nA man of silence, a man who has been following the falling blossoms, also becomes part of the spring – the beautiful time when exotic flowers blossom with the fragrances of the beyond. Certainly he was full of spring.\nEvery day you experience it. Every day you become full of spring. I am trying my best to use the words only to indicate to you the path that is beyond the words. Whenever you are at the center of your being, blossoms start falling and you are full of spring – and a spring that has no beginning and no end.\nCHOSA REPLIED, “BETTER THAN THE AUTUMN DEWS FALLING ON THE LOTUS LEAVES.”\nCertainly, to be full of spring yourself is far more beautiful than the autumn dews falling on the lotus leaves. That is one of the most beautiful things to watch: when autumn dews fall on the lotus leaves and shine in the morning sun like real pearls.\nBut of course it is a momentary experience. As the sun rises, the autumn dews start evaporating. Soon there will be no autumn dews. A few will have evaporated into the air, a few will have slipped down from the leaves, to the ocean, but all will be gone within a few minutes.\nThis temporary beauty cannot be compared, certainly, with an eternal spring in your being. You look back as far as you can, and it has always been there. You look forward as much as you can, and you will be surprised: it is your very being. Wherever you are it will be there, and the flowers will continue to shower on you. This is spiritual spring.\nONE EVENING CHOSA (WHO WAS KYOZAN’S “UNCLE” IN THE DHARMA LINEAGE) WAS ENJOYING THE MOONLIGHT WITH KYOZAN, WHO SAID, “EVERYONE HAS ‘THIS ONE THING’.”\nWhat is this one thing that Kyozan mentioned? This one thing is your consciousness. Nothing can be said about it, because it is as invisible as the air. Nothing can be done to it, because it is born perfect.\nChosa’s comment was,\n“PERHAPS I SHOULD EMPLOY YOU AND USE IT.” KYOZAN SAID, “TRY IT!”\nINSTANTLY, CHOSA TRAMPLED ON KYOZAN.\nWhat can be the significance of Chosa trampling upon Kyozan?\nHe is saying, “This body that I am trampling, you are not. And this mind that is asking me to try it, you are not. But while I am trampling you, deep down I can see your witness. This witness is the one thing, the most important, the most significant – the only thing which is incomparable in the whole existence.”\nKYOZAN THEN COMMENTED, “UNCLE, YOU ARE LIKE A FIERCE TIGER!”\nObviously, he trampled on Kyozan to make it clear to him that “you are only the watcher.” And that is the only thing which cannot be said, cannot be explained, but can only be indicated. And the way he indicated it is the way of a tiger or a lion.\nMoritake wrote:\nA MORNING GLORY!\nAND SO, TODAY,\nMAY SEEM MY OWN LIFE STORY.\nThe morning glory is one of the most beautiful flowers – particularly in the Far East. And Moritake, an enlightened master, is saying:\n“A morning glory... it opens itself as the sun rises, as the birds start singing, as the whole atmosphere becomes cool with the morning breeze. And the morning glory has a tremendous perfume.”\nAND SO, TODAY,\nMAY SEEM MY OWN LIFE STORY.\nMoritake is saying, “The dark night of my soul has ended. The dawn that I have been searching for millions of lives has finally arrived. The sun is rising and the morning glory suddenly has opened and thrown its perfume to the breeze to take it as far away as possible.\n“It seems to me,” says Moritake, “this is my whole life story. My being has also come to a flowering, and in the very innermost core my sun has risen. The night is over and the day of my awakening has started. This day of awakening and awareness knows no end.”\nGautama the Buddha is reported to have said, “The night has no beginning, it is eternal, and the morning has no end – it is also eternal. The night is the past that has gone away, and the morning is that which is coming slowly, settling, settling forever.”\nQuestion 1 Maneesha has asked:\nBELOVED BUDDHA,\nSINCE YOU BECAME A HOST FOR GAUTAMA THE BUDDHA, YOU SEEM QUITE DIFFERENT TO ME, AND MEDITATING IN YOUR PHYSICAL PRESENCE IS ALSO DIFFERENT. IT IS NOT JUST THE IMPACT OF SEEING YOU AGAIN AFTER AN ABSENCE, BECAUSE THE FEELING HAS NOT DIMINISHED WITH TIME; NOR IS IT JUST MY FANTASY, BECAUSE OTHERS FEEL THE SAME WAY.\nYOUR LOVE SEEMS A LITTLE LESS LIKE A CUDDLE AND MORE LIKE A BOILING CAULDRON.\nManeesha, you were right before six o’clock this evening. Now your question is irrelevant. Okay?\nNivedano... (Drumbeat) (Gibberish) Nivedano... (Drumbeat)\nBe silent. Close your eyes. Feel your body to be completely frozen.\nNow, this is the moment to look inwards with your total consciousness, and with an urgency as if this is going to be your last moment in life.\nGo deeper. As you will be reaching deeper and deeper and deeper, closer to your center, you will find the buddha – not any buddha of the past, but your very being.\nEverybody is a born buddha, whether one remembers it or not. This is the moment to remember it! Because with the very remembrance of your being a buddha, a new world opens its doors.\nJust be a witness. Nivedano, make it clear... (Drumbeat)\nJust watch the body – it is not you. This is the body which can be trampled. Watch the mind – it is not you. The only quality that you can claim as your very being is witnessing. And witnessing makes you a buddha.\nGather as much as you can the silences of your heart, and the tremendous peace that has descended over you. The whole spring – gather it! And persuade the buddha to come along with you, to become your very breathing, to become your ordinary life.\nSooner or later there will not be anyone here who is not a buddha in his own right. Before Nivedano calls you, persuade the buddha.\nToday, it is not only to come and sit silently for a few minutes, but also to dance because I have declared myself Zorba The Buddha, which has been my basic approach to all human problems. This evening is far more significant than the evening four days before.\nCome back. Bring all your silence and joy and grace with you. Sit a few moments utterly full of spring.\nToday you have to stand up and dance with the music, because this is my last declaration. Okay, Maneesha?\nYes, Buddha.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2284","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/no_mind_the_flowers_of_eternity/part5/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/no_mind_the_flowers_of_eternity/>No Mind.

EXCLAIMED, “TRY IT!”</p><p>INSTANTLY, CHOSA TRAMPLED ON KYOZAN.</p><p><br></p><p>KYOZAN THEN COMMENTED, “UNCLE, YOU ARE LIKE A FIERCE TIGER!”</p><p><br></p><p>A small but very beautiful anecdote.</p><p><br></p><p>Zen always tries to beautify the ordinary; it gives greater meanings
and implications to words of the ordinary world. So you have to remember
that these statements not only say what you hear, but they say much
which you can hear only in your silences.</p><p><br></p><p>Chosa had been strolling in the hills. When he returned, the head
monk said, “Where have you been?”</p><p>CHOSA SAID, “FIRST I WENT FOLLOWING THE FRAGRANT GRASSES...”</p><p><br></p><p>This is a way of saying that “First I was following only the very
ordinary grasses and their fragrance – I thought this was immensely
beautiful – AND NOW I HAVE RETURNED IN PURSUIT OF THE FALLING
BLOSSOMS.”</p><p><br></p><p>The difference between the fragrant grasses and the falling blossoms
is the same as the difference between you unaware, and you utterly full
of light and awareness.</p><p><br></p><p>The distinction between the grasses and the blossoms is the same as
between you not knowing that you are a buddha, and the moment you know
that you are a buddha. You have always been a buddha. In fact, there is
no way to be otherwise.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha is completely blossomed, fully opened. His lotuses, his
petals, have come to a completion, a perfection beyond which it is
difficult, almost impossible, to go.</p><p><br></p><p>AT THIS THE HEAD MONK COMMENTED, “YOU ARE FULL OF THE SPRING.”</p><p><br></p><p>A man of silence, a man who has been following the falling blossoms,
also becomes part of the spring – the beautiful time when exotic flowers
blossom with the fragrances of the beyond. Certainly he was full of
spring.</p><p><br></p><p>Every day you experience it. Every day you become full of spring. I
am trying my best to use the words only to indicate to you the path that
is beyond the words. Whenever you are at the center of your being,
blossoms start falling and you are full of spring – and a spring that
has no beginning and no end.</p><p><br></p><p>CHOSA REPLIED, “BETTER THAN THE AUTUMN DEWS FALLING ON THE LOTUS
LEAVES.”</p><p><br></p><p>Certainly, to be full of spring yourself is far more beautiful than
the autumn dews falling on the lotus leaves. That is one of the most
beautiful things to watch: when autumn dews fall on the lotus leaves and
shine in the morning sun like real pearls.</p><p><br></p><p>But of course it is a momentary experience. As the sun rises, the
autumn dews start evaporating. Soon there will be no autumn dews. A few
will have evaporated into the air, a few will have slipped down from the
leaves, to the ocean, but all will be gone within a few minutes.</p><p><br></p><p>This temporary beauty cannot be compared, certainly, with an eternal
spring in your being. You look back as far as you can, and it has always
been there. You look forward as much as you can, and you will be
surprised: it is your very being. Wherever you are it will be there, and
the flowers will continue to shower on you. This is spiritual
spring.</p><p><br></p><p>ONE EVENING CHOSA (WHO WAS KYOZAN’S “UNCLE” IN THE DHARMA LINEAGE)
WAS ENJOYING THE MOONLIGHT WITH KYOZAN, WHO SAID, “EVERYONE HAS ‘THIS
ONE THING’.<span class=s4></span>”</p><p><br></p><p>What is this one thing that Kyozan mentioned? This one thing is your
consciousness. Nothing can be said about it, because it is as invisible
as the air. Nothing can be done to it, because it is born perfect.</p><p>Chosa’s comment was,</p><p><br></p><p>“PERHAPS I SHOULD EMPLOY YOU AND USE IT.” KYOZAN SAID, “TRY IT!”</p><p>INSTANTLY, CHOSA TRAMPLED ON KYOZAN.</p><p><br></p><p>What can be the significance of Chosa trampling upon Kyozan?</p><p><br></p><p>He is saying, “This body that I am trampling, you are not. And this
mind that is asking me to try it, you are not. But while I am trampling
you, deep down I can see your witness. This witness is the one thing,
the most important, the most significant – the only thing which is
incomparable in the whole existence.”</p><p><br></p><p>KYOZAN THEN COMMENTED, “UNCLE, YOU ARE LIKE A FIERCE TIGER!”</p><p><br></p><p>Obviously, he trampled on Kyozan to make it clear to him that “you
are only the watcher.” And that is the only thing which cannot be said,
cannot be explained, but can only be indicated. And the way he indicated
it is the way of a tiger or a lion.</p><p><br></p><p>Moritake wrote:</p><p><br></p><p>A MORNING GLORY!</p><p><br></p><p>AND SO, TODAY,</p><p><br></p><p>MAY SEEM MY OWN LIFE STORY.</p><p><br></p><p>The morning glory is one of the most beautiful flowers – particularly
in the Far East. And Moritake, an enlightened master, is saying:</p><p><br></p><p>“A morning glory... it opens itself as the sun rises, as the birds
start singing, as the whole atmosphere becomes cool with the morning
breeze. And the morning glory has a tremendous perfume.”</p><p><br></p><p>AND SO, TODAY,</p><p><br></p><p>MAY SEEM MY OWN LIFE STORY.</p><p><br></p><p>Moritake is saying, “The dark night of my soul has ended. The dawn
that I have been searching for millions of lives has finally arrived.
The sun is rising and the morning glory suddenly has opened and thrown
its perfume to the breeze to take it as far away as possible.</p><p><br></p><p>“It seems to me,” says Moritake, “this is my whole life story. My
being has also come to a flowering, and in the very innermost core my
sun has risen. The night is over and the day of my awakening has
started. This day of awakening and awareness knows no end.”</p><p>Gautama the Buddha is reported to have said, “The night has no
beginning, it is eternal, and the morning has no end – it is also
eternal. The night is the past that has gone away, and the morning is
that which is coming slowly, settling, settling forever.”</p><p><br></p><p>Question 1 Maneesha has asked:</p><p>BELOVED BUDDHA,</p><p><br></p><p>SINCE YOU BECAME A HOST FOR GAUTAMA THE BUDDHA, YOU SEEM QUITE
DIFFERENT TO ME, AND MEDITATING IN YOUR PHYSICAL PRESENCE IS ALSO
DIFFERENT. IT IS NOT JUST THE IMPACT OF SEEING YOU AGAIN AFTER AN
ABSENCE, BECAUSE THE FEELING HAS NOT DIMINISHED WITH TIME; NOR IS IT
JUST MY FANTASY, BECAUSE OTHERS FEEL THE SAME WAY.</p><p><br></p><p>YOUR LOVE SEEMS A LITTLE LESS LIKE A CUDDLE AND MORE LIKE A BOILING
CAULDRON.</p><p><br></p><p>Maneesha, you were right before six o’clock this evening. Now your
question is irrelevant. Okay?</p><p>Nivedano... (Drumbeat) (Gibberish) Nivedano... (Drumbeat)</p><p>Be silent. Close your eyes. Feel your body to be completely
frozen.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, this is the moment to look inwards with your total
consciousness, and with an urgency as if this is going to be your last
moment in life.</p><p><br></p><p>Go deeper. As you will be reaching deeper and deeper and deeper,
closer to your center, you will find the buddha – not any buddha of the
past, but your very being.</p><p><br></p><p>Everybody is a born buddha, whether one remembers it or not. This is
the moment to remember it! Because with the very remembrance of your
being a buddha, a new world opens its doors.</p><p>Just be a witness. Nivedano, make it clear... (Drumbeat)</p><p>Just watch the body – it is not you. This is the body which can be
trampled. Watch the mind – it is not you. The only quality that you can
claim as your very being is witnessing. And witnessing makes you a
buddha.</p><p><br></p><p>Gather as much as you can the silences of your heart, and the
tremendous peace that has descended over you. The whole spring – gather
it! And persuade the buddha to come along with you, to become your very
breathing, to become your ordinary life.</p><p><br></p><p>Sooner or later there will not be anyone here who is not a buddha in
his own right. Before Nivedano calls you, persuade the buddha.</p><p><br></p><p>Today, it is not only to come and sit silently for a few minutes, but
also to dance because I have declared myself Zorba The Buddha, which has
been my basic approach to all human problems. This evening is far more
significant than the evening four days before.</p><p><br></p><p>Come back. Bring all your silence and joy and grace with you. Sit a
few moments utterly full of spring.</p><p><br></p><p>Today you have to stand up and dance with the music, because this is
my last declaration. Okay, Maneesha?</p><p>Yes, Buddha.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part4>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

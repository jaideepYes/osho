Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BEING ONESELF AND BEING EGOLESS?
There is no difference between being oneself and being egoless. The difference is only in the expression. If you see it from the negative standpoint, egolessness will be the expression because ego disappears.
If you see it from the positive standpoint then being oneself will be the expression."><meta name=author content="Osho"><link rel=canonical href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_transmission_of_the_lamp/part43/><meta name=google-site-verification content="XYZabc"><meta name=yandex-verification content="XYZabc"><meta name=msvalidate.01 content="XYZabc"><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.b609c58d5c11bb90b1a54e04005d74ad1ddf22165eb79f5533967e57df9c3b50.css integrity="sha256-tgnFjVwRu5CxpU4EAF10rR3fIhZet59VM5Z+V9+cO1A=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=mask-icon href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_transmission_of_the_lamp/part43/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:title" content="43 The monkey is dead"><meta property="og:description" content="< Previous | Contents | Next >

The difference is only in the expression. If you see it from the negative standpoint, egolessness will be the expression because ego disappears.\nIf you see it from the positive standpoint then being oneself will be the expression.\nThey are just two ways of saying the same thing, but they are not two things so there is no distinction.\nAnd always remember that every experience can be expressed in two ways and they appear so different that it seems as if there are two things. And great thinkers have been quarreling about it, great philosophies have arisen out of the insistence that these are two things.\nFor example, Mahavira prefers to express it in the positive way, being oneself. Gautam Buddha prefers the negative way, egolessness. Both have their merits and demerits.\nWhen you say “being oneself” there is a danger that you may mistake your ego for your being. Being oneself may become your egoistic standpoint. That is dangerous.\nOn the other hand, describing the experience as egolessness has no challenge in it, no excitement in it. It is emptiness, nothingness, negativity. Very few people will be attracted towards the negative. The negative expression may close the doors for them. But the negative way has a beauty in that it will not allow in any way – from the front door or from the back door – the possibility of the ego.\nSo for the ignorant people, it is better to describe it as egolessness because they are accustomed to their ignorance.\nBut for those who know, being oneself does not mean ego; being oneself means egolessness, but it is only for those who know.\nMy own approach is that egolessness is the way to reach the experience of being oneself. So they don’t appear two, and both are combined, and the merits of both are together.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nYOU SPOKE THE OTHER MORNING IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION, ABOUT THE NEED FOR ENERGY TO BE EXPRESSED SEXUALLY; UNTIL THAT POINT, IF ONE SIMPLY TRIES TO DIVERT THE ENERGY INTO SPIRITUALITY IT WILL CREATE A BLOCK.\nON ANOTHER OCCASION YOU SPOKE OF RAMAKRISHNA AND HOW HE WOULD MEDITATE ON HIS WIFE’S NAKED BODY WHENEVER HE FELT SEXUALITY ARISING. WAS HE ALREADY ENLIGHTENED, OR WAS HE SIMPLY IN A STAGE OF CONSCIOUSNESS NOT COMPARABLE TO THE STATE THAT WAS ASKED ABOUT THE OTHER MORNING?\nHe was not enlightened, and whatever he was doing was a subtle way of repression. You do it by looking at a pornographic magazine – that looks ugly. He was doing it looking at his own wife, who was a beautiful woman. That doesn’t seem to be ugly, but it is living pornography.\nAnd Ramakrishna was not enlightened at that point, and he became more and more repressed. That repression was coming into his mad dances before the god, singing for hours – that was simply expressing energy that he had been repressing.\nHe became enlightened only in the end when he came in contact with a master. The name of the master was Totapuri. After that he never worshipped his wife in her naked form, after that he never worshipped even the mother goddess of the temple in which he was the priest, after that he became a totally different man – all worshipping, all singing, all dancing disappeared. He became utterly silent, peaceful, but tremendously radiant, playful, blissful.\nThe meeting with the master changed his whole life.\nThe followers of Ramakrishna don’t give much space in their books, in their biographies of Ramakrishna, to the meeting of Totapuri and Ramakrishna – because after that, Ramakrishna was such a different man that the ordinary religious man will not find any appeal in him. He finds great appeal in the old Ramakrishna – in his devotional songs and dances and rituals before the goddess, and his whole life of a devotee.\nRamakrishna was fortunate to find a master, but he was not fortunate enough to find disciples. And the meeting with the master happened in the very last days of his life.\nSo the followers of Ramakrishna go on thinking about the old Ramakrishna who was unenlightened; and the disciples who started the Ramakrishna mission, they also talk about the long life of Ramakrishna, his teachings, his devotion. But nobody mentions that the real Ramakrishna was born after Totapuri’s meeting, in fact they want to avoid that fact.\nI have been in contact with his disciples. They feel a little embarrassed that Ramakrishna had to be a disciple to a master, that only then he became enlightened. They simply don’t want that part. They would like Ramakrishna himself to be the origin, the source of a new tradition – the Ramakrishna order.\nAnd in Bengal there a thousands of sannyasins who belong to the Ramakrishna order, and there are many more who are not monks but who are deeply devoted to Ramakrishna – but they are all concerned with the WRONG Ramakrishna. And whenever I said this they were very much shocked.\nIn the beginning they used to call me to speak at their conferences, and when I started focusing on this point they stopped inviting me – because I was destroying their whole joy. They were not people who wanted to sit silently doing nothing, and the spring comes and the grass grows by itself. They wanted chanting, ritual, dancing, an image of God, a belief in God.\nAnd Ramakrishna, before he became enlightened, had believed in all these things; but before he died he dropped everything. That small period is the only important period in his life.\nBut that is very empty, utterly silent. It is only for those who are seekers of silence, serenity, truth. Question 3\nBELOVED OSHO,\nAS I WAS WRITING TODAY, I REALIZED THAT ALL MY QUESTIONS COME TO THE SAME POINT: IS THIS REALLY ME? IS THIS AUTHENTIC? IS THIS MY TRUTH? THE REAL BURNING QUESTION IS: WHO AM I? SOMETIMES I FEEL THAT I AM NEVER GOING TO KNOW IF THIS MIND CONTINUES TO CREATE BARRIERS OF NONSENSE. AT OTHER TIMES I DO FEEL THAT I AM COMING CLOSER. I DON’T EVEN KNOW WHAT MY QUESTION IS, BUT COULD YOU PLEASE ANSWER IT?\nI know, and you know too, what your question is. I know the answer. You also know the answer. But my answer will only become a belief in you. I would rather like to help you to find the answer within yourself – that will be authentic.\nYou want to know who you are. This is the basic question everybody wants to know.\nAnd the barrier is not big. The barrier is not great. You have just not tried what I have been continually telling you to try – watch your thoughts whenever you have time, or whenever you are doing something then watch the doing, watch the doer.\nThe whole point is that your capacity to watch should increase. You will become more and more a clear watcher, and the thoughts will disappear.\nThoughts are very poor. They don’t have their own life. You give them life because you don’t watch them. If you watch them, they start disappearing – because the life of thoughts is your identifying with them. You think, “These are my thoughts.” They are not your thoughts, not a single thought is yours. Only watchfulness is yours. All thoughts come to you from outside.\nIf you simply remain watchful, just as they come they will go, and slowly, slowly they will come less and less. They don’t like to come uninvited. They don’t like to come when you don’t welcome them. And when your whole energy is centered in watching, there is no energy left for thoughts to move on the screen of your mind, they simply stop.\nAnd the moment thoughts are not there, the answer is. That answer will not come in words, the answer will come as an experience.\nQuestion 4 BELOVED OSHO,\nA NURSE, WORKING IN A HOSPITAL WITH SMALL DISABLED AND BACKWARD CHILDREN, TOLD ME OF THE FOLLOWING CASE WHICH SHE HAD TO TAKE CARE OF.\nTHERE WAS A SMALL BOY ABOUT FOUR YEARS OLD WHO WAS CONFINED IN A BED – NOT ONLY WITH COT SIDES BUT WITH BARS ACROSS THE TOP TOO – LIKE A CAGE. HE WAS VERY SMALL FOR HIS AGE, UNABLE TO SPEAK OR WALK OR EVEN TO SIT. HE WAS FAIR-SKINNED AND WAS COVERED ALL OVER HIS BODY WITH LONG, DARK BROWN HAIR, AND WAS ALWAYS HANGING BY HIS HANDS AND FEET FROM THE ROOF OF HIS CAGE, MAKING SOUNDS LIKE A MONKEY. HE REFUSED ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT FOODS EXCEPT BANANAS – HE ATE NOTHING ELSE; HOWEVER, HE WAS A VERY HAPPY AND FRIENDLY CHILD. EARLY MAN LOOKED SIMILAR TO MONKEYS, AND MODERN MAN OFTEN BEHAVES LIKE A MONKEY. WOULD YOU PLEASE COMMENT ON THIS?\nThe behavior of a monkey is the behavior of a frantic mind jumping from here to there, from this branch to that branch, never stable, never able to sit silently even for a few moments, always doing something, always going somewhere, continuous in activity – meaningless or meaningful, relevant or irrelevant.\nCharles Darwin’s theory may be right or wrong; most probably it is wrong – because for thousands of years we have been seeing no monkey come down from the trees and start walking like a man. And why did only a small bunch of monkeys change into man and the remaining monkeys stay as monkeys for millions of years? Did it not dawn in their minds that their cousins , their brothers, their sisters, their in-laws have progressed so much and they are still hanging in the trees?\nThat’s why I say most probably Darwin’s theory is not right, not factually right; but psychologically it seems to have some validity.\nMan’s mind is a monkey. If you watch your mind you can see. It is never quiet. The most difficult thing for it is not to do anything.\nBut a few men have managed to get out of this monkey mind and have been able to remain inactive as long as they wanted.\nIn the East for centuries all the mystics have agreed on one point: that if the mind can remain silent for forty-eight minutes non-stop you are free of its grip. Then you can eat as many bananas as you want! You will not go bananas. But for forty-eight seconds the mind cannot remain still, what to say about forty-eight minutes!\nAnd this is the whole work of a spiritual seeker, to change the monkey mind and bring it into a state of stillness. Perhaps that is the last stage of evolution.\nThere are stones which have life, though it is very dormant – because they grow. Then there are trees which have life – and recent research says they have sensitivity too. Then there are animals of thousands of species. They have a certain kind of intelligence also. And then man is there. He has more intelligence than anybody else in the known world.\nIf he can use this intelligence to help the monkey to be still, to relax, then the supermind comes into being and you have a clarity that was never before, a clarity that makes you aware of yourself and aware of existence that surrounds you, and fills you with tremendous gratitude.\nOtherwise, Darwin may not be factually right but psychologically he is right. Looking at man, anybody could have predicted that somehow he is related to the monkeys.\nWhen I used to travel in India for many years continually I was almost always on the train, on the plane, in the car, just traveling, moving. The train was the only place for me to rest. Once I got out of the train there was no possibility of rest – five, six meetings per day, colleges, universities, conferences, friends, journalists, press conferences. It was impossible. The only place for me to rest was the railway train. After twenty years continually traveling I could not sleep because the whole noise of the train and its wheels and the people coming and going and railway stations and hawkers and people shouting and all that – was missing. You will be surprised to know that I had to record it on a tape recorder, so when I go to bed they will put on the tape recorder and just listening to it I will go into a perfect sleep. Then they will remove the tape recorder. Otherwise it was difficult, I will toss and turn. Twenty years is a long time, and it became such a habit.\nMostly I was in an air-conditioned coupe for only two people, and because I was so tired I had no desire to talk to the other person or to answer his questions.\nOne day in Amritsar I entered the train. And the man was looking out of the window. Thousands of people had come to see me off. So he was getting very curious. As I went in, he touched my feet. I said, “Just sit down. You are too curious. This is my name. This is my father’s name. I have so many brothers, so many sisters, one sister has died. My father has so many brothers, so many sisters, both his sisters have died. My grandfather...”\nHe said, “But I am not asking these things.”\nI said, “You will ask. Rather than wasting time, I am simply giving you all information possible so that after that just forgive me, forget me, and let me rest, don’t ask anything. I give you five minutes, you can ask me anything you want.”\nHe said, “I don’t want. You are a strange person. I have never seen such a person. I have not said anything. You give me your name, your brothers, your sisters, your father, your uncle, your aunts, their children, your grandfather.”\nI said, “So you are satisfied?”\nHe said, “I am satisfied, perfectly satisfied.”\nSo I said, “That’s okay. Now I am going to rest. No questions any more.”\nBut that man was boiling. These were not the questions he was interested in. He wanted to know what these people had come for, and what is my teaching; but now he has said that he was perfectly satisfied and we had settled that there would be no more questions.\nAnd I rested and looked at him and I could see his trouble. He will open his box, look into it and close it and put it back; open a book, look into it and then put it down again – just to do something. He will go into the bathroom, and just come out. And I knew that he was not doing anything – even in the bathroom he was unnecessarily going in and coming out. And I simply sat there watching him, and that made him more mad because he knew that I am seeing him and whatever he is doing is stupid, there is no need for it. Again he is opening his suitcase for no reason. He will start reading the newspaper he had read from the morning – and it was evening. He must have been reading a morning newspaper the whole day, and again he will see and close it and put it aside because he has read it.\nFinally he said, “Call the servant and ask where the conductor is. I want to change this room.”\nThe servant said, “But what is the trouble in this room? You will not find such a silent room anywhere.”\nHe said, “That is the trouble. This man has completely silenced me. I cannot speak in words. And it is driving me crazy; I am going into the bathroom and there I have nothing to do, and I come back again, and open the suitcase, but I don’t have any reason to open it. And this man is strange. He is simply sitting there and looking at me. If he was not looking, it would be okay; but just with his watching and my stupid behavior, I simply want to go into some other room.” He said, “Let the conductor come.”\nThe conductor came and he said, “What is the trouble? – because rooms are full; we can ask somebody to exchange the place.”\nI said, “There is no problem. I can exchange. I can sit on his seat, he can sit on my seat.”\nThe conductor said, “So simple. The solution is right now here. Why are you worried? Just change the seat.”\nHe said, “You don’t understand anything. This man is the trouble, and it will not make any difference, from that seat he will create trouble.”\nThe conductor said, “This man has been traveling for years, and I know him. He has not created trouble for anyone.”\nHe said, “How to explain? He is not doing anything. He has simply stopped asking anything, and without asking, without a little chit-chat, a little conversation, I am getting crazy. And his watching is driving me nuts, and now this – he will be sitting on my seat, I will be sitting on his seat – this makes no difference.”\nThe conductor said, “This is beyond me. I don’t understand.” He asked me, “Do you understand?”\nI said, “I don’t understand, because this man is a very good man and he has not done any nuisance. He simply does a few innocent things – opens his suitcase, closes his suitcase, for no reason. But it is his suitcase, he can open it as many times as he wants, I am not going to prevent. I know he is opening it uselessly, but it is his suitcase. He goes to the bathroom; there is no problem for me, he can go as many times as he wants. He can read the same newspaper as many times as he wants. He can open the book and close the book. He can do all these exercises that he is doing. I have no objection. Why is he so much worried?”\nBut the man simply packed all his luggage and got out and said to the conductor, “You have to find me some place; otherwise I can go even to the first class, no need for air conditioning, because to live with this man for twenty-four hours” – the journey was twenty-four hours – “I will not be reaching home alive; my heart is beating so fast. And this is true – that he has not done anything except tell me his name, his father’s name”\nThe conductor said, “But this is harmless. He was simply introducing.”\nBut he wouldn’t enter the room. He escaped. He said, “Wherever I can get into the train I will, but I cannot enter into his room.”\nI said, “That is very good. That is all I wanted. Now I can rest. And don’t send anybody else in this room because the same will happen.”\nThe conductor said, “This isYou have not done anything and this man is out of the compartment,\nand he has paid for the air-conditioned class.”\nMan is very frantic, he just goes on doing something or other – arranging the furniture again and again in the room, putting things from here and there even though they are not needed that way – but he cannot simply sit silently. And that is the only thing to learn, just not being on the tree does not make any difference.\nSit silently.\nOnly a man in deep meditation goes beyond monkeyhood, for the first time becomes really human. Question\nBELOVED OSHO,\nTEN YEARS AGO WHEN I FIRST STRUGGLED THROUGH DYNAMIC, IT WAS SO OUTRAGEOUS THAT I EXPECTED IMMEDIATE RESULTS IN THE FORM OF AMAZING, PSYCHEDELIC, SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCES. I HAD ALMOST GIVEN UP AND WAS ABOUT TO ASK FOR MY MONEY BACK ON THE THIRD DAY, WHEN LO AND BEHOLD, STARS EXPLODED BEFORE MY EYES! “MY GOD, IT REALLY WORKS,” I THOUGHT, AND WONDERED IF I NEED BOTHER TO FINISH THE TEN-DAY COURSE, OR IF THAT WAS IT. WHEN I REMOVED MY BLINDFOLD, I REALIZED THAT THIS – MY FIRST AND LAST GREAT SPIRITUAL HAPPENING – WAS SIMPLY THE RESULT OF A TOO-TIGHT ELASTIC ON MY BLINDFOLD. I HAVE ONLY NOW REALIZED THAT SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THEN AND NOW I HAVE STOPPED EXPECTING THE UNIVERSE TO EXPLODE OVER MY HEAD AT ANY MINUTE. IT IS SO EXQUISITE JUST TO SIT AT YOUR FEET, AND MELT AND SOAR... VERY, VERY QUIETLY. IS THIS JUST A SYMPTOM OF MIDDLE AGE?\nNo, it is not a symptom of middle age. It is a symptom of maturity, a symptom of deep understanding. Spirituality is not something exotic, some outrageous experience, some psychedelic explosion of colors and stars.\nSpirituality is a very innocent state of consciousness where nothing happens, just time comes to a standstill, all desires are gone, there is no longing, no ambition. This very moment becomes all.\nAnd this is not a symptom of middle age. The word ‘middle age’ is derogatory.\nOn the spiritual path nobody ever comes across it. On the contrary, one becomes a child – reborn, simple, trusting, eyes full of wonder. Every small thing – flowers, butterflies, birds – is a mystery. You are surrounded with the miraculous in your pure innocence and joy. It is not excitement. It is a very silent and peaceful joy. It is not feverish. There is a dance in it, but it is invisible. You can feel it deep at the very center of your being, but there is no movement.\nSo what is happening now is the right thing, just allow it – don’t condemn it by calling it middle age. It is the return of your childhood. You are being born again, it is a rebirth.\nQuestion 5 BELOVED OSHO,\nTHE OTHER DAY I WAS IN A BLACK HOLE; THERE WAS ONLY GREAT HOLLOWNESS – NO WAY TO GET OUT. I SAID TO MYSELF, “GO TO YOUR BED AND JUST BE WITH IT.” I WENT TO MY ROOM AND LAY ON MY BED, AND I DEEPLY FELT THAT I WANTED TO DIE. AT THE SAME MOMENT SUDDENLY THE BED BROKE AND I HIT MY HEAD ON THE WALL. I WAS THROWN TO THE FLOOR.\nOSHO, DID YOU DO THAT? IT HURT ME, BUT THE BLACK HOLE WAS GONE!\nNaturally. Who else would do it? If somebody else had done it then your head would not have hit and the black hole would not have gone. Your bed may have broken, you may have fallen on the floor, but you would have been in an even bigger black hole. If the black hole is gone, then it must be me – there is no doubt about it.\nQuestion 6 BELOVED OSHO,\nFOR MORE THAN TWO MONTHS YOU HAVE NOT BEEN OUT OF THIS HOUSE, AND YOU SEEM TO ENJOY SO MUCH WHAT I WOULD CALL A BORING LIFE.\nOSHO, WHAT MAKES IT SO HARD FOR US – AND SOMETIMES SO SCARY – TO FACE THOSE FEELINGS OF EMPTINESS, HOLLOWNESS, LONELINESS? IS THE DESIRE FOR EXCITEMENT JUST TO HIDE THIS EMPTINESS?\nAvesh, if one is happy with oneself, centered, there is no need to go anywhere because you cannot find any place better than your own inner being. All the restaurants, the movie houses, the casinos, are visited by very poor people, who have lost contact with themselves. They don’t know that they have a space within themselves which is the most beautiful and the most delicious.\nCertainly anybody looking at me will think that this must be a boring life. I can live in my room for lives. I don’t see any point of going anywhere – because what you are seeking I have found, and I have found it within myself. And you will go on seeking everywhere in the world and you will not find it.\nTo you, certainly it will seem that if you were to live in one room you will feel bored; but as far as I am concerned, even the idea of going out has not arisen in me. I simply enjoy myself so deeply and so greatly that I cannot conceive that there can be any place which can make me more than what I am.\nI have been around the world. I have been in millions of houses and hotels and... but it doesn’t matter, I am always myself wherever I am. And because I am blissful wherever I am, the place becomes blissful for me.\nIn Crete one Greek journalist was asking me – because he had seen me in Poona, he had seen me in Oregon, and now he was interviewing me in Crete – “Osho, how do you manage always to find a paradise?”\nI said, “It is not a question of finding a paradise. It is a question of carrying it within yourself so wherever you are it is there. And if you don’t have it within you, you cannot find it anywhere else. There is only one place where it exists and it is within you. It has no concern with houses, no concern with places. And if you get bored, that simply means you were hoping to find it here and you have not found it so you are bored, so you are thinking to go somewhere else to find it. There you don’t find it so you again get bored, and life starts becoming more and more boring. As you become older it becomes sheer boredom because slowly you start realizing that paradise does not exist anywhere. And the miracle is: all this time you have been carrying it within yourself. You can\ngo to the moon, but you will not go within yourself; you cannot believe it, ‘Within me and paradise? Impossible!’\n“You have been conditioned to hate yourself, to condemn yourself, to reject yourself. ‘Within me? And paradise?’”\nSo from the outset, rejection. You never go in.\nJust give it a little try. I am not preventing you... if you have found your paradise, still you can go to the restaurants, there is no harm; still you can go to the movie houses, still you can go to the casinos, there is no harm. But you will not feel bored anywhere.\nIn America in the jail, every jailer in five jails continually, sooner or later was puzzled that I was taking things with such ease. And they asked me, “You don’t seem to be disturbed. It seems clearly that the government wants to humiliate you but you are not humiliated, you are perfectly enjoying it.”\nI said, “It does not matter. I am myself wherever I am – in jail or in a palace. I don’t change. My inner space remains the same. Nobody can humiliate me. Nobody can make me miserable.”\nIn fact, just the reverse happened. When I left the first jail – where I lived the longest – there were tears in the eyes of the jailer. And he said, “We will miss you. I would like you to remain with us. You have changed the whole flavor of the jail.”\nI was in the hospital section, and most of the time I was sitting in the nurse’s room or the doctor’s room. And all the authorities of the jail were coming and asking questions. And the head nurse told me, “This has never happened. These big people, great authorities, they never come. Once in a month for a visit they come for two minutes. And now six times a day the jailer comes, the doctor comes, everybody comes, everybody has their spiritual problems, and you have made it a school.”\nOne nurse was very much interested because she had done an M.A. in philosophy, and she said, “This is my first chance to talk with someone who will understand my problems. I cannot talk to anybody in this jail. After doing my M.A. I joined and became a nurse here. I can neither say what I know, nor can I say what my questions are. You are the first person.” She will not even take her off-days, she will continue to come.\nAnd they were so happy that for three days continuously I have been with them... they will always remember. And they were cutting my photos from newspapers and taking my signature and the date to keep as a memory.\nBut I said, “Do you do this with other prisoners?”\nThey said, “We cannot conceive of you as a prisoner. We can only conceive of you as our guest.”\nThe question is not where you are. The question is whether you know yourself or not. If you know, then every place is paradise. If you don’t know, then every place is hell and sooner or later boredom is bound to arise.\nSo by changing places you cannot escape boredom, it will follow you like a shadow. It is by changing your consciousness that you can get rid of all possibility of boredom.\nIt is your question that reminded me that yes, for two months I have not been out. I had not even thought about it. I simply come to see you and rejoice with you, and then go and remain in my room – just myself. I don’t have to open boxes and open books. The monkey is dead.\nQuestion 7 BELOVED OSHO,\nWHY DO PEOPLE BUG OUR TELEPHONES EVERYWHERE WE GO? ARE THEY LOOKING FOR SPIRITUAL GUIDANCE ON THE CHEAP?\nCertainly. Let them have it. We have nothing to hide. They can come and be here and enjoy, but poor people! – they feel embarrassed to come so they bug.\nSo whenever you are phoning just put in a few spiritual things for the buggers! Question 8\nBELOVED OSHO,\nTO HAVE A HOT LOVER IS SOMETHING, BUT TO HAVE A HOT MASTER IS REALLY SOMETHING ELSE! WHAT DO YOU SAY?\nIt is a very difficult question. Geeta understood it. It is something else, because hot masters have never been there. It is a totally new experience. Hot lovers have always been there, but hot lovers get cold very soon. You cannot depend on them.\nBut a hot master is a hot master.\nIn fact I have to keep myself continuously air conditioned!\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"5115","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_transmission_of_the_lamp/part43/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_transmission_of_the_lamp/>The Transmission of the Lamp</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">43 The monkey is dead</h1><div class=post-meta>25 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;5115 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Transmission_of_the_Lamp/part43.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part42>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

The
difference is only in the expression. If you see it from the negative
standpoint, egolessness will be the expression because ego
disappears.</p><p><br></p><p>If you see it from the positive standpoint then being oneself will be
the expression.</p><p><br></p><p>They are just two ways of saying the same thing, but they are not two
things so there is no distinction.</p><p><br></p><p>And always remember that every experience can be expressed in two
ways and they appear so different that it seems as if there are two
things. And great thinkers have been quarreling about it, great
philosophies have arisen out of the insistence that these are two
things.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, Mahavira prefers to express it in the positive way,
being oneself. Gautam Buddha prefers the negative way, egolessness. Both
have their merits and demerits.</p><p><br></p><p>When you say “being oneself” there is a danger that you may mistake
your ego for your being. Being oneself may become your egoistic
standpoint. That is dangerous.</p><p>On the other hand, describing the experience as egolessness has no
challenge in it, no excitement in it. It is emptiness, nothingness,
negativity. Very few people will be attracted towards the negative. The
negative expression may close the doors for them. But the negative way
has a beauty in that it will not allow in any way – from the front door
or from the back door – the possibility of the ego.</p><p><br></p><p>So for the ignorant people, it is better to describe it as
egolessness because they are accustomed to their ignorance.</p><p><br></p><p>But for those who know, being oneself does not mean ego; being
oneself means egolessness, but it is only for those who know.</p><p><br></p><p>My own approach is that egolessness is the way to reach the
experience of being oneself. So they don’t appear two, and both are
combined, and the merits of both are together.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>YOU SPOKE THE OTHER MORNING IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION, ABOUT THE NEED
FOR ENERGY TO BE EXPRESSED SEXUALLY; UNTIL THAT POINT, IF ONE SIMPLY
TRIES TO DIVERT THE ENERGY INTO SPIRITUALITY IT WILL CREATE A BLOCK.</p><p><br></p><p>ON ANOTHER OCCASION YOU SPOKE OF RAMAKRISHNA AND HOW HE WOULD
MEDITATE ON HIS WIFE’S NAKED BODY WHENEVER HE FELT SEXUALITY ARISING.
WAS HE ALREADY ENLIGHTENED, OR WAS HE SIMPLY IN A STAGE OF CONSCIOUSNESS
NOT COMPARABLE TO THE STATE THAT WAS ASKED ABOUT THE OTHER MORNING?</p><p><br></p><p>He was not enlightened, and whatever he was doing was a subtle way of
repression. You do it by looking at a pornographic magazine – that looks
ugly. He was doing it looking at his own wife, who was a beautiful
woman. That doesn’t seem to be ugly, but it is living pornography.</p><p><br></p><p>And Ramakrishna was not enlightened at that point, and he became more
and more repressed. That repression was coming into his mad dances
before the god, singing for hours – that was simply expressing energy
that he had been repressing.</p><p><br></p><p>He became enlightened only in the end when he came in contact with a
master. The name of the master was Totapuri. After that he never
worshipped his wife in her naked form, after that he never worshipped
even the mother goddess of the temple in which he was the priest, after
that he became a totally different man – all worshipping, all singing,
all dancing disappeared. He became utterly silent, peaceful, but
tremendously radiant, playful, blissful.</p><p><br></p><p>The meeting with the master changed his whole life.</p><p><br></p><p>The followers of Ramakrishna don’t give much space in their books, in
their biographies of Ramakrishna, to the meeting of Totapuri and
Ramakrishna – because after that, Ramakrishna was such a different man
that the ordinary religious man will not find any appeal in him. He
finds great appeal in the old Ramakrishna – in his devotional songs and
dances and rituals before the goddess, and his whole life of a
devotee.</p><p>Ramakrishna was fortunate to find a master, but he was not fortunate
enough to find disciples. And the meeting with the master happened in
the very last days of his life.</p><p>So the followers of Ramakrishna go on thinking about the old
Ramakrishna who was unenlightened; and the disciples who started the
Ramakrishna mission, they also talk about the long life of Ramakrishna,
his teachings, his devotion. But nobody mentions that the real
Ramakrishna was born after Totapuri’s meeting, in fact they want to
avoid that fact.</p><p><br></p><p>I have been in contact with his disciples. They feel a little
embarrassed that Ramakrishna had to be a disciple to a master, that only
then he became enlightened. They simply don’t want that part. They would
like Ramakrishna himself to be the origin, the source of a new tradition
– the Ramakrishna order.</p><p><br></p><p>And in Bengal there a thousands of sannyasins who belong to the
Ramakrishna order, and there are many more who are not monks but who are
deeply devoted to Ramakrishna – but they are all concerned with the
WRONG Ramakrishna. And whenever I said this they were very much
shocked.</p><p><br></p><p>In the beginning they used to call me to speak at their conferences,
and when I started focusing on this point they stopped inviting me –
because I was destroying their whole joy. They were not people who
wanted to sit silently doing nothing, and the spring comes and the grass
grows by itself. They wanted chanting, ritual, dancing, an image of God,
a belief in God.</p><p><br></p><p>And Ramakrishna, before he became enlightened, had believed in all
these things; but before he died he dropped everything. That small
period is the only important period in his life.</p><p><br></p><p>But that is very empty, utterly silent. It is only for those who are
seekers of silence, serenity, truth. Question 3</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>AS I WAS WRITING TODAY, I REALIZED THAT ALL MY QUESTIONS COME TO THE
SAME POINT: IS THIS REALLY ME? IS THIS AUTHENTIC? IS THIS MY TRUTH? THE
REAL BURNING QUESTION IS: WHO AM I? SOMETIMES I FEEL THAT I AM NEVER
GOING TO KNOW IF THIS MIND CONTINUES TO CREATE BARRIERS OF NONSENSE. AT
OTHER TIMES I DO FEEL THAT I AM COMING CLOSER. I DON’T EVEN KNOW WHAT MY
QUESTION IS, BUT COULD YOU PLEASE ANSWER IT?</p><p><br></p><p>I know, and you know too, what your question is. I know the answer.
You also know the answer. But my answer will only become a belief in
you. I would rather like to help you to find the answer within yourself
– that will be authentic.</p><p><br></p><p>You want to know who you are. This is the basic question everybody
wants to know.</p><p><br></p><p>And the barrier is not big. The barrier is not great. You have just
not tried what I have been continually telling you to try – watch your
thoughts whenever you have time, or whenever you are doing something
then watch the doing, watch the doer.</p><p>The whole point is that your capacity to watch should increase. You
will become more and more a clear watcher, and the thoughts will
disappear.</p><p><br></p><p>Thoughts are very poor. They don’t have their own life. You give them
life because you don’t watch them. If you watch them, they start
disappearing – because the life of thoughts is your identifying with
them. You think, “These are my thoughts.” They are not your thoughts,
not a single thought is yours. Only watchfulness is yours. All thoughts
come to you from outside.</p><p><br></p><p>If you simply remain watchful, just as they come they will go, and
slowly, slowly they will come less and less. They don’t like to come
uninvited. They don’t like to come when you don’t welcome them. And when
your whole energy is centered in watching, there is no energy left for
thoughts to move on the screen of your mind, they simply stop.</p><p><br></p><p>And the moment thoughts are not there, the answer is. That answer
will not come in words, the answer will come as an experience.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 4 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>A NURSE, WORKING IN A HOSPITAL WITH SMALL DISABLED AND BACKWARD
CHILDREN, TOLD ME OF THE FOLLOWING CASE WHICH SHE HAD TO TAKE CARE
OF.</p><p><br></p><p>THERE WAS A SMALL BOY ABOUT FOUR YEARS OLD WHO WAS CONFINED IN A BED
– NOT ONLY WITH COT SIDES BUT WITH BARS ACROSS THE TOP TOO – LIKE A
CAGE. HE WAS VERY SMALL FOR HIS AGE, UNABLE TO SPEAK OR WALK OR EVEN TO
SIT. HE WAS FAIR-SKINNED AND WAS COVERED ALL OVER HIS BODY WITH LONG,
DARK BROWN HAIR, AND WAS ALWAYS HANGING BY HIS HANDS AND FEET FROM THE
ROOF OF HIS CAGE, MAKING SOUNDS LIKE A MONKEY. HE REFUSED ALL KINDS OF
DIFFERENT FOODS EXCEPT BANANAS – HE ATE NOTHING ELSE; HOWEVER, HE WAS A
VERY HAPPY AND FRIENDLY CHILD. EARLY MAN LOOKED SIMILAR TO MONKEYS, AND
MODERN MAN OFTEN BEHAVES LIKE A MONKEY. WOULD YOU PLEASE COMMENT ON
THIS?</p><p><br></p><p>The behavior of a monkey is the behavior of a frantic mind jumping
from here to there, from this branch to that branch, never stable, never
able to sit silently even for a few moments, always doing something,
always going somewhere, continuous in activity – meaningless or
meaningful, relevant or irrelevant.</p><p><br></p><p>Charles Darwin’s theory may be right or wrong; most probably it is
wrong – because for thousands of years we have been seeing no monkey
come down from the trees and start walking like a man. And why did only
a small bunch of monkeys change into man and the remaining monkeys stay
as monkeys for millions of years? Did it not dawn in their minds that
their cousins , their brothers, their sisters, their in-laws have
progressed so much and they are still hanging in the trees?</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why I say most probably Darwin’s theory is not right, not
factually right; but psychologically it seems to have some validity.</p><p>Man’s mind is a monkey. If you watch your mind you can see. It is
never quiet. The most difficult thing for it is not to do anything.</p><p><br></p><p>But a few men have managed to get out of this monkey mind and have
been able to remain inactive as long as they wanted.</p><p><br></p><p>In the East for centuries all the mystics have agreed on one point:
that if the mind can remain silent for forty-eight minutes non-stop you
are free of its grip. Then you can eat as many bananas as you want! You
will not go bananas. But for forty-eight seconds the mind cannot remain
still, what to say about forty-eight minutes!</p><p><br></p><p>And this is the whole work of a spiritual seeker, to change the
monkey mind and bring it into a state of stillness. Perhaps that is the
last stage of evolution.</p><p><br></p><p>There are stones which have life, though it is very dormant – because
they grow. Then there are trees which have life – and recent research
says they have sensitivity too. Then there are animals of thousands of
species. They have a certain kind of intelligence also. And then man is
there. He has more intelligence than anybody else in the known
world.</p><p><br></p><p>If he can use this intelligence to help the monkey to be still, to
relax, then the supermind comes into being and you have a clarity that
was never before, a clarity that makes you aware of yourself and aware
of existence that surrounds you, and fills you with tremendous
gratitude.</p><p><br></p><p>Otherwise, Darwin may not be factually right but psychologically he
is right. Looking at man, anybody could have predicted that somehow he
is related to the monkeys.</p><p><br></p><p>When I used to travel in India for many years continually I was
almost always on the train, on the plane, in the car, just traveling,
moving. The train was the only place for me to rest. Once I got out of
the train there was no possibility of rest – five, six meetings per day,
colleges, universities, conferences, friends, journalists, press
conferences. It was impossible. The only place for me to rest was the
railway train. After twenty years continually traveling I could not
sleep because the whole noise of the train and its wheels and the people
coming and going and railway stations and hawkers and people shouting
and all that – was missing. You will be surprised to know that I had to
record it on a tape recorder, so when I go to bed they will put on the
tape recorder and just listening to it I will go into a perfect sleep.
Then they will remove the tape recorder. Otherwise it was difficult, I
will toss and turn. Twenty years is a long time, and it became such a
habit.</p><p><br></p><p>Mostly I was in an air-conditioned coupe for only two people, and
because I was so tired I had no desire to talk to the other person or to
answer his questions.</p><p><br></p><p>One day in Amritsar I entered the train. And the man was looking out
of the window. Thousands of people had come to see me off. So he was
getting very curious. As I went in, he touched my feet. I said, “Just
sit down. You are too curious. This is my name. This is my father’s
name. I have so many brothers, so many sisters, one sister has died. My
father has so many brothers, so many sisters, both his sisters have
died. My grandfather...”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “But I am not asking these things.”</p><p>I said, “You will ask. Rather than wasting time, I am simply giving
you all information possible so that after that just forgive me, forget
me, and let me rest, don’t ask anything. I give you five minutes, you
can ask me anything you want.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I don’t want. You are a strange person. I have never seen
such a person. I have not said anything. You give me your name, your
brothers, your sisters, your father, your uncle, your aunts, their
children, your grandfather.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “So you are satisfied?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I am satisfied, perfectly satisfied.”</p><p><br></p><p>So I said, “That’s okay. Now I am going to rest. No questions any
more.”</p><p><br></p><p>But that man was boiling. These were not the questions he was
interested in. He wanted to know what these people had come for, and
what is my teaching; but now he has said that he was perfectly satisfied
and we had settled that there would be no more questions.</p><p><br></p><p>And I rested and looked at him and I could see his trouble. He will
open his box, look into it and close it and put it back; open a book,
look into it and then put it down again – just to do something. He will
go into the bathroom, and just come out. And I knew that he was not
doing anything – even in the bathroom he was unnecessarily going in and
coming out. And I simply sat there watching him, and that made him more
mad because he knew that I am seeing him and whatever he is doing is
stupid, there is no need for it. Again he is opening his suitcase for no
reason. He will start reading the newspaper he had read from the morning
– and it was evening. He must have been reading a morning newspaper the
whole day, and again he will see and close it and put it aside because
he has read it.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally he said, “Call the servant and ask where the conductor is. I
want to change this room.”</p><p><br></p><p>The servant said, “But what is the trouble in this room? You will not
find such a silent room anywhere.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “That is the trouble. This man has completely silenced me. I
cannot speak in words. And it is driving me crazy; I am going into the
bathroom and there I have nothing to do, and I come back again, and open
the suitcase, but I don’t have any reason to open it. And this man is
strange. He is simply sitting there and looking at me. If he was not
looking, it would be okay; but just with his watching and my stupid
behavior, I simply want to go into some other room.” He said, “Let the
conductor come.”</p><p><br></p><p>The conductor came and he said, “What is the trouble? – because rooms
are full; we can ask somebody to exchange the place.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “There is no problem. I can exchange. I can sit on his seat,
he can sit on my seat.”</p><p><br></p><p>The conductor said, “So simple. The solution is right now here. Why
are you worried? Just change the seat.”</p><p>He said, “You don’t understand anything. This man is the trouble, and
it will not make any difference, from that seat he will create
trouble.”</p><p><br></p><p>The conductor said, “This man has been traveling for years, and I
know him. He has not created trouble for anyone.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “How to explain? He is not doing anything. He has simply
stopped asking anything, and without asking, without a little chit-chat,
a little conversation, I am getting crazy. And his watching is driving
me nuts, and now this – he will be sitting on my seat, I will be sitting
on his seat – this makes no difference.”</p><p><br></p><p>The conductor said, “This is beyond me. I don’t understand.” He asked
me, “Do you understand?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I don’t understand, because this man is a very good man and
he has not done any nuisance. He simply does a few innocent things –
opens his suitcase, closes his suitcase, for no reason. But it is his
suitcase, he can open it as many times as he wants, I am not going to
prevent. I know he is opening it uselessly, but it is his suitcase. He
goes to the bathroom; there is no problem for me, he can go as many
times as he wants. He can read the same newspaper as many times as he
wants. He can open the book and close the book. He can do all these
exercises that he is doing. I have no objection. Why is he so much
worried?”</p><p><br></p><p>But the man simply packed all his luggage and got out and said to the
conductor, “You have to find me some place; otherwise I can go even to
the first class, no need for air conditioning, because to live with this
man for twenty-four hours” – the journey was twenty-four hours – “I will
not be reaching home alive; my heart is beating so fast. And this is
true – that he has not done anything except tell me his name, his
father’s name<span class=s4></span>”</p><p><br></p><p>The conductor said, “But this is harmless. He was simply
introducing.”</p><p><br></p><p>But he wouldn’t enter the room. He escaped. He said, “Wherever I can
get into the train I will, but I cannot enter into his room.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “That is very good. That is all I wanted. Now I can rest. And
don’t send anybody else in this room because the same will happen.”</p><p><br></p><p>The conductor said, “This is<span class=s4></span>You have not done
anything and this man is out of the compartment,</p><p>and he has paid for the air-conditioned class.”</p><p><br></p><p>Man is very frantic, he just goes on doing something or other –
arranging the furniture again and again in the room, putting things from
here and there even though they are not needed that way – but he cannot
simply sit silently. And that is the only thing to learn, just not being
on the tree does not make any difference.</p><p><br></p><p>Sit silently.</p><p>Only a man in deep meditation goes beyond monkeyhood, for the first
time becomes really human. Question</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>TEN YEARS AGO WHEN I FIRST STRUGGLED THROUGH DYNAMIC, IT WAS SO
OUTRAGEOUS THAT I EXPECTED IMMEDIATE RESULTS IN THE FORM OF AMAZING,
PSYCHEDELIC, SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCES. I HAD ALMOST GIVEN UP AND WAS ABOUT
TO ASK FOR MY MONEY BACK ON THE THIRD DAY, WHEN LO AND BEHOLD, STARS
EXPLODED BEFORE MY EYES! “MY GOD, IT REALLY WORKS,” I THOUGHT, AND
WONDERED IF I NEED BOTHER TO FINISH THE TEN-DAY COURSE, OR IF THAT WAS
IT. WHEN I REMOVED MY BLINDFOLD, I REALIZED THAT THIS – MY FIRST AND
LAST GREAT SPIRITUAL HAPPENING – WAS SIMPLY THE RESULT OF A TOO-TIGHT
ELASTIC ON MY BLINDFOLD. I HAVE ONLY NOW REALIZED THAT SOMEWHERE BETWEEN
THEN AND NOW I HAVE STOPPED EXPECTING THE UNIVERSE TO EXPLODE OVER MY
HEAD AT ANY MINUTE. IT IS SO EXQUISITE JUST TO SIT AT YOUR FEET, AND
MELT AND SOAR... VERY, VERY QUIETLY. IS THIS JUST A SYMPTOM OF MIDDLE
AGE?</p><p><br></p><p>No, it is not a symptom of middle age. It is a symptom of maturity, a
symptom of deep understanding. Spirituality is not something exotic,
some outrageous experience, some psychedelic explosion of colors and
stars.</p><p><br></p><p>Spirituality is a very innocent state of consciousness where nothing
happens, just time comes to a standstill, all desires are gone, there is
no longing, no ambition. This very moment becomes all.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is not a symptom of middle age. The word ‘middle age’ is
derogatory.</p><p>On the spiritual path nobody ever comes across it. On the contrary,
one becomes a child – reborn, simple, trusting, eyes full of wonder.
Every small thing – flowers, butterflies, birds – is a mystery. You are
surrounded with the miraculous in your pure innocence and joy. It is not
excitement. It is a very silent and peaceful joy. It is not feverish.
There is a dance in it, but it is invisible. You can feel it deep at the
very center of your being, but there is no movement.</p><p><br></p><p>So what is happening now is the right thing, just allow it – don’t
condemn it by calling it middle age. It is the return of your childhood.
You are being born again, it is a rebirth.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 5 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>THE OTHER DAY I WAS IN A BLACK HOLE; THERE WAS ONLY GREAT HOLLOWNESS
– NO WAY TO GET OUT. I SAID TO MYSELF, “GO TO YOUR BED AND JUST BE WITH
IT.” I WENT TO MY ROOM AND LAY ON MY BED, AND I DEEPLY FELT THAT I
WANTED TO DIE. AT THE SAME MOMENT SUDDENLY THE BED BROKE AND I HIT MY
HEAD ON THE WALL. I WAS THROWN TO THE FLOOR.</p><p><br></p><p>OSHO, DID YOU DO THAT? IT HURT ME, BUT THE BLACK HOLE WAS GONE!</p><p>Naturally. Who else would do it? If somebody else had done it then
your head would not have hit and the black hole would not have gone.
Your bed may have broken, you may have fallen on the floor, but you
would have been in an even bigger black hole. If the black hole is gone,
then it must be me – there is no doubt about it.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 6 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>FOR MORE THAN TWO MONTHS YOU HAVE NOT BEEN OUT OF THIS HOUSE, AND YOU
SEEM TO ENJOY SO MUCH WHAT I WOULD CALL A BORING LIFE.</p><p><br></p><p>OSHO, WHAT MAKES IT SO HARD FOR US – AND SOMETIMES SO SCARY – TO FACE
THOSE FEELINGS OF EMPTINESS, HOLLOWNESS, LONELINESS? IS THE DESIRE FOR
EXCITEMENT JUST TO HIDE THIS EMPTINESS?</p><p><br></p><p>Avesh, if one is happy with oneself, centered, there is no need to go
anywhere because you cannot find any place better than your own inner
being. All the restaurants, the movie houses, the casinos, are visited
by very poor people, who have lost contact with themselves. They don’t
know that they have a space within themselves which is the most
beautiful and the most delicious.</p><p><br></p><p>Certainly anybody looking at me will think that this must be a boring
life. I can live in my room for lives. I don’t see any point of going
anywhere – because what you are seeking I have found, and I have found
it within myself. And you will go on seeking everywhere in the world and
you will not find it.</p><p><br></p><p>To you, certainly it will seem that if you were to live in one room
you will feel bored; but as far as I am concerned, even the idea of
going out has not arisen in me. I simply enjoy myself so deeply and so
greatly that I cannot conceive that there can be any place which can
make me more than what I am.</p><p><br></p><p>I have been around the world. I have been in millions of houses and
hotels and... but it doesn’t matter, I am always myself wherever I am.
And because I am blissful wherever I am, the place becomes blissful for
me.</p><p><br></p><p>In Crete one Greek journalist was asking me – because he had seen me
in Poona, he had seen me in Oregon, and now he was interviewing me in
Crete – “Osho, how do you manage always to find a paradise?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “It is not a question of finding a paradise. It is a question
of carrying it within yourself so wherever you are it is there. And if
you don’t have it within you, you cannot find it anywhere else. There is
only one place where it exists and it is within you. It has no concern
with houses, no concern with places. And if you get bored, that simply
means you were hoping to find it here and you have not found it so you
are bored, so you are thinking to go somewhere else to find it. There
you don’t find it so you again get bored, and life starts becoming more
and more boring. As you become older it becomes sheer boredom because
slowly you start realizing that paradise does not exist anywhere. And
the miracle is: all this time you have been carrying it within yourself.
You can</p><p>go to the moon, but you will not go within yourself; you cannot
believe it, ‘Within me and paradise? Impossible!’</p><p><br></p><p>“You have been conditioned to hate yourself, to condemn yourself, to
reject yourself. ‘Within me? And paradise?’”</p><p><br></p><p>So from the outset, rejection. You never go in.</p><p><br></p><p>Just give it a little try. I am not preventing you... if you have
found your paradise, still you can go to the restaurants, there is no
harm; still you can go to the movie houses, still you can go to the
casinos, there is no harm. But you will not feel bored anywhere.</p><p><br></p><p>In America in the jail, every jailer in five jails continually,
sooner or later was puzzled that I was taking things with such ease. And
they asked me, “You don’t seem to be disturbed. It seems clearly that
the government wants to humiliate you but you are not humiliated, you
are perfectly enjoying it.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “It does not matter. I am myself wherever I am – in jail or
in a palace. I don’t change. My inner space remains the same. Nobody can
humiliate me. Nobody can make me miserable.”</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, just the reverse happened. When I left the first jail –
where I lived the longest – there were tears in the eyes of the jailer.
And he said, “We will miss you. I would like you to remain with us. You
have changed the whole flavor of the jail.”</p><p><br></p><p>I was in the hospital section, and most of the time I was sitting in
the nurse’s room or the doctor’s room. And all the authorities of the
jail were coming and asking questions. And the head nurse told me, “This
has never happened. These big people, great authorities, they never
come. Once in a month for a visit they come for two minutes. And now six
times a day the jailer comes, the doctor comes, everybody comes,
everybody has their spiritual problems, and you have made it a
school.”</p><p><br></p><p>One nurse was very much interested because she had done an M.A. in
philosophy, and she said, “This is my first chance to talk with someone
who will understand my problems. I cannot talk to anybody in this jail.
After doing my M.A. I joined and became a nurse here. I can neither say
what I know, nor can I say what my questions are. You are the first
person.” She will not even take her off-days, she will continue to
come.</p><p><br></p><p>And they were so happy that for three days continuously I have been
with them... they will always remember. And they were cutting my photos
from newspapers and taking my signature and the date to keep as a
memory.</p><p><br></p><p>But I said, “Do you do this with other prisoners?”</p><p><br></p><p>They said, “We cannot conceive of you as a prisoner. We can only
conceive of you as our guest.”</p><p><br></p><p>The question is not where you are. The question is whether you know
yourself or not. If you know, then every place is paradise. If you don’t
know, then every place is hell and sooner or later boredom is bound to
arise.</p><p>So by changing places you cannot escape boredom, it will follow you
like a shadow. It is by changing your consciousness that you can get rid
of all possibility of boredom.</p><p><br></p><p>It is your question that reminded me that yes, for two months I have
not been out. I had not even thought about it. I simply come to see you
and rejoice with you, and then go and remain in my room – just myself. I
don’t have to open boxes and open books. The monkey is dead.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 7 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>WHY DO PEOPLE BUG OUR TELEPHONES EVERYWHERE WE GO? ARE THEY LOOKING
FOR SPIRITUAL GUIDANCE ON THE CHEAP?</p><p><br></p><p>Certainly. Let them have it. We have nothing to hide. They can come
and be here and enjoy, but poor people! – they feel embarrassed to come
so they bug.</p><p><br></p><p>So whenever you are phoning just put in a few spiritual things for
the buggers! Question 8</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>TO HAVE A HOT LOVER IS SOMETHING, BUT TO HAVE A HOT MASTER IS REALLY
SOMETHING ELSE! WHAT DO YOU SAY?</p><p><br></p><p>It is a very difficult question. Geeta understood it. It is something
else, because hot masters have never been there. It is a totally new
experience. Hot lovers have always been there, but hot lovers get cold
very soon. You cannot depend on them.</p><p><br></p><p>But a hot master is a hot master.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact I have to keep myself continuously air conditioned!</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part42>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
EACH NEW ERA OF THE LAST FEW CENTURIES HAS AFTER A SLOW START EMERGED VERY SUDDENLY – THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION AND THE ERA OF COMMUNICATIONS ARE TWO OBVIOUS EXAMPLES.

AND THE SUSPENSE OF WAITING FOR THE PENNY TO DROP IS SIMPLY BREATHTAKING.\nWHEN THE OBVIOUS BECOMES SUDDENLY OBVIOUS, I THINK WE ARE GOING TO SEE AN EXPLOSION OF INTENSE INTEREST IN YOU AND ALL THE INNER BEAUTIES YOU HAVE FOR SO LONG BEEN POINTING AT – AND THE WORLD WILL BE TRANSFORMED FOREVER.\nOSHO, IS THIS POSSIBLE?\nIt is possible, and evolution happens only in this way. First, things go very slowly, then they start accumulating momentum, speed, and a point is reached when the speed and momentum are so much that it becomes explosive.\nThe days of waiting are long, the nights of patience seem to be unending – but they end, the morning comes.\nWhat is happening here around me will gather speed and momentum soon. It is only a question of how deep our waiting is, how patient our silence is, because the darkness has no force.\nReligions have created a very stupid idea in the mind of man, that evil has force. Evil has no force. There is no such thing as evil. Truth has force and energy – a mountain of lies cannot prevent it – it just takes time for it to grow.\nIt cannot be stopped, it cannot be hindered, the ultimate explosion is absolutely certain. Man has to become superman.\nConsciousness has to reach to the world of superconsciousness.\nAnd blessed are those who can wait, who can be silently watching the door when the guest comes. The guest certainly comes, has never failed. And there are no evil forces working against the truth, working against the forces of good.\nIt is only darkness, ignorance – you cannot call them forces. You have to be compassionate towards them, they are not enemies, they are just like big blocks of marble waiting for a right sculptor to cut a few chips here, a few chips there, and a hidden beautiful statue, which was always there, emerges. The artist only helps that which was hidden to emerge. Nobody is preventing it.\nBut the idea that evil is working against the forces of good has made people impatient, and afraid too.\nI say unto you there is no evil, and there are no evil forces in the world. There are only people of awareness and there are people who are fast asleep – and sleep has no force. The whole energy is in the hands of the awakened people. And one awakened person can awaken the whole world. One lighted candle can make millions of candles lighted, without losing its light.\nAnd the time is not far away, because the sleeping humanity has suffered much and is going to suffer more, and as the suffering grows deeper... it is a blessing in disguise. Man can tolerate only a certain quantity of suffering, and then he wakes up. And man has suffered enough.\nBefore this century ends we will see the emergence of the superman. Question 2\nBELOVED OSHO,\nIS THERE A PLACE FOR HYPNOSIS OF THE VERY YOUNG? IT OCCURS TO ME THAT IF CHILDREN WERE HYPNOTIZED AT THE FIRST STAGE OF THEIR BEING COGNITIVE, THERE WOULD BE ALL KINDS OF RAMIFICATIONS WHICH WOULD ONLY BE TREMENDOUSLY BENEFICIAL.\nTHEY COULD BECOME AWARE OF THEIR PAST LIVES AND THUS, OF ANY SELF-DEFEATING PATTERNS THEY WERE CAUGHT UP IN. THEY COULD GAIN AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHY THEY WERE BORN IN A PARTICULAR FAMILY, TO CERTAIN PARENTS. THEY COULD PERIODICALLY, THROUGH HYPNOSIS, BE CLEANED OF THE ACCUMULATED UNCONSCIOUS MOTIVATIONS FOR FUTURE NEUROSIS. AND ABOVE ALL, THEY COULD DISCOVER WHERE THEIR PARTICULAR POTENTIALITIES LAY, AND THUS DIRECT THEIR LIVES MORE CONSCIOUSLY.\nYOU HAVE TOLD US OF THE YOUNG GIRL FOR WHOM THE RECOLLECTION OF A PREVIOUS LIFE PROVED TRAUMATIC, BUT IF HYPNOSIS WERE CONDUCTED UNDER THE RIGHT SUPERVISION, WITH THE RIGHT GUIDANCE, IT COULD PROVE THE KEY TO A WHOLE NEW GENERATION OF PEOPLE.\nWOULD YOU PLEASE COMMENT?\nHypnosis is a very powerful method, and one has to be always aware that it can do immense good, but it can also do immense harm. The question is, in whose hands is the power?\nYou are right that hypnosis can help children immensely in every direction: in maturity, in individuality, in freedom, in meditation, in education, in intelligence, in memory. It can help them, but it can also harm them.\nIf the power is in the wrong hands the same hypnosis can be used to enslave people, to destroy their individuality, to destroy even the idea of freedom; to convince them that they are born slaves and they will remain slaves and that to revolt is simply risking their lives.\nSo the whole question depends on whose hands hypnosis is in. Right now I will not suggest it, because society is in the wrong hands and the society is causing every wrong to be planted in human beings. But hypnosis can be of tremendous help to them.\nI would certainly suggest that children of sannyasins can be helped, but before anybody starts helping children, he should go through the whole process himself, so he is acquainted with the terrain, and knows where there are pitfalls.\nWe cannot use it yet with the masses. One day, when the whole world is a little more alert, the children can be benefited inconceivably, but right now you have to confine yourself first to sannyasins, and secondly to their children, and you have to be very aware of what you are doing, because children are very delicate. Nothing wrong should reach their minds.\nAnd hypnosis takes things deep into the unconscious. It is a tremendously powerful method, and can bring great joys to children – and multidimensionally. In education: if a child is lagging behind, he can be supported by hypnosis and the same child will be in the front. If in a certain subject the child is finding difficulties, those difficulties can be removed just by suggestions in hypnosis.\nIf you want to learn a new language, it is always more difficult as you grow older – for children it is not difficult, they can be molded very easily. Each child should be made capable of learning the international language through hypnosis. The other language he will be learning in the routine way.\nHe can become more independent, he can become more loving – all ugly things like jealousy, anger, hatred can be removed completely. Competition, ambition, he will never know. And all the energy that goes into jealousy, anger, hatred, competition, ambition, can be focused towards a certain talent. That talent also can be discovered in hypnosis; otherwise it is very difficult – almost impossible – to find out what talent a child has, what genius he has. We know only when a person has expressed his genius. We do not know millions of others who have died without expressing themselves, because they had no opportunity, no situation supporting them, and every kind of hindrance. And they themselves had no idea what was their destiny, what they were meant to be.\nHypnosis can discover first what the child is meant to be, and then redirect the energies from all wrong sources towards the creative talent. So on the one hand, wrong expressions, ugly expressions disappear, which create only misery and poison for the child and for others, and on the other hand, all that energy becomes his creative expression.\nAnd one thing should be remembered as a fundamental rule: if a person finds a way to express himself, in tune with his destiny, he will be always joyous. He will be bubbling with happiness. He has found the right path, but again I would like you to remember, it cannot be done with the masses.\nThese methods should be kept confined to the world of sannyasins, so we can show to the world, “You can see our children, and you can see your children, and you can see the difference.”\nSeventy percent of diseases are mind-oriented. Through hypnosis those diseases can be prevented before they occur. Through hypnosis it can be found out what kind of sickness is going to happen in the near future. There are no symptoms on the body, the routine physical examination of the person will not show any indication that he is going to be sick or ill, he is perfectly healthy.\nBut through hypnosis we can find that within three weeks he is going to fall sick, because before anything comes to the body, it comes from the deep cosmic unconscious. It travels from there to the collective unconscious, to the unconscious, and only then, when it comes to the conscious mind, can it be checked and found in the body.\nSicknesses can be prevented even before the person has any idea that he is going to be sick.\nIn Russia, one genius photographer, Kirlian, has even photographed peopleHis whole life he has\nbeen working in photography, with very sensitive plates, sensitive lenses, to find something which is not available to ordinary eyes and ordinary instruments. And he was puzzled that he can see in his photographs at least six months ahead.\nIf he takes a picture of a rosebud with his special sensitive plates, the picture is not of a rosebud, the picture is of a rose. Tomorrow it is going to be a rose. No other camera can do that miracle.\nFirst he himself was puzzled how the sensitive plate can take a picture of something which has not happened yet – and when tomorrow the bud opens up, it is exactly similar to the photograph, there is no difference at all.\nThen he discovered more and more that there is a certain aura surrounding the bud – just an energy aura, and that energy aura has the whole program of how the bud is going to open. The sensitive plate gets the picture of the energy aura that we cannot see with our bare eyes. Then he started working on diseases, and in Soviet medicine he has created a revolution.\nYou need not first become sick, and then be cured. You can be cured even before you had any knowledge of any sickness, because Kirlian photography will show in what part the sickness is going to show, because the energy aura will be sick, already sick. It is six months ahead. It is connected with your cosmic unconscious.\nThrough hypnosis and deeper experiments with it, you can find sicknesses that are going to happen and they can be treated. The children can be more happy. It has been a topic of concern to the psychoanalysts why all over the world, except in a few places, seventy years has become the routine idea of the length of life, because there are a few tribes in Kashmir, in India – now that part has been occupied by Pakistan, a very small part – where people have always lived one hundred and thirty years, one hundred and forty years, one hundred and fifty, and even at the age of one hundred and fifty they were as energetic as any young man. They never became old, they remained young until they died.\nIn Soviet Russia, in the Caucasus, from where Joseph Stalin came and George Gurdjieff came.… The Caucasus has produced really strong men. There is a small part where people live even to one hundred and eighty years. There are thousands of people who have passed one hundred and fifty.\nOne of my friends was working there and he asked a farmer, who was tilling the ground, “How old are you?”\nHe counted on his fingers, because he was uneducated. He said, “It must be nearabout one hundred and eighty.”\nMy friend could not believe it – one hundred and eighty! – and he is still young.\nHe enquired in the town and they said, “He is right. His father lived for two hundred years and we hope that he will also live two hundred years, because no sign of death can be seen.”\nPsychologists have been concerned to find the reason why in a few places people live long and in most of the world people live only the routine seventy years.\nGeorge Bernard Shaw, when he became seventy years old, moved away from London. His friends said, “What are you doing? In old age it is better to be here with friends, society – and you are a man of society, a man of culture.”\nHe said, “I cannot live here. I am now seventy. This society believes that people die at seventy and that belief is dangerous. I am going to find some place where people don’t believe such a thing.”\nAnd he found a small village nearby, and the way he went to find out was to go into graveyards and look on the stones for how long people had been living; and on a stone he found in one graveyard it said that the man had lived one hundred and twenty years. And the graveyard stone was saying, “He died an untimely death at the age of one hundred and twenty years.”\nHe said, “This is the place to live, where people think that somebody dying at one hundred and twenty is untimely.” And he lived there, and he lived long. He managed to live a century. And in that graveyard that was the case; on all the stones nobody had died at seventy.\nIt seems to be that it is just a psychological programming. For centuries we have been programmed... seven decades and you are finished. That has gone so deep that you die, not because your body is not capable of living, but because your psychology insists, “Follow the routine. Follow the crowd.” And in everything else you are following the crowd, so naturally you follow the crowd psychology in this too.\nScientists say that man’s body is capable of living at least three hundred years. Just as it goes on rejuvenating itself for seventy years, in fact it can go on for three hundred years, but the program has to be changed. Scientists think in a different way how to change the program, and it will take very long for them. They think the program is in the cells of the body.\nSo unless we split the human cell, just as we have been able to split the atom, and reprogram it, which seems to be far away, because even the scratch work has not started.…\nBut my understanding is that there is no need to go through physiology, you can go through psychology. If your hypnosis goes deep enough... the more you go into it, if it becomes an every day thing, slowly, slowly you will touch the cosmic unconscious and there is the real programming, you can change it.\nOur children can live longer, our children can live healthier, our children can live without old age. All this is possible, and we have to make it, to show to the world, but it is dangerous in the sense that if politicians get hold of hypnotic methods they are going to use it for their own purposes.\nNow in the Soviet Union every child has to be born in the hospital. Nobody is allowed for his child to be born in his own house, with friends, with warmth – no, that is illegal. There is a danger that if the child is from the very beginning in the hands of the bureaucrats, they can implant an electrode in the head of any child, or all children, and that electrode in the head can be controlled from far away – remote control.\nIt can be helpful, but not in these ugly politicians’ hands. They are going to make dangerous use of that. No revolution would be possible, because your mind would no more be in your own control. It has never been, but at least you had the idea that your mind is free – it never was. It was Christian, it was Hindu, it was Mohammedan – it was never free.\nBut there was a possibility, because the old method of conditioning the mind was a very long process; but putting an electrode in the mind is a simple process, and the control is in the hands of the government, or it can be in the hands of a computer.\nIt can enslave people, it can force people to go to fight – it can do anything, and you will feel that you are doing it.\nThe same is the thing with hypnosis. Even without electrodes children are in the hands of the government. In the schools they could enforce one hour of hypnotic sessions for every child, and\nthey could manage to program it in any way they want: that there is no soul, there is no evolution, that man is only matter.\nThen all efforts of searching for truth would disappear.\nSo we have to use these methods with our own children, and we have to be very cautious that these methods are not made available to politicians. Once anything is in their hands they are going to exploit it. And this is the greatest thing – man’s whole personality is just in their fist.\nThey will never allow the children to have individuality, or any love for freedom, or any desire to be creative. They would like them to be servile. That’s why I am calling this a mystery school. We will work as a school, and once we start different schools in different countries, I have to make you aware about many things that have to come, that they should not be made public. At least their basic secrets should not be made public; they should remain in the hands of your school. Anybody who wants to go through the transformation has to come to the school, so that governments cannot start using them for their own vested interests.\nQuestion 3 BELOVED OSHO,\nIT IS SAID THAT IF ONE TRAVELS AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT, ONE DISAPPEARS, AND WHEN ONE IS ENLIGHTENED, ONE ALSO DISAPPEARS.\nIS THERE ANY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO?\nThere is – from two different sides. They come to a meeting point in the middle. If somebody travels at the speed of light, he will become light, because the speed of light is so tremendous, it will burn anything. Scientists have been thinking to make some kind of vehicle which can travel with the speed of light, but the question is of what metal to make it, because at that speed everything will burn.\nWe don’t have anything yet, unless science manages to create something synthetic. Up to now there is no hope, it is only theoretical. Even at lesser speeds things burn.\nYou see every night stars falling; they are not stars – if a star falls on the earth, the earth is finished – they are stones. Stones from when the earth was liquid and was solidifying and was moving as fast as it is moving now. Any liquid thing if it moves will throw off many parts. Liquid parts will get off and be thrown away.\nThe moon is part of the earth – when it was very liquid a big chunk fell off. These big oceans – Pacific, Atlantic – are just places from where pieces of the earth have been thrown off. But when big things like the moon were being thrown off, many small stones were also being thrown off, and they have been roaming through space for millions of years.\nWhenever they come close to earth – that is, the earth’s gravitation which extends two hundred miles from the surface of the earth into the skyIf they come within a two-hundred-mile radius, then the\nearth pulls them and the pull is so much, and they run so fast towards earth, that they burn up on the way. That’s what you see when you say, “A star has fallen.” And at least thousands of stars fall every night, all around the earth. Sometimes a stone is so big that even though it burns, it reaches to the earth.\nThe stone in the Kaaba, which Mohammedans worship, is such a stone – it is not of the earth, and that’s why it became special, because nowhere on the earth can that kind of stone be found. It burnt but it fell. Mostly they never reach the earth, and this is not the speed of light.\nThe speed of light is tremendous – it is the ultimate speed. In one second light travels one hundred and eighty-six thousand miles. Multiply it by sixty, that will be how far it goes in one minute. Multiply it by sixty again, that will be how far in one hour. Multiply it by twenty-four, that will be how far in one day. And multiply it by three hundred and sixty-five, that will be how far in one year, and that is the smallest measurement of distance in space.\nSo distance is measured in years, light years – how many light years a certain star is away. For example the sun is nearabout ten light minutes away from the earth. Even ten minutesSo if a\ncertain thing moves with that speed, it is bound to disappear.\nAnd the question is that the enlightened person also disappears. The enlightened person disappears through a totally different process, but his disappearance and calling that disappearance enlightenment, as if his being has become light, certainly means that after enlightenment he has the speed of light. He is not trying to move at the speed of light, his disappearance is from a different process of awakening, but when he disappears that disappearance has been described by all the mystics in terms of light.\nI must have come across hundreds of mystics describing it as if suddenly thousands of suns have risen within you. That is a common expression in the mystic’s language, in all languages, in different countries, in different races. So although the disappearance happens from a different process, the ultimate peak is that the whole being becomes light. And certainly light always travels with the same speed.\nSo either you travel with the same speed and you will disappear, or you disappear and you will be traveling with the speed of light. Traveling with the speed of light is the work science has to do, and disappearing through being aware is the work that religion has to do.\nAnd there is the meeting point. Coming from different routes, but coming to the same peak, to the same experience.\nThere is certainly a deep relationship between the two experiences but their processes are different.

VERY SUDDENLY – THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION AND THE ERA OF COMMUNICATIONS
ARE TWO OBVIOUS EXAMPLES.</p><p><br></p><p>BEING WITH YOU I ALWAYS HAVE THE FEELING THAT WE ARE SITTING AROUND A
WARM COSY FIRESIDE, AT THE FEET OF THE MAN WHO INVENTED FIRE, WHILE ALL
AROUND ARE THE HOWLS OF AGONY AT THE ICY WORLD EVERYBODY ELSE IS
ENDURING.</p><p><br></p><p>AS MAN SCRAMBLES TO EXAMINE EVERY NOOK AND CRANNY OF THE WORLD ABOUT
HIM, FROM THE DEEPEST OCEAN TO THE FARTHEST STAR, THE ABSENCE OF ANYBODY
LOOKING INTO MAN HIMSELF IS BECOMING SO PERVERSE THAT THE SILENCE IS
DEAFENING. AND THE SUSPENSE OF WAITING FOR THE PENNY TO DROP IS SIMPLY
BREATHTAKING.</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN THE OBVIOUS BECOMES SUDDENLY OBVIOUS, I THINK WE ARE GOING TO
SEE AN EXPLOSION OF INTENSE INTEREST IN YOU AND ALL THE INNER BEAUTIES
YOU HAVE FOR SO LONG BEEN POINTING AT – AND THE WORLD WILL BE
TRANSFORMED FOREVER.</p><p><br></p><p>OSHO, IS THIS POSSIBLE?</p><p>It is possible, and evolution happens only in this way. First, things
go very slowly, then they start accumulating momentum, speed, and a
point is reached when the speed and momentum are so much that it becomes
explosive.</p><p><br></p><p>The days of waiting are long, the nights of patience seem to be
unending – but they end, the morning comes.</p><p><br></p><p>What is happening here around me will gather speed and momentum soon.
It is only a question of how deep our waiting is, how patient our
silence is, because the darkness has no force.</p><p><br></p><p>Religions have created a very stupid idea in the mind of man, that
evil has force. Evil has no force. There is no such thing as evil. Truth
has force and energy – a mountain of lies cannot prevent it – it just
takes time for it to grow.</p><p><br></p><p>It cannot be stopped, it cannot be hindered, the ultimate explosion
is absolutely certain. Man has to become superman.</p><p>Consciousness has to reach to the world of superconsciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>And blessed are those who can wait, who can be silently watching the
door when the guest comes. The guest certainly comes, has never failed.
And there are no evil forces working against the truth, working against
the forces of good.</p><p><br></p><p>It is only darkness, ignorance – you cannot call them forces. You
have to be compassionate towards them, they are not enemies, they are
just like big blocks of marble waiting for a right sculptor to cut a few
chips here, a few chips there, and a hidden beautiful statue, which was
always there, emerges. The artist only helps that which was hidden to
emerge. Nobody is preventing it.</p><p><br></p><p>But the idea that evil is working against the forces of good has made
people impatient, and afraid too.</p><p><br></p><p>I say unto you there is no evil, and there are no evil forces in the
world. There are only people of awareness and there are people who are
fast asleep – and sleep has no force. The whole energy is in the hands
of the awakened people. And one awakened person can awaken the whole
world. One lighted candle can make millions of candles lighted, without
losing its light.</p><p><br></p><p>And the time is not far away, because the sleeping humanity has
suffered much and is going to suffer more, and as the suffering grows
deeper... it is a blessing in disguise. Man can tolerate only a certain
quantity of suffering, and then he wakes up. And man has suffered
enough.</p><p><br></p><p>Before this century ends we will see the emergence of the superman.
Question 2</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>IS THERE A PLACE FOR HYPNOSIS OF THE VERY YOUNG? IT OCCURS TO ME THAT
IF CHILDREN WERE HYPNOTIZED AT THE FIRST STAGE OF THEIR BEING COGNITIVE,
THERE WOULD BE ALL KINDS OF RAMIFICATIONS WHICH WOULD ONLY BE
TREMENDOUSLY BENEFICIAL.</p><p><br></p><p>THEY COULD BECOME AWARE OF THEIR PAST LIVES AND THUS, OF ANY
SELF-DEFEATING PATTERNS THEY WERE CAUGHT UP IN. THEY COULD GAIN AN
UNDERSTANDING OF WHY THEY WERE BORN IN A PARTICULAR FAMILY, TO CERTAIN
PARENTS. THEY COULD PERIODICALLY, THROUGH HYPNOSIS, BE CLEANED OF THE
ACCUMULATED UNCONSCIOUS MOTIVATIONS FOR FUTURE NEUROSIS. AND ABOVE ALL,
THEY COULD DISCOVER WHERE THEIR PARTICULAR POTENTIALITIES LAY, AND THUS
DIRECT THEIR LIVES MORE CONSCIOUSLY.</p><p><br></p><p>YOU HAVE TOLD US OF THE YOUNG GIRL FOR WHOM THE RECOLLECTION OF A
PREVIOUS LIFE PROVED TRAUMATIC, BUT IF HYPNOSIS WERE CONDUCTED UNDER THE
RIGHT SUPERVISION, WITH THE RIGHT GUIDANCE, IT COULD PROVE THE KEY TO A
WHOLE NEW GENERATION OF PEOPLE.</p><p><br></p><p>WOULD YOU PLEASE COMMENT?</p><p><br></p><p>Hypnosis is a very powerful method, and one has to be always aware
that it can do immense good, but it can also do immense harm. The
question is, in whose hands is the power?</p><p><br></p><p>You are right that hypnosis can help children immensely in every
direction: in maturity, in individuality, in freedom, in meditation, in
education, in intelligence, in memory. It can help them, but it can also
harm them.</p><p><br></p><p>If the power is in the wrong hands the same hypnosis can be used to
enslave people, to destroy their individuality, to destroy even the idea
of freedom; to convince them that they are born slaves and they will
remain slaves and that to revolt is simply risking their lives.</p><p><br></p><p>So the whole question depends on whose hands hypnosis is in. Right
now I will not suggest it, because society is in the wrong hands and the
society is causing every wrong to be planted in human beings. But
hypnosis can be of tremendous help to them.</p><p><br></p><p>I would certainly suggest that children of sannyasins can be helped,
but before anybody starts helping children, he should go through the
whole process himself, so he is acquainted with the terrain, and knows
where there are pitfalls.</p><p><br></p><p>We cannot use it yet with the masses. One day, when the whole world
is a little more alert, the children can be benefited inconceivably, but
right now you have to confine yourself first to sannyasins, and secondly
to their children, and you have to be very aware of what you are doing,
because children are very delicate. Nothing wrong should reach their
minds.</p><p><br></p><p>And hypnosis takes things deep into the unconscious. It is a
tremendously powerful method, and can bring great joys to children – and
multidimensionally. In education: if a child is lagging behind, he can
be supported by hypnosis and the same child will be in the front. If in
a certain subject the child is finding difficulties, those difficulties
can be removed just by suggestions in hypnosis.</p><p>If you want to learn a new language, it is always more difficult as
you grow older – for children it is not difficult, they can be molded
very easily. Each child should be made capable of learning the
international language through hypnosis. The other language he will be
learning in the routine way.</p><p>He can become more independent, he can become more loving – all ugly
things like jealousy, anger, hatred can be removed completely.
Competition, ambition, he will never know. And all the energy that goes
into jealousy, anger, hatred, competition, ambition, can be focused
towards a certain talent. That talent also can be discovered in
hypnosis; otherwise it is very difficult – almost impossible – to find
out what talent a child has, what genius he has. We know only when a
person has expressed his genius. We do not know millions of others who
have died without expressing themselves, because they had no
opportunity, no situation supporting them, and every kind of hindrance.
And they themselves had no idea what was their destiny, what they were
meant to be.</p><p>Hypnosis can discover first what the child is meant to be, and then
redirect the energies from all wrong sources towards the creative
talent. So on the one hand, wrong expressions, ugly expressions
disappear, which create only misery and poison for the child and for
others, and on the other hand, all that energy becomes his creative
expression.</p><p>And one thing should be remembered as a fundamental rule: if a person
finds a way to express himself, in tune with his destiny, he will be
always joyous. He will be bubbling with happiness. He has found the
right path, but again I would like you to remember, it cannot be done
with the masses.</p><p>These methods should be kept confined to the world of sannyasins, so
we can show to the world, “You can see our children, and you can see
your children, and you can see the difference.”</p><p>Seventy percent of diseases are mind-oriented. Through hypnosis those
diseases can be prevented before they occur. Through hypnosis it can be
found out what kind of sickness is going to happen in the near future.
There are no symptoms on the body, the routine physical examination of
the person will not show any indication that he is going to be sick or
ill, he is perfectly healthy.</p><p>But through hypnosis we can find that within three weeks he is going
to fall sick, because before anything comes to the body, it comes from
the deep cosmic unconscious. It travels from there to the collective
unconscious, to the unconscious, and only then, when it comes to the
conscious mind, can it be checked and found in the body.</p><p>Sicknesses can be prevented even before the person has any idea that
he is going to be sick.</p><p><br></p><p>In Russia, one genius photographer, Kirlian, has even photographed
people<span class=s4></span>His whole life he has</p><p>been working in photography, with very sensitive plates, sensitive
lenses, to find something which is not available to ordinary eyes and
ordinary instruments. And he was puzzled that he can see in his
photographs at least six months ahead.</p><p>If he takes a picture of a rosebud with his special sensitive plates,
the picture is not of a rosebud, the picture is of a rose. Tomorrow it
is going to be a rose. No other camera can do that miracle.</p><p>First he himself was puzzled how the sensitive plate can take a
picture of something which has not happened yet – and when tomorrow the
bud opens up, it is exactly similar to the photograph, there is no
difference at all.</p><p>Then he discovered more and more that there is a certain aura
surrounding the bud – just an energy aura, and that energy aura has the
whole program of how the bud is going to open. The sensitive plate gets
the picture of the energy aura that we cannot see with our bare eyes.
Then he started working on diseases, and in Soviet medicine he has
created a revolution.</p><p><br></p><p>You need not first become sick, and then be cured. You can be cured
even before you had any knowledge of any sickness, because Kirlian
photography will show in what part the sickness is going to show,
because the energy aura will be sick, already sick. It is six months
ahead. It is connected with your cosmic unconscious.</p><p><br></p><p>Through hypnosis and deeper experiments with it, you can find
sicknesses that are going to happen and they can be treated. The
children can be more happy. It has been a topic of concern to the
psychoanalysts why all over the world, except in a few places, seventy
years has become the routine idea of the length of life, because there
are a few tribes in Kashmir, in India – now that part has been occupied
by Pakistan, a very small part – where people have always lived one
hundred and thirty years, one hundred and forty years, one hundred and
fifty, and even at the age of one hundred and fifty they were as
energetic as any young man. They never became old, they remained young
until they died.</p><p><br></p><p>In Soviet Russia, in the Caucasus, from where Joseph Stalin came and
George Gurdjieff came.… The Caucasus has produced really strong men.
There is a small part where people live even to one hundred and eighty
years. There are thousands of people who have passed one hundred and
fifty.</p><p><br></p><p>One of my friends was working there and he asked a farmer, who was
tilling the ground, “How old are you?”</p><p><br></p><p>He counted on his fingers, because he was uneducated. He said, “It
must be nearabout one hundred and eighty.”</p><p><br></p><p>My friend could not believe it – one hundred and eighty! – and he is
still young.</p><p><br></p><p>He enquired in the town and they said, “He is right. His father lived
for two hundred years and we hope that he will also live two hundred
years, because no sign of death can be seen.”</p><p><br></p><p>Psychologists have been concerned to find the reason why in a few
places people live long and in most of the world people live only the
routine seventy years.</p><p><br></p><p>George Bernard Shaw, when he became seventy years old, moved away
from London. His friends said, “What are you doing? In old age it is
better to be here with friends, society – and you are a man of society,
a man of culture.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I cannot live here. I am now seventy. This society believes
that people die at seventy and that belief is dangerous. I am going to
find some place where people don’t believe such a thing.”</p><p><br></p><p>And he found a small village nearby, and the way he went to find out
was to go into graveyards and look on the stones for how long people had
been living; and on a stone he found in one graveyard it said that the
man had lived one hundred and twenty years. And the graveyard stone was
saying, “He died an untimely death at the age of one hundred and twenty
years.”</p><p>He said, “This is the place to live, where people think that somebody
dying at one hundred and twenty is untimely.” And he lived there, and he
lived long. He managed to live a century. And in that graveyard that was
the case; on all the stones nobody had died at seventy.</p><p><br></p><p>It seems to be that it is just a psychological programming. For
centuries we have been programmed... seven decades and you are finished.
That has gone so deep that you die, not because your body is not capable
of living, but because your psychology insists, “Follow the routine.
Follow the crowd.” And in everything else you are following the crowd,
so naturally you follow the crowd psychology in this too.</p><p><br></p><p>Scientists say that man’s body is capable of living at least three
hundred years. Just as it goes on rejuvenating itself for seventy years,
in fact it can go on for three hundred years, but the program has to be
changed. Scientists think in a different way how to change the program,
and it will take very long for them. They think the program is in the
cells of the body.</p><p><br></p><p>So unless we split the human cell, just as we have been able to split
the atom, and reprogram it, which seems to be far away, because even the
scratch work has not started.…</p><p><br></p><p>But my understanding is that there is no need to go through
physiology, you can go through psychology. If your hypnosis goes deep
enough... the more you go into it, if it becomes an every day thing,
slowly, slowly you will touch the cosmic unconscious and there is the
real programming, you can change it.</p><p><br></p><p>Our children can live longer, our children can live healthier, our
children can live without old age. All this is possible, and we have to
make it, to show to the world, but it is dangerous in the sense that if
politicians get hold of hypnotic methods they are going to use it for
their own purposes.</p><p><br></p><p>Now in the Soviet Union every child has to be born in the hospital.
Nobody is allowed for his child to be born in his own house, with
friends, with warmth – no, that is illegal. There is a danger that if
the child is from the very beginning in the hands of the bureaucrats,
they can implant an electrode in the head of any child, or all children,
and that electrode in the head can be controlled from far away – remote
control.</p><p><br></p><p>It can be helpful, but not in these ugly politicians’ hands. They are
going to make dangerous use of that. No revolution would be possible,
because your mind would no more be in your own control. It has never
been, but at least you had the idea that your mind is free – it never
was. It was Christian, it was Hindu, it was Mohammedan – it was never
free.</p><p><br></p><p>But there was a possibility, because the old method of conditioning
the mind was a very long process; but putting an electrode in the mind
is a simple process, and the control is in the hands of the government,
or it can be in the hands of a computer.</p><p><br></p><p>It can enslave people, it can force people to go to fight – it can do
anything, and you will feel that you are doing it.</p><p><br></p><p>The same is the thing with hypnosis. Even without electrodes children
are in the hands of the government. In the schools they could enforce
one hour of hypnotic sessions for every child, and</p><p>they could manage to program it in any way they want: that there is
no soul, there is no evolution, that man is only matter.</p><p><br></p><p>Then all efforts of searching for truth would disappear.</p><p><br></p><p>So we have to use these methods with our own children, and we have to
be very cautious that these methods are not made available to
politicians. Once anything is in their hands they are going to exploit
it. And this is the greatest thing – man’s whole personality is just in
their fist.</p><p><br></p><p>They will never allow the children to have individuality, or any love
for freedom, or any desire to be creative. They would like them to be
servile. That’s why I am calling this a mystery school. We will work as
a school, and once we start different schools in different countries, I
have to make you aware about many things that have to come, that they
should not be made public. At least their basic secrets should not be
made public; they should remain in the hands of your school. Anybody who
wants to go through the transformation has to come to the school, so
that governments cannot start using them for their own vested
interests.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 3 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>IT IS SAID THAT IF ONE TRAVELS AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT, ONE DISAPPEARS,
AND WHEN ONE IS ENLIGHTENED, ONE ALSO DISAPPEARS.</p><p><br></p><p>IS THERE ANY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO?</p><p><br></p><p>There is – from two different sides. They come to a meeting point in
the middle. If somebody travels at the speed of light, he will become
light, because the speed of light is so tremendous, it will burn
anything. Scientists have been thinking to make some kind of vehicle
which can travel with the speed of light, but the question is of what
metal to make it, because at that speed everything will burn.</p><p><br></p><p>We don’t have anything yet, unless science manages to create
something synthetic. Up to now there is no hope, it is only theoretical.
Even at lesser speeds things burn.</p><p><br></p><p>You see every night stars falling; they are not stars – if a star
falls on the earth, the earth is finished – they are stones. Stones from
when the earth was liquid and was solidifying and was moving as fast as
it is moving now. Any liquid thing if it moves will throw off many
parts. Liquid parts will get off and be thrown away.</p><p><br></p><p>The moon is part of the earth – when it was very liquid a big chunk
fell off. These big oceans – Pacific, Atlantic – are just places from
where pieces of the earth have been thrown off. But when big things like
the moon were being thrown off, many small stones were also being thrown
off, and they have been roaming through space for millions of years.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever they come close to earth – that is, the earth’s gravitation
which extends two hundred miles from the surface of the earth into the
sky<span class=s4></span>If they come within a two-hundred-mile
radius, then the</p><p>earth pulls them and the pull is so much, and they run so fast
towards earth, that they burn up on the way. That’s what you see when
you say, “A star has fallen.” And at least thousands of stars fall every
night, all around the earth. Sometimes a stone is so big that even
though it burns, it reaches to the earth.</p><p><br></p><p>The stone in the Kaaba, which Mohammedans worship, is such a stone –
it is not of the earth, and that’s why it became special, because
nowhere on the earth can that kind of stone be found. It burnt but it
fell. Mostly they never reach the earth, and this is not the speed of
light.</p><p><br></p><p>The speed of light is tremendous – it is the ultimate speed. In one
second light travels one hundred and eighty-six thousand miles. Multiply
it by sixty, that will be how far it goes in one minute. Multiply it by
sixty again, that will be how far in one hour. Multiply it by
twenty-four, that will be how far in one day. And multiply it by three
hundred and sixty-five, that will be how far in one year, and that is
the smallest measurement of distance in space.</p><p><br></p><p>So distance is measured in years, light years – how many light years
a certain star is away. For example the sun is nearabout ten light
minutes away from the earth. Even ten minutes<span class=s4></span>So
if a</p><p>certain thing moves with that speed, it is bound to disappear.</p><p><br></p><p>And the question is that the enlightened person also disappears. The
enlightened person disappears through a totally different process, but
his disappearance and calling that disappearance enlightenment, as if
his being has become light, certainly means that after enlightenment he
has the speed of light. He is not trying to move at the speed of light,
his disappearance is from a different process of awakening, but when he
disappears that disappearance has been described by all the mystics in
terms of light.</p><p><br></p><p>I must have come across hundreds of mystics describing it as if
suddenly thousands of suns have risen within you. That is a common
expression in the mystic’s language, in all languages, in different
countries, in different races. So although the disappearance happens
from a different process, the ultimate peak is that the whole being
becomes light. And certainly light always travels with the same
speed.</p><p><br></p><p>So either you travel with the same speed and you will disappear, or
you disappear and you will be traveling with the speed of light.
Traveling with the speed of light is the work science has to do, and
disappearing through being aware is the work that religion has to
do.</p><p><br></p><p>And there is the meeting point. Coming from different routes, but
coming to the same peak, to the same experience.</p><p><br></p><p>There is certainly a deep relationship between the two experiences
but their processes are different. Question 4</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>THERE SEEMS TO BE MANY WAYS OF ENTERING THE BASEMENT OF THE
UNCONSCIOUS, AND EQUALLY AS MANY WAYS INTO THE SUPERCONSCIOUS. IS IT
POSSIBLE TO BECOME ENLIGHTENED FROM MY CHAIR IN THE LIVING ROOM?</p><p>Milarepa, it is possible to become enlightened from anywhere, and a
comfortable chair, particularly, is not a hindrance to it. Just don’t
try my chair!</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part21>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

IT LOOKS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO ADD A NEW SPICE TO SOMETHING WHICH ALREADY CONTAINS ALL THE SPICES WHICH CAN BE FOUND ON THIS EARTH.\nIt seems almost impossible, but one can never predict about the future.\nThe future remains open. What seems inconceivable today, may become conceivable tomorrow.\nWe can never come to a point where the future closes. That’s the whole meaning of existence being eternal.\nIt may be very difficult because I am not confined to any particular path, to any particular philosophical viewpoint. I am vast enough to contain contradictions, and whatever has happened on the earth as far as the evolution of consciousness is concerned, I have made it part of my own vision of life.\nSo if you look backwards, everything else will seem a little poorer, even the greatest giants will seem limited. But you are looking to the past, you are not looking to the future – which is absolutely unpredictable.\nThings will go on happening, new things will go on being added. And I am not a pond which is closed; I am more like a river, which goes on flowing, inviting every other river to join.\nWhatever I have been giving you will remain uncontaminated, but it will be enriched more and more by the future evolution of man, because it is an open phenomenon.\nI am not the last prophet, messiah or savior of a certain tradition. I am the beginning, not the end, of a totally new approach to life and its problems, inviting everything conceivable, unconceivable, to be my guest.\nSo you are right. It seems very difficult, but existence is so vast and the possibilities so infinite that you can never say that the full stop has come. It never comes, not even a semicolon comes. Life knows no full stop, no semicolons; it simply goes on and on, and it will continue to add spices of which we are not even aware. And it is good.\nIt means that I am giving you something living, which will go on growing – even beyond us it will have its own growth. I am not giving you something dead, as was the convention of the old.\nMohammed says, “I am the last messenger of God. Now there will be no other messenger. And the Koran is the last message. After the Koran there will be no other holy book.”\nHe is not aware that he cannot stop existence with his own death. Many prophets have come and gone.\nThey have added to the beauty of existence, but nobody should be so arrogant as to say, “I am the last.”\nThe same is the situation with Mahavira. He is the last tirthankara of the Jainas. Now there is not going to be any other tirthankara, nothing can be added to his teachings, nothing can be taken away from his teachings.\nBut these people were not aware that they are making their vision into a dead thing with their own hands.\nThat’s why Christians are so afraid in case science should discover anything which goes against the Bible, Mohammedans are so afraid in case anybody should say anything that goes beyond the Koran. But these are the enemies of progress, enemies of life.\nI am not. I am just a friend, a humble beginning, a living reality with every day new excitement, new ecstasies, new spaces; and capable to absorb them all, not afraid of any progress. If anything is wrong, I am always ready to drop it, always to be on the side of truth.\nThere are two kinds of people: those who want the truth to be always on their side – these are the egoists, arrogant. And there is another type of person who always wants to be on the side of truth, whatever the cost; if he has to lose everything, he is ready, but he cannot stop being on the side of truth. These are the humble ones, these are the true holy people of the earth – and there have been very few.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nI LIKE TO HEAR YOU SPEAK ON THE MEETING OF INNER MAN AND OUTER WOMAN.\nIS THE INNER MAN TO BE FOUND IN ONE OF THE REALMS OF CONSCIOUSNESS AND IF SO, IS THERE A WAY TO PROVOKE HIS PRESENCE SO THAT I MIGHT RECOGNIZE HIM IN SITUATIONS WHERE I HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN UNAWARE?\nThe inner man or the inner woman is not to be found unless you reach to the highest peak; unless you come to the cosmic superconscious you will not be able to recognize it; only at that peak the dualities meet and you can feel the orgasmic experience of the meeting. Slowly, slowly you can become aware of two opposite polarities moving together in harmony, in a dance, but you will not come across it at all on the way, only at the end of the journey.\nQuestion 3 BELOVED OSHO,\nLOOKING FOR MY CHIEF CHARACTERISTIC – JUST LOOKING FOR IT – IS PROVING A GREAT DEVICE. IT IS AS THOUGH I HAVE ALWAYS ACCEPTED THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN “UNDESIRABLES” IN MY CLOSET, WHICH AT DIFFERENT TIMES I GATHER SOME DEGREE OF ENTHUSIASM FOR GETTING RID OF OR WITNESSING MORE CONSCIENTIOUSLY.\nSETTING ABOUT TRYING TO PINPOINT THEM DURING THE LAST FORTY-EIGHT HOURS, I HAVE FOUND THAT THE ACTUAL PROCESS OF OPENING THE CLOSET AND FLASHING THE TORCH AROUND HAS, IN ITSELF, RENDERED THOSE SKELETONS IMPOTENT IN A WAY. IT IS CERTAINLY AS IF MERELY TALKING ABOUT THOSE SKELETONS AS PROBLEMS, RATHER THAN LOOKING AT THEM, GIVES SUBSTANCE TO SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY HAS NO LIFE OF ITS OWN.\nOSHO, AM I KIDDING MYSELF, OR IS IT REALLY THAT EASY?\nIt is that easy. Many of our problems are just there because we have never looked at them, never focused our eyes on them to figure out what it is.\nIt is like an ancient story. It was a fullmoon night and a thief had stolen much jewelry. And of course he was afraid. He was running, and suddenly he heard some steps following him.\nIt almost always happens – if you have ever tried running in the dark – you hear your own footsteps and you feel as if somebody is following you.\nAnd when he looked, he found somebody actually was following him; it was his own shadow. But he was not in a situation to figure out who it was. His problem was somehow to escape out of its clutches. He ran faster, but he heard the follower also running faster. And he went on looking back and he found that it was just behind him. The poor fellow was tired, utterly tired, but could not get\nrid of his shadow. Exhausted, he fell under a tree where the moonlight did not go and he looked all around and he wondered where the other fellow had gone – just now he was behind him, so close.\nGathering courage, looking all around, he could not see him anywhere; but then he came out of the shadow of the tree and again he was behind him. But this time he could not be deceived, he turned around and looked at the fellow. It was no one. It was his own shadow.\nMany of our problems – perhaps most of our problems – are because we have never looked at them face to face, never encountered them; and not looking at them is giving them energy, being afraid of them is giving them energy, always trying to avoid them is giving them energy – because you are accepting them. Your very acceptance is their existence. Other than your acceptance, they don’t exist.\nSo if you open your closets, and take your light, and look at the skeletons, you will find they are dead.\nSkeletons cannot do anything, but almost everybody is afraid of skeletons. It is a strange situation. You are not afraid of living people who can do damage to you, who can even kill you – and they are all hiding a skeleton underneath just skin deep, and they are living people. But if you suddenly come across in a room a poor skeleton who has no life, you become so afraid. What can the skeleton do to you?\nIn my university I had a friend who was the son of a doctor, and the doctor was the head of the university hospital and also it was part of the medical college.\nAnd they had many skeletons for studying purposes.\nAnd one day I was saying to his son, “Your father at least must be the one man who is not afraid of skeletons.”\nHe said, “Certainly he’s not afraid. The whole day he is telling the students about the skeletons, their parts.”\nAnd he had a good collection. He used to live in the compound of the hospital.\nSo I said, “Then we have to check whether it is true or not.” I asked the son, “Somehow you have to get the key of the room where the skeletons are and in the night we will bring one skeleton out. Just knock on the door, the father comes to open it and we will hide and the skeleton will be standing there and let us see what happens.”\nThe son said, ” You will get me into trouble.”\nI said, “You don’t be worried. You simply escape as far as you can. And you can trust me, I will never mention your name if anything happens.”\nAnd you will not believe, the man who has been dealing with skeletons for years, when I knocked on his door, he said, “Who is there?”\nI said, “Can’t you recognize me?” He opened the door.\nI slipped to the side behind a tree; there was a very big bodhi tree there. And he saw the skeleton. And you should have seen the scene, just as if he lost all his nerve. He fell on the earth. And on top fell the skeleton.\nHis wife came, “What is happening?” Seeing the skeleton on her husband, she screamed and became unconscious.\nAnd the neighbors woke up because of her scream, and everybody was coming there – but they were all standing far away, seeing the situation. The wife was lying flat, the husband was lying there, and the skeleton was on top of him. And I was hiding behind the tree. And I thought, “Now what to do?” We had not conceived of such a situation. I had just thought that he will freak out. But the situation had become so complex. And his son was looking from far away.\nI called to him, “This is not the time to be afraid.” Somehow he picked up the skeleton, left those two there – both were unconscious – and put the skeleton back in its place. And it took great effort to put it back because it had fallen, so one hand was going this way, one leg was going this way, and we were both trying to fix it.\nSomehow we fixed it, by looking at the other skeletons, “You should behave exactly like the other skeletons.”\nThen we came back to take care of the doctor and his wife, sprinkling water on their faces, and telling them, “There is nobody. You unnecessarily got worried.”\nThe doctor said, “I cannot believe that there is nobody. He was standing in front of me, and he is no one. He’s skeleton number seventeen, I know him well; but how he dared to come here? And the door is locked, and I always check the lock because skeletons are skeletons, you can’t trust them.”\nWe said, “We have not seen anybody. We had just gone for a walk and we have just come in and we saw you lying down here as if somebody is on top of you and there is nobody. And your wife is on the floor flat. Do something to bring her to consciousness.”\nSo he did whatever he could. Somehow she came to consciousness. And she asked, “Where is he – the skeleton?”\nAnd the doctor said, “I cannot believe it, because number seventeen is an old skeleton and has never misbehaved, and suddenly it came and knocked on the door and even said, ‘Can’t you recognize me?’” He said, “Now it will be very difficult for me to continue going into that room. I am going to change my department, no more skeletons.”\nI said, “You have unnecessarily hallucinated after a whole day working with the skeletons . You may have just seen an illusion – because we were coming, we did not see anybody coming or going, and the key is in your pocket.”\nSo he saw. He said, “The key is in my pocket.”\nI said, “If you want, we can go and see where number seventeen is.”\nHe said, “No, I won’t allow you to go there. If he has gone out without even opening the door, he can do some harm to you. You need not bother. Tomorrow I am going to change my department.”\nHe changed his department. The vice-chancellor tried hard, saying, “Skeletons don’t come out, and you have had such a long experience with skeletons.”\nHe said, “Whatever, but what happened last night, if it happens again I will die. And you have to think about my wife also. She is very delicate and she has had one heart attack already. And if these skeletons start coming in the middle of the night knocking on the door...!”\nI have always been puzzled why people are so afraid of skeletons, because they are very poor people – with no life, they cannot do anything. But there seems to be some unconscious current, “We are also skeletons.” Seeing a skeleton, you are seeing yourself without the skin.\nAnd this will be your situation one day. Perhaps the skeleton reminds you of death, it reminds you of your reality which the skin goes on hiding. Otherwise skeletons are very innocent, they have never done any harm to anybody.\nI used to sell skeletons from a Mohammedan graveyard because the medical college needed them and they gave a good price for a skeleton. And nobody was ready to bring a skeleton. I had made friends with the guard of the graveyard and arranged that we would split half and half, “Just you dig out some old fellow and I will take him in my car and deliver him to the medical college.”\nOnce when I was taking a skeleton in my car, a policeman stopped the car – because I was going too fast. He wanted to see my driver’s license. I said, “The fellow in the back seat has it.”\nSo he looked in the back seat.\nAnd he said, “Yes, I have seen it. Everything is okay. Go fast, as fast as you can. I can understand now why you are going so fast, but however fast you go he’s sitting just behind you. You cannot escape. But please go.”\nAnd many times when I bring those skeletons to the medical college, somebody will see – some professor or some servant. And they will simply just get frozen. Nobody ever asked for a lift in my car, because they knew that a skeleton sits in the back seat. Nobody ever asked. I used to ask professors, “Would you like to come?”\n“Not in your car.”\nSuch a fear, but it must have some roots.\nAnd I can see that the first thing is that it reminds you of yourself. This is going to be the situation. We are all simply well-covered skeletons.\nAnd this will be the situation when death comes. So it reminds you of death. So nobody opens the cupboards in their unconscious where they have many skeletons, of many kinds.\nYou yourself have put them there and now you are afraid of them. But the reality is that they are dead; just open the doors, bring light, clean your closets, clean your mind of all the dead luggage that you are filled with – it is making your life really miserable, a hell.\nAnd nobody except you is responsible. In the first place, you hide things which you should not. It is good to give them expression and release them. So first you hide them, and just remain a hypocrite – that you are never angry, that you are never hateful, that you are never this, never that; but all that goes on collecting inside. But those are all dead things. They don’t have any energy of their own, unless you give them energy. You have the source of energy. Whatever happens in your life needs your energy. If you cut the source of energy and... in other words that’s what I call identification; if you don’t identify with anything, it immediately becomes dead, it has no energy of its own.\nAnd non-identification is the other side of watchfulness.\nLove the beauty of watchfulness and its immense capacity to transform you. Simply watch whatever it is, and you will suddenly see that there is nothing but a dead skeleton, it cannot do anything to you. But you can give energy to it, you can project energy onto it. Then a skeleton which cannot do anything can even kill you, can give you a heart attack; just start escaping from it and you have given it reality, you have given it life.\nGive life to things which are beautiful. Don’t give life to ugly things. You don’t have much time, much energy to waste. With such a small life, with such a small energy source, it is simply stupid to waste it in sadness, in anger, in hatred, in jealousy.\nUse it in love, use it in some creative act, use it in friendship, use it in meditation; do something with it which takes you higher. And the higher you go, the more energy sources become available to you.\nAt the highest point of consciousness, you are almost a god. But that moment we don’t allow to happen to us. We go on falling downwards into the darker and darker and darker spaces where we ourselves become almost living dead.\nIt is in your hands. Question 4 BELOVED OSHO,\nA WHILE AGO I REALIZED THAT IT IS NOT SITUATIONS BUT RATHER PEOPLE THAT I CAN REACT TO – BECAUSE IF SOMEONE I FEEL GOOD ABOUT DOES SOMETHING, IT DOESN’T BOTHER ME, BUT IF SOMEONE I DON’T LIKE DOES THE SAME THING, I MAY THINK, “WHAT AN AWFUL THING TO DO.”\nINTELLECTUALLY I HAVE COME TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE REASON I DON’T LIKE CERTAIN PEOPLE IS SIMPLY THAT THEY REFLECT CERTAIN CHARACTERISTICS IN MYSELF THAT I WOULD RATHER NOT KNOW ABOUT.\nI WAS HOPING THAT GRADUALLY, DEEP INSIDE, I WOULD COME TO ACCEPT THIS RATHER UNPALATABLE FACT, AND THAT MY JUDGMENTS WOULD MIRACULOUSLY DISAPPEAR WITHOUT MY HAVING TO FACE ANYTHING UNPLEASANT IN MYSELF. UNFORTUNATELY, SO FAR THIS HASN’T HAPPENED. I STILL REACT STRONGLY TO SOME PEOPLE, AND FIND IT DIFFICULT SOMETIMES EVEN TO REMEMBER TO TURN MY ENERGY INTO WATCHING MYSELF RATHER THAN JUDGING.\nI HAVE BEEN COMFORTING MYSELF BY SAYING, “NOTHING TO DO, JUST KEEP WATCHING,” BUT AS MY WATCHING IS SO WISHY-WASHY AND THIS IS TAKING SO LONG, I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD SUGGEST SOME TRICK TO HELP ME – PREFERABLY A SHORTCUT THROUGH THE WHOLE PROCESS.\nThere is no trick and there is no shortcut because watchfulness is the shortest way to enlightenment. And the question of tricks does not arise at all.\nNo trick can help you.\nTricks are good in playing cards and cheating people, but you cannot cheat existence, you cannot deceive life.\nIf you want to go a longer way, that can be found; because you can be shown some unnecessary, non-essential things and the path becomes longer.\nReligions have done that. They have made the path very long, so that it cannot be achieved in one life, many lives are needed. It was a strategy of the priests to deceive people because if it is said that it can be achieved right now, then the question is why are you not achieving it, perhaps you don’t want it, perhaps you want to wait a little, perhaps you want to finish some other jobs first, perhaps you think that enlightenment should be the last thing in life. And the trivia, the mundane things of life, keep you engaged.\nBut there may be a few people who may try and still will not get it. Then the priest will be in trouble because he himself is as far away as you are. To be a priest is just a profession for him, he is not a seeker. And you may start asking him, “Why is it not happening?” And he cannot really answer you relevantly because he does not know himself what it is, what can prevent it, what can help it.\nSo the easiest way for him is to say, “It is such a long way. It will happen but in several lives. So don’t be in a hurry, it is not something that you can manage now. Go on working, go on praying; when the time is ripe in some life it will happen.” This was just a shelter for the priest.\nWatchfulness is the shortest way. It does not need lives to attain it. It needs not length of time but intensity of longing, the way you feel thirst; when you feel thirsty for truth – as if it is a question of life and death – you put your whole energy to this moment and the door is bound to open.\nAnd remember never to think of tricks because you cannot get anywhere through tricks as far as reality is concerned.\nThe simple truth is that watchfulness is the shortest possible way. It cannot be made shorter.\nWhat is expected of you in watchfulness... just try to see, nothing is expected. You already watch things, you know what watchfulness is. You watch a football match, you watch a movie, you watch the television. You know what watchfulness is, there is no need to tell you; just the same watchfulness has to be applied to the screen of the mind. Close your eyes and let your mind function as a screen of a movie or a television, and whatever passes on the mind you simply remain watchful, doing nothing, not even judging.\nAnd this is the only miracle I know of, that as your watchfulness becomes more and more stable, the screen becomes empty. Soon the watcher is there but there is nothing to be watched, the screen is completely empty.\nAnd when the watcher is left alone, it starts watching itself – because that is its nature, to watch.\nAnd to watch oneself is the greatest happening in anyone’s life. Everything else happens through it – blissfulness, silence, peace, ecstasy, and finally going beyond even all these experiences and just remaining in a pure isness.\nThose who have attained that pure isness have fulfilled the mission of human life. Question 5\nBELOVED OSHO,\nA FEW DAYS AGO I WATCHED YOU BRUSHING ASIDE A FLY, AND THERE WAS ALL THE AWARENESS, GRACE, LOVE AND COMPASSION IN IT WHICH WERE MISSING IN BUDDHA’S FIRST MECHANICAL MOVEMENT IN THE STORY YOU TOLD A FEW DAYS LATER. YOU EVEN WAITED FOR THE RIGHT MOMENT TO DISGUISE THE MOVEMENT OF YOUR HAND IN A GESTURE ILLUSTRATING YOUR WORDS.\nI WAS REALLY THRILLED. THANK YOU, OSHO.\nI can understand your thankfulness because even to watch, even to see a gesture which is full of awareness and grace is a great experience, a great learning.\nThe master not only goes on saying beautiful things to you, he also goes on showing beautiful spaces to you. So you have to be alert not only in hearing him but also in seeing him, also in feeling him – not only his words, but his gestures; not only his gestures, but his presence.

HAVE BEEN ADDING THEIR OWN FLAVOR TO BUDDHA’S TEACHING, I STARTED
WONDERING WHETHER THERE WILL EVER BE ANYBODY ADDING A NEW FLAVOR TO YOUR
POT. IT LOOKS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO ADD A NEW SPICE TO SOMETHING WHICH
ALREADY CONTAINS ALL THE SPICES WHICH CAN BE FOUND ON THIS EARTH.</p><p><br></p><p>It seems almost impossible, but one can never predict about the
future.</p><p><br></p><p>The future remains open. What seems inconceivable today, may become
conceivable tomorrow.</p><p><br></p><p>We can never come to a point where the future closes. That’s the
whole meaning of existence being eternal.</p><p><br></p><p>It may be very difficult because I am not confined to any particular
path, to any particular philosophical viewpoint. I am vast enough to
contain contradictions, and whatever has happened on the earth as far as
the evolution of consciousness is concerned, I have made it part of my
own vision of life.</p><p><br></p><p>So if you look backwards, everything else will seem a little poorer,
even the greatest giants will seem limited. But you are looking to the
past, you are not looking to the future – which is absolutely
unpredictable.</p><p>Things will go on happening, new things will go on being added. And I
am not a pond which is closed; I am more like a river, which goes on
flowing, inviting every other river to join.</p><p><br></p><p>Whatever I have been giving you will remain uncontaminated, but it
will be enriched more and more by the future evolution of man, because
it is an open phenomenon.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not the last prophet, messiah or savior of a certain tradition.
I am the beginning, not the end, of a totally new approach to life and
its problems, inviting everything conceivable, unconceivable, to be my
guest.</p><p><br></p><p>So you are right. It seems very difficult, but existence is so vast
and the possibilities so infinite that you can never say that the full
stop has come. It never comes, not even a semicolon comes. Life knows no
full stop, no semicolons; it simply goes on and on, and it will continue
to add spices of which we are not even aware. And it is good.</p><p><br></p><p>It means that I am giving you something living, which will go on
growing – even beyond us it will have its own growth. I am not giving
you something dead, as was the convention of the old.</p><p><br></p><p>Mohammed says, “I am the last messenger of God. Now there will be no
other messenger. And the Koran is the last message. After the Koran
there will be no other holy book.”</p><p><br></p><p>He is not aware that he cannot stop existence with his own death.
Many prophets have come and gone.</p><p><br></p><p>They have added to the beauty of existence, but nobody should be so
arrogant as to say, “I am the last.”</p><p><br></p><p>The same is the situation with Mahavira. He is the last tirthankara
of the Jainas. Now there is not going to be any other tirthankara,
nothing can be added to his teachings, nothing can be taken away from
his teachings.</p><p><br></p><p>But these people were not aware that they are making their vision
into a dead thing with their own hands.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why Christians are so afraid in case science should discover
anything which goes against the Bible, Mohammedans are so afraid in case
anybody should say anything that goes beyond the Koran. But these are
the enemies of progress, enemies of life.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not. I am just a friend, a humble beginning, a living reality
with every day new excitement, new ecstasies, new spaces; and capable to
absorb them all, not afraid of any progress. If anything is wrong, I am
always ready to drop it, always to be on the side of truth.</p><p><br></p><p>There are two kinds of people: those who want the truth to be always
on their side – these are the egoists, arrogant. And there is another
type of person who always wants to be on the side of truth, whatever the
cost; if he has to lose everything, he is ready, but he cannot stop
being on the side of truth. These are the humble ones, these are the
true holy people of the earth – and there have been very few.</p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>I LIKE TO HEAR YOU SPEAK ON THE MEETING OF INNER MAN AND OUTER
WOMAN.</p><p><br></p><p>IS THE INNER MAN TO BE FOUND IN ONE OF THE REALMS OF CONSCIOUSNESS
AND IF SO, IS THERE A WAY TO PROVOKE HIS PRESENCE SO THAT I MIGHT
RECOGNIZE HIM IN SITUATIONS WHERE I HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN UNAWARE?</p><p><br></p><p>The inner man or the inner woman is not to be found unless you reach
to the highest peak; unless you come to the cosmic superconscious you
will not be able to recognize it; only at that peak the dualities meet
and you can feel the orgasmic experience of the meeting. Slowly, slowly
you can become aware of two opposite polarities moving together in
harmony, in a dance, but you will not come across it at all on the way,
only at the end of the journey.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 3 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>LOOKING FOR MY CHIEF CHARACTERISTIC – JUST LOOKING FOR IT – IS
PROVING A GREAT DEVICE. IT IS AS THOUGH I HAVE ALWAYS ACCEPTED THAT
THERE ARE CERTAIN “UNDESIRABLES” IN MY CLOSET, WHICH AT DIFFERENT TIMES
I GATHER SOME DEGREE OF ENTHUSIASM FOR GETTING RID OF OR WITNESSING MORE
CONSCIENTIOUSLY.</p><p><br></p><p>SETTING ABOUT TRYING TO PINPOINT THEM DURING THE LAST FORTY-EIGHT
HOURS, I HAVE FOUND THAT THE ACTUAL PROCESS OF OPENING THE CLOSET AND
FLASHING THE TORCH AROUND HAS, IN ITSELF, RENDERED THOSE SKELETONS
IMPOTENT IN A WAY. IT IS CERTAINLY AS IF MERELY TALKING ABOUT THOSE
SKELETONS AS PROBLEMS, RATHER THAN LOOKING AT THEM, GIVES SUBSTANCE TO
SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY HAS NO LIFE OF ITS OWN.</p><p><br></p><p>OSHO, AM I KIDDING MYSELF, OR IS IT REALLY THAT EASY?</p><p><br></p><p>It is that easy. Many of our problems are just there because we have
never looked at them, never focused our eyes on them to figure out what
it is.</p><p><br></p><p>It is like an ancient story. It was a fullmoon night and a thief had
stolen much jewelry. And of course he was afraid. He was running, and
suddenly he heard some steps following him.</p><p><br></p><p>It almost always happens – if you have ever tried running in the dark
– you hear your own footsteps and you feel as if somebody is following
you.</p><p><br></p><p>And when he looked, he found somebody actually was following him; it
was his own shadow. But he was not in a situation to figure out who it
was. His problem was somehow to escape out of its clutches. He ran
faster, but he heard the follower also running faster. And he went on
looking back and he found that it was just behind him. The poor fellow
was tired, utterly tired, but could not get</p><p>rid of his shadow. Exhausted, he fell under a tree where the
moonlight did not go and he looked all around and he wondered where the
other fellow had gone – just now he was behind him, so close.</p><p><br></p><p>Gathering courage, looking all around, he could not see him anywhere;
but then he came out of the shadow of the tree and again he was behind
him. But this time he could not be deceived, he turned around and looked
at the fellow. It was no one. It was his own shadow.</p><p><br></p><p>Many of our problems – perhaps most of our problems – are because we
have never looked at them face to face, never encountered them; and not
looking at them is giving them energy, being afraid of them is giving
them energy, always trying to avoid them is giving them energy – because
you are accepting them. Your very acceptance is their existence. Other
than your acceptance, they don’t exist.</p><p><br></p><p>So if you open your closets, and take your light, and look at the
skeletons, you will find they are dead.</p><p><br></p><p>Skeletons cannot do anything, but almost everybody is afraid of
skeletons. It is a strange situation. You are not afraid of living
people who can do damage to you, who can even kill you – and they are
all hiding a skeleton underneath just skin deep, and they are living
people. But if you suddenly come across in a room a poor skeleton who
has no life, you become so afraid. What can the skeleton do to you?</p><p><br></p><p>In my university I had a friend who was the son of a doctor, and the
doctor was the head of the university hospital and also it was part of
the medical college.</p><p><br></p><p>And they had many skeletons for studying purposes.</p><p><br></p><p>And one day I was saying to his son, “Your father at least must be
the one man who is not afraid of skeletons.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Certainly he’s not afraid. The whole day he is telling the
students about the skeletons, their parts.”</p><p><br></p><p>And he had a good collection. He used to live in the compound of the
hospital.</p><p><br></p><p>So I said, “Then we have to check whether it is true or not.” I asked
the son, “Somehow you have to get the key of the room where the
skeletons are and in the night we will bring one skeleton out. Just
knock on the door, the father comes to open it and we will hide and the
skeleton will be standing there and let us see what happens.”</p><p><br></p><p>The son said, ” You will get me into trouble.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “You don’t be worried. You simply escape as far as you can.
And you can trust me, I will never mention your name if anything
happens.”</p><p><br></p><p>And you will not believe, the man who has been dealing with skeletons
for years, when I knocked on his door, he said, “Who is there?”</p><p>I said, “Can’t you recognize me?” He opened the door.</p><p>I slipped to the side behind a tree; there was a very big bodhi tree
there. And he saw the skeleton. And you should have seen the scene, just
as if he lost all his nerve. He fell on the earth. And on top fell the
skeleton.</p><p><br></p><p>His wife came, “What is happening?” Seeing the skeleton on her
husband, she screamed and became unconscious.</p><p><br></p><p>And the neighbors woke up because of her scream, and everybody was
coming there – but they were all standing far away, seeing the
situation. The wife was lying flat, the husband was lying there, and the
skeleton was on top of him. And I was hiding behind the tree. And I
thought, “Now what to do?” We had not conceived of such a situation. I
had just thought that he will freak out. But the situation had become so
complex. And his son was looking from far away.</p><p><br></p><p>I called to him, “This is not the time to be afraid.” Somehow he
picked up the skeleton, left those two there – both were unconscious –
and put the skeleton back in its place. And it took great effort to put
it back because it had fallen, so one hand was going this way, one leg
was going this way, and we were both trying to fix it.</p><p><br></p><p>Somehow we fixed it, by looking at the other skeletons, “You should
behave exactly like the other skeletons.”</p><p><br></p><p>Then we came back to take care of the doctor and his wife, sprinkling
water on their faces, and telling them, “There is nobody. You
unnecessarily got worried.”</p><p><br></p><p>The doctor said, “I cannot believe that there is nobody. He was
standing in front of me, and he is no one. He’s skeleton number
seventeen, I know him well; but how he dared to come here? And the door
is locked, and I always check the lock because skeletons are skeletons,
you can’t trust them.”</p><p><br></p><p>We said, “We have not seen anybody. We had just gone for a walk and
we have just come in and we saw you lying down here as if somebody is on
top of you and there is nobody. And your wife is on the floor flat. Do
something to bring her to consciousness.”</p><p><br></p><p>So he did whatever he could. Somehow she came to consciousness. And
she asked, “Where is he – the skeleton?”</p><p><br></p><p>And the doctor said, “I cannot believe it, because number seventeen
is an old skeleton and has never misbehaved, and suddenly it came and
knocked on the door and even said, ‘Can’t you recognize me?’” He said,
“Now it will be very difficult for me to continue going into that room.
I am going to change my department, no more skeletons.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “You have unnecessarily hallucinated after a whole day
working with the skeletons . You may have just seen an illusion –
because we were coming, we did not see anybody coming or going, and the
key is in your pocket.”</p><p>So he saw. He said, “The key is in my pocket.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “If you want, we can go and see where number seventeen
is.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “No, I won’t allow you to go there. If he has gone out
without even opening the door, he can do some harm to you. You need not
bother. Tomorrow I am going to change my department.”</p><p><br></p><p>He changed his department. The vice-chancellor tried hard, saying,
“Skeletons don’t come out, and you have had such a long experience with
skeletons.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Whatever, but what happened last night, if it happens again
I will die. And you have to think about my wife also. She is very
delicate and she has had one heart attack already. And if these
skeletons start coming in the middle of the night knocking on the
door...!”</p><p><br></p><p>I have always been puzzled why people are so afraid of skeletons,
because they are very poor people – with no life, they cannot do
anything. But there seems to be some unconscious current, “We are also
skeletons.” Seeing a skeleton, you are seeing yourself without the
skin.</p><p><br></p><p>And this will be your situation one day. Perhaps the skeleton reminds
you of death, it reminds you of your reality which the skin goes on
hiding. Otherwise skeletons are very innocent, they have never done any
harm to anybody.</p><p><br></p><p>I used to sell skeletons from a Mohammedan graveyard because the
medical college needed them and they gave a good price for a skeleton.
And nobody was ready to bring a skeleton. I had made friends with the
guard of the graveyard and arranged that we would split half and half,
“Just you dig out some old fellow and I will take him in my car and
deliver him to the medical college.”</p><p><br></p><p>Once when I was taking a skeleton in my car, a policeman stopped the
car – because I was going too fast. He wanted to see my driver’s
license. I said, “The fellow in the back seat has it.”</p><p><br></p><p>So he looked in the back seat.</p><p><br></p><p>And he said, “Yes, I have seen it. Everything is okay. Go fast, as
fast as you can. I can understand now why you are going so fast, but
however fast you go he’s sitting just behind you. You cannot escape. But
please go.”</p><p><br></p><p>And many times when I bring those skeletons to the medical college,
somebody will see – some professor or some servant. And they will simply
just get frozen. Nobody ever asked for a lift in my car, because they
knew that a skeleton sits in the back seat. Nobody ever asked. I used to
ask professors, “Would you like to come?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Not in your car.”</p><p><br></p><p>Such a fear, but it must have some roots.</p><p><br></p><p>And I can see that the first thing is that it reminds you of
yourself. This is going to be the situation. We are all simply
well-covered skeletons.</p><p>And this will be the situation when death comes. So it reminds you of
death. So nobody opens the cupboards in their unconscious where they
have many skeletons, of many kinds.</p><p><br></p><p>You yourself have put them there and now you are afraid of them. But
the reality is that they are dead; just open the doors, bring light,
clean your closets, clean your mind of all the dead luggage that you are
filled with – it is making your life really miserable, a hell.</p><p><br></p><p>And nobody except you is responsible. In the first place, you hide
things which you should not. It is good to give them expression and
release them. So first you hide them, and just remain a hypocrite – that
you are never angry, that you are never hateful, that you are never
this, never that; but all that goes on collecting inside. But those are
all dead things. They don’t have any energy of their own, unless you
give them energy. You have the source of energy. Whatever happens in
your life needs your energy. If you cut the source of energy and... in
other words that’s what I call identification; if you don’t identify
with anything, it immediately becomes dead, it has no energy of its
own.</p><p><br></p><p>And non-identification is the other side of watchfulness.</p><p><br></p><p>Love the beauty of watchfulness and its immense capacity to transform
you. Simply watch whatever it is, and you will suddenly see that there
is nothing but a dead skeleton, it cannot do anything to you. But you
can give energy to it, you can project energy onto it. Then a skeleton
which cannot do anything can even kill you, can give you a heart attack;
just start escaping from it and you have given it reality, you have
given it life.</p><p><br></p><p>Give life to things which are beautiful. Don’t give life to ugly
things. You don’t have much time, much energy to waste. With such a
small life, with such a small energy source, it is simply stupid to
waste it in sadness, in anger, in hatred, in jealousy.</p><p><br></p><p>Use it in love, use it in some creative act, use it in friendship,
use it in meditation; do something with it which takes you higher. And
the higher you go, the more energy sources become available to you.</p><p><br></p><p>At the highest point of consciousness, you are almost a god. But that
moment we don’t allow to happen to us. We go on falling downwards into
the darker and darker and darker spaces where we ourselves become almost
living dead.</p><p><br></p><p>It is in your hands. Question 4 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>A WHILE AGO I REALIZED THAT IT IS NOT SITUATIONS BUT RATHER PEOPLE
THAT I CAN REACT TO – BECAUSE IF SOMEONE I FEEL GOOD ABOUT DOES
SOMETHING, IT DOESN’T BOTHER ME, BUT IF SOMEONE I DON’T LIKE DOES THE
SAME THING, I MAY THINK, “WHAT AN AWFUL THING TO DO.”</p><p><br></p><p>INTELLECTUALLY I HAVE COME TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE REASON I DON’T LIKE
CERTAIN PEOPLE IS SIMPLY THAT THEY REFLECT CERTAIN CHARACTERISTICS IN
MYSELF THAT I WOULD RATHER NOT KNOW ABOUT.</p><p>I WAS HOPING THAT GRADUALLY, DEEP INSIDE, I WOULD COME TO ACCEPT THIS
RATHER UNPALATABLE FACT, AND THAT MY JUDGMENTS WOULD MIRACULOUSLY
DISAPPEAR WITHOUT MY HAVING TO FACE ANYTHING UNPLEASANT IN MYSELF.
UNFORTUNATELY, SO FAR THIS HASN’T HAPPENED. I STILL REACT STRONGLY TO
SOME PEOPLE, AND FIND IT DIFFICULT SOMETIMES EVEN TO REMEMBER TO TURN MY
ENERGY INTO WATCHING MYSELF RATHER THAN JUDGING.</p><p><br></p><p>I HAVE BEEN COMFORTING MYSELF BY SAYING, “NOTHING TO DO, JUST KEEP
WATCHING,” BUT AS MY WATCHING IS SO WISHY-WASHY AND THIS IS TAKING SO
LONG, I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD SUGGEST SOME TRICK TO HELP ME –
PREFERABLY A SHORTCUT THROUGH THE WHOLE PROCESS.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no trick and there is no shortcut because watchfulness is
the shortest way to enlightenment. And the question of tricks does not
arise at all.</p><p><br></p><p>No trick can help you.</p><p><br></p><p>Tricks are good in playing cards and cheating people, but you cannot
cheat existence, you cannot deceive life.</p><p><br></p><p>If you want to go a longer way, that can be found; because you can be
shown some unnecessary, non-essential things and the path becomes
longer.</p><p><br></p><p>Religions have done that. They have made the path very long, so that
it cannot be achieved in one life, many lives are needed. It was a
strategy of the priests to deceive people because if it is said that it
can be achieved right now, then the question is why are you not
achieving it, perhaps you don’t want it, perhaps you want to wait a
little, perhaps you want to finish some other jobs first, perhaps you
think that enlightenment should be the last thing in life. And the
trivia, the mundane things of life, keep you engaged.</p><p><br></p><p>But there may be a few people who may try and still will not get it.
Then the priest will be in trouble because he himself is as far away as
you are. To be a priest is just a profession for him, he is not a
seeker. And you may start asking him, “Why is it not happening?” And he
cannot really answer you relevantly because he does not know himself
what it is, what can prevent it, what can help it.</p><p><br></p><p>So the easiest way for him is to say, “It is such a long way. It will
happen but in several lives. So don’t be in a hurry, it is not something
that you can manage now. Go on working, go on praying; when the time is
ripe in some life it will happen.” This was just a shelter for the
priest.</p><p><br></p><p>Watchfulness is the shortest way. It does not need lives to attain
it. It needs not length of time but intensity of longing, the way you
feel thirst; when you feel thirsty for truth – as if it is a question of
life and death – you put your whole energy to this moment and the door
is bound to open.</p><p><br></p><p>And remember never to think of tricks because you cannot get anywhere
through tricks as far as reality is concerned.</p><p><br></p><p>The simple truth is that watchfulness is the shortest possible way.
It cannot be made shorter.</p><p>What is expected of you in watchfulness... just try to see, nothing
is expected. You already watch things, you know what watchfulness is.
You watch a football match, you watch a movie, you watch the television.
You know what watchfulness is, there is no need to tell you; just the
same watchfulness has to be applied to the screen of the mind. Close
your eyes and let your mind function as a screen of a movie or a
television, and whatever passes on the mind you simply remain watchful,
doing nothing, not even judging.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is the only miracle I know of, that as your watchfulness
becomes more and more stable, the screen becomes empty. Soon the watcher
is there but there is nothing to be watched, the screen is completely
empty.</p><p><br></p><p>And when the watcher is left alone, it starts watching itself –
because that is its nature, to watch.</p><p><br></p><p>And to watch oneself is the greatest happening in anyone’s life.
Everything else happens through it – blissfulness, silence, peace,
ecstasy, and finally going beyond even all these experiences and just
remaining in a pure isness.</p><p><br></p><p>Those who have attained that pure isness have fulfilled the mission
of human life. Question 5</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>A FEW DAYS AGO I WATCHED YOU BRUSHING ASIDE A FLY, AND THERE WAS ALL
THE AWARENESS, GRACE, LOVE AND COMPASSION IN IT WHICH WERE MISSING IN
BUDDHA’S FIRST MECHANICAL MOVEMENT IN THE STORY YOU TOLD A FEW DAYS
LATER. YOU EVEN WAITED FOR THE RIGHT MOMENT TO DISGUISE THE MOVEMENT OF
YOUR HAND IN A GESTURE ILLUSTRATING YOUR WORDS.</p><p><br></p><p>I WAS REALLY THRILLED. THANK YOU, OSHO.</p><p><br></p><p>I can understand your thankfulness because even to watch, even to see
a gesture which is full of awareness and grace is a great experience, a
great learning.</p><p><br></p><p>The master not only goes on saying beautiful things to you, he also
goes on showing beautiful spaces to you. So you have to be alert not
only in hearing him but also in seeing him, also in feeling him – not
only his words, but his gestures; not only his gestures, but his
presence. All are part of the teaching.</p><p><br></p><p>Words are the least important. Question 6</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>AMONG THE CONCLUDING SENTENCES OF THE BOOK OF MIRDAD ARE THE

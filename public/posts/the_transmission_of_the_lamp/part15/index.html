I SEEM TO HAVE RUN OUT OF AMBITION TO ACHIEVE ANYTHING FURTHER. EVEN ENLIGHTENMENT APPEARS TO BE A REMOTE AND IMPOSSIBLE GOAL, OUTSIDE THE REALM OF MY UNDERSTANDING.\nI LOVE TO SEE YOU AND TO BE WITH YOU AND I LOVE TO SAIL. APART FROM THESE, IT FEELS LIKE I AM SIMPLY WAITING AND BIDING MY TIME. THERE IS NOTHING TO DO AND NOWHERE TO GO. HOWEVER I HAVE A SENSE OF SADNESS AND A FEELING OF UNFULFILLMENT.\nPLEASE COMMENT.\nJay, it is one of the most significant moments in the life of man, when he feels that he has run out of ambitions and is simply waiting, not knowing for what.\nThis is the moment when enlightenment is nearest.\nEnlightenment is not a goal. It is not there, far away, that you have to reach to it. You cannot make an ambition of enlightenment: that is the sure way to miss it.\nEnlightenment happens in this gap, when all your ambitions are finished, you don’t know what to do, where to go. In this silence – because there is no turmoil of desire, no hankering for ambition – enlightenment happens of its own accord. It is a by-product, not a goal.\nAnd that’s why you are feeling sad, unfulfilled; although all the ambitions are finished... why should one feel unfulfilled? There must be something in life which is not part of the ambitious mind, without which one cannot feel fulfilled. You can fulfill all your desires, all your ambitions – still you will feel unfulfilled.\nIn fact you will feel unfulfilled more than those who are still running after desires, because at least for them there is hope that tomorrow they will reach the goal. Today may be empty, but the illusion, the hallucination of tomorrow keeps today in a certain way hidden from them. But now for you there is nothing which can hide your reality.\nYou are unfulfilled.\nSo one fundamental thing is very clear: that even if all the ambitions are fulfilled, man is not fulfilled. There is something which is not an ambition, and unless you achieve it – and it is not an achievement – unless it happens to you, the unfulfillment will make you sad.\nThis situation happens to very fortunate people; otherwise everybody is running after desires, and there are so many things in life to do. There is no time to feel unfulfillment, there is no time to feel sadness. The hope for tomorrow dispels all sadness.\nBut now you don’t have any hope for tomorrow. Only today is with you, and it is good that you are waiting, not knowing for what. If you are waiting knowingly for something, that is desire, then the mind is playing a game with you. If you are simply waiting, you have come to the end of the road. There is nowhere to go, what can you do except wait? But wait for what?\nIf you can answer, “I am waiting for this or that,” you will miss enlightenment. Then your waiting is not pure. Then it is not simply waiting. If you can be clear about it, that it is a pure waiting which is not addressed to anything, to any object, it is the right situation in which enlightenment happens.\nSo you are in a beautiful state, unaware of it, because pure waiting and sadness... one cannot see what is beautiful about it. Only the awakened ones can see what is beautiful about it. This is the situation in which, as a by-product, you wake up. Otherwise life remains a spiritual sleep. All desires and ambitions are nothing but dreams in this sleep.\nSo Chuang Tzu, one of the most absurd but one of the most significant mystics, has a beautiful parable. One morning he wakes up very sad. His disciples ask him what has happened. He said, “Something has happened, and I don’t think any of you will be of any help – but still I will tell you; you can try to help me.\n“In the night I dreamed that I have become a butterfly.” They all laughed. They said, “There is no need to worry about it. It was only a dream.”\nChuang Tzu said, “First listen to the whole thing, that is only the half part. Now I am awake, and wondering perhaps if the butterfly has gone to sleep and is dreaming that he is Chuang Tzu. My problem is whether I am Chuang Tzu who dreamed to be a butterfly, or I am a butterfly who is dreaming to be Chuang Tzu.”\nThey all fell silent. Logically there seems to be no way. Chuang Tzu’s chief disciple, Lieh Tzu, was out. As he came in people were sitting sadly, the master was sitting sadly. He enquired of a disciple, “What is the matter? What has happened?” The disciple told him the story; he said, “Don’t be worried, I will put him right.”\nAnd he went close to him and threw a bucket full of cold water into his eyes. And Chuang Tzu said, “That’s perfectly right, that’s the answer. But if you were not here.… Today I was lost. Now I know that I am Chuang Tzu; you need not bring another bucket, the water is too cold.”\nLieh Tzu said, “When I am out you should not do any such thing. These people don’t understand you. They were all puzzled, and they were all sad that their master is sad, and all that is needed is cold water so you wake up, whoever you are – a butterfly or Chuang Tzu does not matter – wake up! From any point, either from being a butterfly or from being a Chuang Tzu. All that is needed is WAKE UP! Who cares who you are? We care... your wakefulness, that is our concern.”\nA sadness, a deep unfulfillment, ordinarily will not look something glorious, not something to be proud of, but I say to you that it is something to be proud of. Just remain in your sadness. Don’t try to change it into something else. Remain in your waiting – don’t try to give it an object.\nA pure waiting attracts the ultimate experience we call enlightenment to it. One has not to go to enlightenment as a goal.\nEnlightenment comes to you when you are ripe, and this is the kind of ripeness which is necessary.\nIn the West it is happening to many people, but they do not know, because in the West Lieh Tzu has not entered yet. They are sad, in deep anguish; they are drowning themselves in alcohol, in drugs, in perverted sexualities – they are trying to forget their sadness in all kinds of things. They are trying to find ways somehow to make an object for their waiting.\nPerhaps they may become religious, and they may start looking for God; but remember, all those who are waiting for God are waiting for Godot.\nI used to think that Godot must be a German word – it sounds German. It hits like a German word. I used to think it must be German for God and that was exactly the message in the book WAITING FOR GODOT. Nobody has seen Godot, nobody knows about him. Two persons are waiting, but just to wait for nothing is the most difficult thing in the world.\nSo they have imagined themselves... and they have helped each other, and one says to the other, “I think he must be coming.”\nHe says, “I also think. It is already late.” And nobody knows about whom they are talking, but nobody wants to bring up the question, “About whom you are talking?” – because they are both afraid that if\nthe question is raised then their wound will be opened, that there is only waiting and it is for no one, and it will be very sad.\nSo it is good. And they go on talking...\n“This is not right, this is not gentlemanly – promising and then not coming.”\nAnd finally one gets up and says, “I am fed up with this waiting. I am going to look for him – where is he? What is preventing him from coming?”\nThe other says, “Where are you going, leaving me alone here? I am also coming with you.” The whole dialogue starts with no base, but they both get engaged in it.\nSo I thought it can only be God. I asked my German sannyasin, the oldest German sannyasin, Haridas, “Is ‘Godot’ the German word for God?”\nHe said, “No! the German word for God is ‘Gott’.”\nI said, “Even better – already got! No question of waiting. In Godot there is some possibility to wait. God is a faraway goal, but Gott...?” Only Germans have got it. Nobody else has the guts to say that.\nA few will become religious and start waiting for Gott. A few may start philosophizing, that life is meaningless, that life is nothing but anguish, that it is nausea. And the beauty is that Jean-Paul Sartre, who was continuously saying, “Life is meaningless, just anxiety, anguish, nausea” – he also wrote a book titled NAUSEA – he lived long. Then why go on living if life is just nausea – to write a book about it? If it is meaningless, to argue about it? To get a Nobel Prize for it?\nThat reminds me of Zeno, one Greek philosopher, a very sharp logician. He has left puzzles which have not been solved in two thousand years. And I don’t think there is any way to solve them. The man has a tremendous mind for looking at things in such a way that he will find puzzles everywhere.\nAnd he preached before Jean-Paul Sartre, two thousand years before him, that life is meaningless, but he was more logical. He said, “Suicide is the only logical conclusion.”\nMany of his disciples committed suicide, and he himself lived for ninety years! And when he was dying, somebody asked, “This is strange. You preach suicide and many of your closest followers have committed suicide when they were young, and you have lived to ninety.” And in those days to live to ninety was very rare. “What is your answer?”\nHe said, “I had to live, to preach my philosophy, to teach people that life is nothing, and the only way out is to commit suicide. It was such a burden, but a duty has to be fulfilled. I could not commit suicide, because that would have been destructive to my philosophy and its propagation.”\nHe is saying he lived just to teach people that they should commit suicide.\nMany intelligent people are committing suicide. Those who cannot gather courage to commit suicide go mad. Either there are drugs or madness or suicide or a superstitious religion and creating a bogus\nidea of God far away, just to give you something to wait for; otherwise it seems like an open wound, and there is no way for it to be healed.\nJay, what I am saying is totally different from what is happening in the West. What I am saying is what has happened in the East in the past ten thousand years, whenever a man has come to such a point that all ambitions are useless – he has lived them, and found that it was not worth it; he reached the goal that he wanted and then found that there was nothing to be found, that it was only a hallucination, an oasis that looked to be real from far away – but as he came closer and closer, it disappeared, and there was only desert.\nThe East has used it in a different way. Not a single philosopher has preached for suicide. Not a single man in this state has gone mad, or has turned towards drugs. But for centuries it has been accepted as the most potential moment in life. If you can just wait, without waiting for anything; just wait – pure waiting.Let the sadness be there, let the unfulfillment be there – they cannot stop your\nenlightenment.\nOnly one thing can stop your enlightenment, and that is if you make some object for your waiting. If the waiting is pure, enlightenment is going to happen, and with its happening there is fulfillment, and there is great rejoicing and life has come to its flowering.\nThat’s why I say this is a tremendously beautiful moment. Don’t miss it.\nAs far as your love for sailing is concerned, that is not a distraction. In fact it can be a beautiful meditation. Being alone in the ocean, no crowd, no society. You can be silent, you can be relaxed, you can be yourself more easily.\nAnd perhaps you are also fortunate, because all the mad politicians of the world may not allow me and my people to live on the earth. Then the only alternative for us is the ocean. And you, Jay, are the only one knowledgeable enough to help in creating the first ocean city of the world.\nI have already asked Hasya to go and see some ocean liners. Jay is finding where ocean liners are available, and what kind will be right for us. And I am thinking more and more that it will be the right thing to do.\nWe can have our own ocean liner – one, two, three big ocean liners; as many sannyasins who want to come can be there for a few months and work and go back again. And we can stay twelve miles away from land, so no problem arises from anybody. And we can be totally ourselves: no disturbance from anybody.\nWhatever methods we want to use, whatever techniques we want to practice, we have our own world.\nSo there is going to be some big responsibility on Jay, to manage at least five thousand people, and slowly we will arrange two, three more ocean liners, so when our festival time comes, twenty thousand, twenty-five thousand people can be there, and a big oil platform, on which twenty-five thousand people can sit and dance and sing – out of the world. And that will be our total no to all kinds of superstitions and to all kinds of stupidities, for which we have to make compromises unnecessarily just to live on the earth.\nAnd it may be the beginning. Many other groups may start thinking in the same way, “Why bother with the earth. Why not move into the ocean?”\nSo our city will be the first ocean city in the whole of history, and I am certain other cities will follow. So your love for sailing has come handy in time. You have come here right on time.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nMOST OF MY LIFE I HAVE BEEN LIVING BEHIND SOMEONE. I HAVE BEEN SWITCHING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN PUTTING MYSELF ON THE LINE AND HIDING BEHIND SOMEONE OR SOMETHING. I ONLY HIDE WHEN IT GETS TOO HOT, SO I STAY SAFE. BUT THIS IS NOT WORKING ANYMORE FOR ME AS I REALIZE WHAT I AM DOING, AND IT FEELS THAT IT IS TIME FOR ME TO DECIDE TO DO ONE OR THE OTHER.\nCAN YOU PLEASE COMMENT?\nDON’T see the problem: if it is too hot one has to hide somewhere or other, behind someone or other – and when it is cool, come out!\nThere is no question of deciding that you will always be out, even if it becomes ice cold, or you will always remain behind, whether there is any need to hide or not. There is no reason at all to decide.\nJust move and remain flexible. When it is hot it is perfectly good to open your umbrella. Are you against the umbrella or what? There are all kinds of umbrellas. And when it is not hot, close the umbrella.\nLife should be taken very lightly, but we are brought up in such a way that everything becomes a serious problem. Now what is the problem in it? I don’t see any problem. It is simply intelligent. There are times when you need a shelter, and there are times when you need the open sky.\nSo live according to the moment, without any predecision. In fact predecisions create trouble.\nI was staying in Calcutta in one of my friends’ houses. He believed in Jainism, and he could not eat after sunset, so he told me, “We will discuss later on. The sun is setting, and I have to eat.” The sun had already set – he knew it, I knew it, but there was no point.So rather than eating on the dining\ntable inside, because there it was becoming darker, we had to eat on the terrace, where it was light. After eating I told him, “You are even deceiving your gods.”\nHe said, “What do you mean?”\nI said, “Whether you ate inside on the dining table or outside on the terrace, the time was the same, and the sun had already set. Yes, inside it was a little darker, outside it was a little more light, but the sun was not there. You have seen it setting, I have seen it setting, but I did not want to disturb you.”\n“But,” he said, “one has to make compromises.”\nI said, “You have to make compromises, because you have already accepted certain formulas of life; otherwise there was no problem. If you had not decided that it was religious to eat before sunset, there was no question at all. And this formula was made almost five thousand years before when there was no electricity. Now you live in an air-conditioned palace. It is better lighted inside. The formula was made so that you don’t eat in darkness, and some insect falls in it.”\nAnd it happens in India in villages, where people eat in the night: they don’t have even a small lamputter darkness. You can eat any insect falling, any fly falling – and it was perfectly right at the\ntime. But those people were not aware of electricity.\nNow in an air-conditioned house, where there are no flies, no insects, nothing, and you have light at your hand – as much light as you want – it is simply stupid.the very idea of sun or no sun.\nWhenever you decide beforehand, there is going to be trouble, because life goes on its own way. It has no awareness of your prejudices, your disciplines – and it has no obligation to follow them. And you get into trouble, and then life becomes more and more serious, because you have to make compromises, you feel guilty – that you are weak. If you don’t make compromises you will be broken, you may hurt yourself.\nIn my understanding life is a very simple, playful, light-hearted thing. Don’t disturb it by your seriousness. Move with it.\nSo when it is hot, don’t eat hot-dogs; have a cold drink. When it is cold then change; there is no need to follow the same principle every day forever. That is making people so miserable, because they won’t change. They think to remain unchanging in their principles gives them certain strength. They are wrong. It simply sucks all their strength, they are the weakest people on the earth.\nThey are like small children who have grown up and are still using the pajamas which were made when they were babies. Now they are looking awkward. They are feeling difficulty, they are holding the pajamas all the time, because they are slipping again and again. People are laughing. No, as you grow, your pajamas also should grow; but because pajamas do not grow, you have to change them.\nSo I don’t see any problem in it, but I can see this is not only one person’s situation. Millions of people are living this way. They make a strict discipline and then get into trouble. Nobody is putting them into trouble but their own principles. If they leave them they feel bad, if they follow them they suffer.\nDon’t be too hard on yourself. Be a little more compassionate, a little more loving. So I don’t teach a principled life; I teach you clearly an unprincipled life, a life of intelligence which changes with every change around you. You don’t have a principle that creates a difficulty in changing. Be absolutely unprincipled and just follow life. And there will be no misery in your life.\nYou can live this whole life with so many songs and so many dances, and out of those songs and dances will arise your gratitude. And I call that gratitude your religiousness – gratitude towards existence.\nBut you don’t give a chance for your own life to flower. Your principles are your prisons, and they go on becoming bigger and bigger.\nYou will be surprised to know that for a Buddhist monk there are thirty-three thousand principles to be followed. Now even to remember them is impossible. To follow them means crippling yourself completely. On each step, at each moment you have to consult your holy book: what to do, what not to do.\nJust do whatsoever is pleasant – pleasant to you and pleasant to your surroundings. Just do something which brings a song to you and creates a rhythm around you, of celebration.\nThis life I call a religious life: it has no principles, it has no discipline, it has no laws, it has only one single approach, and that is to live intelligently.\nQuestion 3 BELOVED OSHO,\nLISTENING TO YOU, I HEAR THE CONSTANT ETERNAL MESSAGE OF AWARENESS, RELAXATION, BEING IN THE MOMENT, UNDISTURBED. BECAUSE OF THIS BLESSING FROM YOU, THIS GIFT OF THESE KEYS TO FREEDOM, I FEEL TO DEVOTE ALL HYPNOSIS SESSIONS TO THESE SUGGESTIONS. COUNTING FROM SEVEN TO ONE, REMAINING ALERT, FULLY RELAXED, MOVING INTO THE SILENCE, UNDISTURBED, WATCHING AS THE MIND AND EMOTIONS ARE FURTHER AWAY. THIS HAS BEEN HAPPENING FOR THE PAST TEN DAYS.\nAM I IN TUNE WITH YOUR GUIDANCE? PLEASE COMMENT.\nYES Kaveesha, you are doing very well. Continue. Question 4\nBELOVED OSHO,\nYOU BROUGHT THIS SUTRA OF TILOPA’S TO LIFE IN POONA. WOULD YOU SPEAK ON THIS AGAIN AS WE GO DEEPER AND DEEPER?\nDO NOUGHT WITH THE BODY, BUT RELAX. SHUT FIRM THE MOUTH, AND SILENT REMAIN. EMPTY YOUR MIND, AND THINK OF NOUGHT. DO NOUGHT WITH THE BODY, BUT RELAX.\nTILOPA is one of my most loved ones. His sutras are very small, but have the capacity of an atomic explosion. The first sutra is: as far as the body is concerned, remember only one thing, only one\nword – relaxation. If your body can remain relaxed, more and more, you will be coming closer and closer to home.\nJust whenever you have time simply watch whether your body is relaxed or whether there are some tensions somewhere. Close your eyes and start from your feet, watching inside upwards, and you will find that the knees are tense or the back is tense – whichever part feels tense, just suggest to it, “Please relax.”\nIt is something very fundamental to understand, that the body is always ready to listen to you – you have never talked with it, you have never made any communication with it. You have been in it, you have used it, but you have never thanked it. It serves you, and serves you as intelligently as possible.\nNature knows that it is more intelligent than you are, because all the important things in the body have not been left to you, they have been given to the body. For example, breathing, or heartbeat, or the blood circulating, or the digestion of the food – they have not been left to you; otherwise you would have been in a mess long before.\nIf breathing was left to you, you would have died. There is no possibility of your living, you can forget any moment. Fighting with someone, you can forget breathing. Sleeping in the night, you can forget your heartbeats. How will you remember? And do you know how much work your digestive system is doing? You go on swallowing things and you think you are doing a great job. That swallowing can be done by anybody.\nIn the second world war it happened, one man got a bullet through his throat. He didn’t die, but he could not eat or drink from the throat, the whole passage had to be closed. And the doctors made a small passage by the side of his stomach, with a pipe coming out, and he has to put the food in the pipe, but there was no joy. Even when he was putting in ice-cream... he was very angry.\nHe said, “This is... I don’t taste anything.”\nThen one doctor suggested, “You do one thing. First you taste, then you throw it into the pipe.” And that he did for forty years. He would first chew and enjoy and then throw it in the pipe. The pipe is just as good, because in your body too it is just a pipe and nothing else, it is just hidden behind skin. This poor man’s was just open. And it was better than yours because it could be cleaned and everything.\nThe whole digestive system is doing miracles. The scientists say that if we had to do everything that your small digestive system is doing – a single man’s – we would need a big factory to turn food into blood, to sort out all elements, to send those elements which are needed at certain places. A few elements are needed in the brain, and they have to be sent through the blood stream to the brain. Others are needed somewhere else, to the eyes. Others are needed somewhere else, to the ears, or to the bones, or to the skin, and the body is doing it so perfectly for seventy years, eighty years, ninety years – and you don’t see its wisdom.\nTilopa is saying that with the body, the only thing that people are not doing is relaxation, particularly while meditating. Do not do anything else with body, but just relax; put the whole body’s wisdom into\nrelaxation. Relaxation should become the basement of the temple that you are creating; and the mind should be emptied of all thoughts.\nAnd just by being aware, thoughts start disappearing. There is no need to fight. Your awareness is enough to destroy them. And when the mind is empty, the temple is ready. And inside the temple the only god worth placing is silence.\nSo those three words you have to remember: relaxation, thoughtlessness, silence. And if these three words are no more words to you but become experiences, your life will be transformed.\nPeople like Tilopa are always simple, direct. These are like maxims of physics or chemistry. Not a single word can be added to these sutras, and not a single word can be taken out. He has put exactly the right words in the right proportion in the right sequence. The body is relaxed, the mind is empty, the heart is silent; and then what happens is the knowing, the experiencing of the ultimate reality, of the immortal life of eternity.\nWithout this knowing, we will remain always in fear of death; we will remain always in the clutches of desire; we will remain always in tensions, miseries.\nKnowing oneself, one is freed from everything; not only one is freed from everything, one is freed from oneself too. Only freedom remains.

I SEEM TO HAVE RUN OUT OF AMBITION TO ACHIEVE ANYTHING FURTHER. EVEN
ENLIGHTENMENT APPEARS TO BE A REMOTE AND IMPOSSIBLE GOAL, OUTSIDE THE
REALM OF MY UNDERSTANDING.</p><p><br></p><p>I LOVE TO SEE YOU AND TO BE WITH YOU AND I LOVE TO SAIL. APART FROM
THESE, IT FEELS LIKE I AM SIMPLY WAITING AND BIDING MY TIME. THERE IS
NOTHING TO DO AND NOWHERE TO GO. HOWEVER I HAVE A SENSE OF SADNESS AND A
FEELING OF UNFULFILLMENT.</p><p><br></p><p>PLEASE COMMENT.</p><p><br></p><p>Jay, it is one of the most significant moments in the life of man,
when he feels that he has run out of ambitions and is simply waiting,
not knowing for what.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the moment when enlightenment is nearest.</p><p><br></p><p>Enlightenment is not a goal. It is not there, far away, that you have
to reach to it. You cannot make an ambition of enlightenment: that is
the sure way to miss it.</p><p>Enlightenment happens in this gap, when all your ambitions are
finished, you don’t know what to do, where to go. In this silence –
because there is no turmoil of desire, no hankering for ambition –
enlightenment happens of its own accord. It is a by-product, not a
goal.</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s why you are feeling sad, unfulfilled; although all the
ambitions are finished... why should one feel unfulfilled? There must be
something in life which is not part of the ambitious mind, without which
one cannot feel fulfilled. You can fulfill all your desires, all your
ambitions – still you will feel unfulfilled.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact you will feel unfulfilled more than those who are still
running after desires, because at least for them there is hope that
tomorrow they will reach the goal. Today may be empty, but the illusion,
the hallucination of tomorrow keeps today in a certain way hidden from
them. But now for you there is nothing which can hide your reality.</p><p><br></p><p>You are unfulfilled.</p><p><br></p><p>So one fundamental thing is very clear: that even if all the
ambitions are fulfilled, man is not fulfilled. There is something which
is not an ambition, and unless you achieve it – and it is not an
achievement – unless it happens to you, the unfulfillment will make you
sad.</p><p><br></p><p>This situation happens to very fortunate people; otherwise everybody
is running after desires, and there are so many things in life to do.
There is no time to feel unfulfillment, there is no time to feel
sadness. The hope for tomorrow dispels all sadness.</p><p><br></p><p>But now you don’t have any hope for tomorrow. Only today is with you,
and it is good that you are waiting, not knowing for what. If you are
waiting knowingly for something, that is desire, then the mind is
playing a game with you. If you are simply waiting, you have come to the
end of the road. There is nowhere to go, what can you do except wait?
But wait for what?</p><p><br></p><p>If you can answer, “I am waiting for this or that,” you will miss
enlightenment. Then your waiting is not pure. Then it is not simply
waiting. If you can be clear about it, that it is a pure waiting which
is not addressed to anything, to any object, it is the right situation
in which enlightenment happens.</p><p><br></p><p>So you are in a beautiful state, unaware of it, because pure waiting
and sadness... one cannot see what is beautiful about it. Only the
awakened ones can see what is beautiful about it. This is the situation
in which, as a by-product, you wake up. Otherwise life remains a
spiritual sleep. All desires and ambitions are nothing but dreams in
this sleep.</p><p><br></p><p>So Chuang Tzu, one of the most absurd but one of the most significant
mystics, has a beautiful parable. One morning he wakes up very sad. His
disciples ask him what has happened. He said, “Something has happened,
and I don’t think any of you will be of any help – but still I will tell
you; you can try to help me.</p><p><br></p><p>“In the night I dreamed that I have become a butterfly.” They all
laughed. They said, “There is no need to worry about it. It was only a
dream.”</p><p>Chuang Tzu said, “First listen to the whole thing, that is only the
half part. Now I am awake, and wondering perhaps if the butterfly has
gone to sleep and is dreaming that he is Chuang Tzu. My problem is
whether I am Chuang Tzu who dreamed to be a butterfly, or I am a
butterfly who is dreaming to be Chuang Tzu.”</p><p><br></p><p>They all fell silent. Logically there seems to be no way. Chuang
Tzu’s chief disciple, Lieh Tzu, was out. As he came in people were
sitting sadly, the master was sitting sadly. He enquired of a disciple,
“What is the matter? What has happened?” The disciple told him the
story; he said, “Don’t be worried, I will put him right.”</p><p><br></p><p>And he went close to him and threw a bucket full of cold water into
his eyes. And Chuang Tzu said, “That’s perfectly right, that’s the
answer. But if you were not here.… Today I was lost. Now I know that I
am Chuang Tzu; you need not bring another bucket, the water is too
cold.”</p><p><br></p><p>Lieh Tzu said, “When I am out you should not do any such thing. These
people don’t understand you. They were all puzzled, and they were all
sad that their master is sad, and all that is needed is cold water so
you wake up, whoever you are – a butterfly or Chuang Tzu does not matter
– wake up! From any point, either from being a butterfly or from being a
Chuang Tzu. All that is needed is WAKE UP! Who cares who you are? We
care... your wakefulness, that is our concern.”</p><p><br></p><p>A sadness, a deep unfulfillment, ordinarily will not look something
glorious, not something to be proud of, but I say to you that it is
something to be proud of. Just remain in your sadness. Don’t try to
change it into something else. Remain in your waiting – don’t try to
give it an object.</p><p><br></p><p>A pure waiting attracts the ultimate experience we call enlightenment
to it. One has not to go to enlightenment as a goal.</p><p><br></p><p>Enlightenment comes to you when you are ripe, and this is the kind of
ripeness which is necessary.</p><p><br></p><p>In the West it is happening to many people, but they do not know,
because in the West Lieh Tzu has not entered yet. They are sad, in deep
anguish; they are drowning themselves in alcohol, in drugs, in perverted
sexualities – they are trying to forget their sadness in all kinds of
things. They are trying to find ways somehow to make an object for their
waiting.</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps they may become religious, and they may start looking for
God; but remember, all those who are waiting for God are waiting for
Godot.</p><p><br></p><p>I used to think that Godot must be a German word – it sounds German.
It hits like a German word. I used to think it must be German for God
and that was exactly the message in the book WAITING FOR GODOT. Nobody
has seen Godot, nobody knows about him. Two persons are waiting, but
just to wait for nothing is the most difficult thing in the world.</p><p><br></p><p>So they have imagined themselves... and they have helped each other,
and one says to the other, “I think he must be coming.”</p><p><br></p><p>He says, “I also think. It is already late.” And nobody knows about
whom they are talking, but nobody wants to bring up the question, “About
whom you are talking?” – because they are both afraid that if</p><p>the question is raised then their wound will be opened, that there is
only waiting and it is for no one, and it will be very sad.</p><p><br></p><p>So it is good. And they go on talking...</p><p><br></p><p>“This is not right, this is not gentlemanly – promising and then not
coming.”</p><p><br></p><p>And finally one gets up and says, “I am fed up with this waiting. I
am going to look for him – where is he? What is preventing him from
coming?”</p><p><br></p><p>The other says, “Where are you going, leaving me alone here? I am
also coming with you.” The whole dialogue starts with no base, but they
both get engaged in it.</p><p>So I thought it can only be God. I asked my German sannyasin, the
oldest German sannyasin, Haridas, “Is ‘Godot’ the German word for
God?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “No! the German word for God is ‘Gott’.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Even better – already got! No question of waiting. In Godot
there is some possibility to wait. God is a faraway goal, but Gott...?”
Only Germans have got it. Nobody else has the guts to say that.</p><p><br></p><p>A few will become religious and start waiting for Gott. A few may
start philosophizing, that life is meaningless, that life is nothing but
anguish, that it is nausea. And the beauty is that Jean-Paul Sartre, who
was continuously saying, “Life is meaningless, just anxiety, anguish,
nausea” – he also wrote a book titled NAUSEA – he lived long. Then why
go on living if life is just nausea – to write a book about it? If it is
meaningless, to argue about it? To get a Nobel Prize for it?</p><p><br></p><p>That reminds me of Zeno, one Greek philosopher, a very sharp
logician. He has left puzzles which have not been solved in two thousand
years. And I don’t think there is any way to solve them. The man has a
tremendous mind for looking at things in such a way that he will find
puzzles everywhere.</p><p><br></p><p>And he preached before Jean-Paul Sartre, two thousand years before
him, that life is meaningless, but he was more logical. He said,
“Suicide is the only logical conclusion.”</p><p><br></p><p>Many of his disciples committed suicide, and he himself lived for
ninety years! And when he was dying, somebody asked, “This is strange.
You preach suicide and many of your closest followers have committed
suicide when they were young, and you have lived to ninety.” And in
those days to live to ninety was very rare. “What is your answer?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I had to live, to preach my philosophy, to teach people
that life is nothing, and the only way out is to commit suicide. It was
such a burden, but a duty has to be fulfilled. I could not commit
suicide, because that would have been destructive to my philosophy and
its propagation.”</p><p><br></p><p>He is saying he lived just to teach people that they should commit
suicide.</p><p><br></p><p>Many intelligent people are committing suicide. Those who cannot
gather courage to commit suicide go mad. Either there are drugs or
madness or suicide or a superstitious religion and creating a bogus</p><p>idea of God far away, just to give you something to wait for;
otherwise it seems like an open wound, and there is no way for it to be
healed.</p><p><br></p><p>Jay, what I am saying is totally different from what is happening in
the West. What I am saying is what has happened in the East in the past
ten thousand years, whenever a man has come to such a point that all
ambitions are useless – he has lived them, and found that it was not
worth it; he reached the goal that he wanted and then found that there
was nothing to be found, that it was only a hallucination, an oasis that
looked to be real from far away – but as he came closer and closer, it
disappeared, and there was only desert.</p><p><br></p><p>The East has used it in a different way. Not a single philosopher has
preached for suicide. Not a single man in this state has gone mad, or
has turned towards drugs. But for centuries it has been accepted as the
most potential moment in life. If you can just wait, without waiting for
anything; just wait – pure waiting.<span class=s4></span>Let the
sadness be there, let the unfulfillment be there – they cannot stop
your</p><p>enlightenment.</p><p><br></p><p>Only one thing can stop your enlightenment, and that is if you make
some object for your waiting. If the waiting is pure, enlightenment is
going to happen, and with its happening there is fulfillment, and there
is great rejoicing and life has come to its flowering.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why I say this is a tremendously beautiful moment. Don’t miss
it.</p><p><br></p><p>As far as your love for sailing is concerned, that is not a
distraction. In fact it can be a beautiful meditation. Being alone in
the ocean, no crowd, no society. You can be silent, you can be relaxed,
you can be yourself more easily.</p><p><br></p><p>And perhaps you are also fortunate, because all the mad politicians
of the world may not allow me and my people to live on the earth. Then
the only alternative for us is the ocean. And you, Jay, are the only one
knowledgeable enough to help in creating the first ocean city of the
world.</p><p><br></p><p>I have already asked Hasya to go and see some ocean liners. Jay is
finding where ocean liners are available, and what kind will be right
for us. And I am thinking more and more that it will be the right thing
to do.</p><p><br></p><p>We can have our own ocean liner – one, two, three big ocean liners;
as many sannyasins who want to come can be there for a few months and
work and go back again. And we can stay twelve miles away from land, so
no problem arises from anybody. And we can be totally ourselves: no
disturbance from anybody.</p><p><br></p><p>Whatever methods we want to use, whatever techniques we want to
practice, we have our own world.</p><p><br></p><p>So there is going to be some big responsibility on Jay, to manage at
least five thousand people, and slowly we will arrange two, three more
ocean liners, so when our festival time comes, twenty thousand,
twenty-five thousand people can be there, and a big oil platform, on
which twenty-five thousand people can sit and dance and sing – out of
the world. And that will be our total no to all kinds of superstitions
and to all kinds of stupidities, for which we have to make compromises
unnecessarily just to live on the earth.</p><p>And it may be the beginning. Many other groups may start thinking in
the same way, “Why bother with the earth. Why not move into the
ocean?”</p><p><br></p><p>So our city will be the first ocean city in the whole of history, and
I am certain other cities will follow. So your love for sailing has come
handy in time. You have come here right on time.</p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>MOST OF MY LIFE I HAVE BEEN LIVING BEHIND SOMEONE. I HAVE BEEN
SWITCHING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN PUTTING MYSELF ON THE LINE AND HIDING
BEHIND SOMEONE OR SOMETHING. I ONLY HIDE WHEN IT GETS TOO HOT, SO I STAY
SAFE. BUT THIS IS NOT WORKING ANYMORE FOR ME AS I REALIZE WHAT I AM
DOING, AND IT FEELS THAT IT IS TIME FOR ME TO DECIDE TO DO ONE OR THE
OTHER.</p><p><br></p><p>CAN YOU PLEASE COMMENT?</p><p><br></p><p>DON’T see the problem: if it is too hot one has to hide somewhere or
other, behind someone or other – and when it is cool, come out!</p><p><br></p><p>There is no question of deciding that you will always be out, even if
it becomes ice cold, or you will always remain behind, whether there is
any need to hide or not. There is no reason at all to decide.</p><p><br></p><p>Just move and remain flexible. When it is hot it is perfectly good to
open your umbrella. Are you against the umbrella or what? There are all
kinds of umbrellas. And when it is not hot, close the umbrella.</p><p><br></p><p>Life should be taken very lightly, but we are brought up in such a
way that everything becomes a serious problem. Now what is the problem
in it? I don’t see any problem. It is simply intelligent. There are
times when you need a shelter, and there are times when you need the
open sky.</p><p><br></p><p>So live according to the moment, without any predecision. In fact
predecisions create trouble.</p><p><br></p><p>I was staying in Calcutta in one of my friends’ houses. He believed
in Jainism, and he could not eat after sunset, so he told me, “We will
discuss later on. The sun is setting, and I have to eat.” The sun had
already set – he knew it, I knew it, but there was no point.<span class=s4></span>So rather than eating on the dining</p><p>table inside, because there it was becoming darker, we had to eat on
the terrace, where it was light. After eating I told him, “You are even
deceiving your gods.”</p><p>He said, “What do you mean?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Whether you ate inside on the dining table or outside on the
terrace, the time was the same, and the sun had already set. Yes, inside
it was a little darker, outside it was a little more light, but the sun
was not there. You have seen it setting, I have seen it setting, but I
did not want to disturb you.”</p><p>“But,” he said, “one has to make compromises.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “You have to make compromises, because you have already
accepted certain formulas of life; otherwise there was no problem. If
you had not decided that it was religious to eat before sunset, there
was no question at all. And this formula was made almost five thousand
years before when there was no electricity. Now you live in an
air-conditioned palace. It is better lighted inside. The formula was
made so that you don’t eat in darkness, and some insect falls in
it.<span class=s4></span>”</p><p><br></p><p>And it happens in India in villages, where people eat in the night:
they don’t have even a small lamp<span class=s4></span>utter darkness.
You can eat any insect falling, any fly falling – and it was perfectly
right at the</p><p>time. But those people were not aware of electricity.</p><p><br></p><p>Now in an air-conditioned house, where there are no flies, no
insects, nothing, and you have light at your hand – as much light as you
want – it is simply stupid.<span class=s4></span>the very idea of sun
or no sun.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever you decide beforehand, there is going to be trouble, because
life goes on its own way. It has no awareness of your prejudices, your
disciplines – and it has no obligation to follow them. And you get into
trouble, and then life becomes more and more serious, because you have
to make compromises, you feel guilty – that you are weak. If you don’t
make compromises you will be broken, you may hurt yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>In my understanding life is a very simple, playful, light-hearted
thing. Don’t disturb it by your seriousness. Move with it.</p><p><br></p><p>So when it is hot, don’t eat hot-dogs; have a cold drink. When it is
cold then change; there is no need to follow the same principle every
day forever. That is making people so miserable, because they won’t
change. They think to remain unchanging in their principles gives them
certain strength. They are wrong. It simply sucks all their strength,
they are the weakest people on the earth.</p><p><br></p><p>They are like small children who have grown up and are still using
the pajamas which were made when they were babies. Now they are looking
awkward. They are feeling difficulty, they are holding the pajamas all
the time, because they are slipping again and again. People are
laughing. No, as you grow, your pajamas also should grow; but because
pajamas do not grow, you have to change them.</p><p><br></p><p>So I don’t see any problem in it, but I can see this is not only one
person’s situation. Millions of people are living this way. They make a
strict discipline and then get into trouble. Nobody is putting them into
trouble but their own principles. If they leave them they feel bad, if
they follow them they suffer.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t be too hard on yourself. Be a little more compassionate, a
little more loving. So I don’t teach a principled life; I teach you
clearly an unprincipled life, a life of intelligence which changes with
every change around you. You don’t have a principle that creates a
difficulty in changing. Be absolutely unprincipled and just follow life.
And there will be no misery in your life.</p><p><br></p><p>You can live this whole life with so many songs and so many dances,
and out of those songs and dances will arise your gratitude. And I call
that gratitude your religiousness – gratitude towards existence.</p><p>But you don’t give a chance for your own life to flower. Your
principles are your prisons, and they go on becoming bigger and
bigger.</p><p><br></p><p>You will be surprised to know that for a Buddhist monk there are
thirty-three thousand principles to be followed. Now even to remember
them is impossible. To follow them means crippling yourself completely.
On each step, at each moment you have to consult your holy book: what to
do, what not to do.</p><p><br></p><p>Just do whatsoever is pleasant – pleasant to you and pleasant to your
surroundings. Just do something which brings a song to you and creates a
rhythm around you, of celebration.</p><p><br></p><p>This life I call a religious life: it has no principles, it has no
discipline, it has no laws, it has only one single approach, and that is
to live intelligently.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 3 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>LISTENING TO YOU, I HEAR THE CONSTANT ETERNAL MESSAGE OF AWARENESS,
RELAXATION, BEING IN THE MOMENT, UNDISTURBED. BECAUSE OF THIS BLESSING
FROM YOU, THIS GIFT OF THESE KEYS TO FREEDOM, I FEEL TO DEVOTE ALL
HYPNOSIS SESSIONS TO THESE SUGGESTIONS. COUNTING FROM SEVEN TO ONE,
REMAINING ALERT, FULLY RELAXED, MOVING INTO THE SILENCE, UNDISTURBED,
WATCHING AS THE MIND AND EMOTIONS ARE FURTHER AWAY. THIS HAS BEEN
HAPPENING FOR THE PAST TEN DAYS.</p><p><br></p><p>AM I IN TUNE WITH YOUR GUIDANCE? PLEASE COMMENT.</p><p>YES Kaveesha, you are doing very well. Continue. Question 4</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>YOU BROUGHT THIS SUTRA OF TILOPA’S TO LIFE IN POONA. WOULD YOU SPEAK
ON THIS AGAIN AS WE GO DEEPER AND DEEPER?</p><p><br></p><p>DO NOUGHT WITH THE BODY, BUT RELAX. SHUT FIRM THE MOUTH, AND SILENT
REMAIN. EMPTY YOUR MIND, AND THINK OF NOUGHT. DO NOUGHT WITH THE BODY,
BUT RELAX.</p><p>TILOPA is one of my most loved ones. His sutras are very small, but
have the capacity of an atomic explosion. The first sutra is: as far as
the body is concerned, remember only one thing, only one</p><p>word – relaxation. If your body can remain relaxed, more and more,
you will be coming closer and closer to home.</p><p><br></p><p>Just whenever you have time simply watch whether your body is relaxed
or whether there are some tensions somewhere. Close your eyes and start
from your feet, watching inside upwards, and you will find that the
knees are tense or the back is tense – whichever part feels tense, just
suggest to it, “Please relax.”</p><p><br></p><p>It is something very fundamental to understand, that the body is
always ready to listen to you – you have never talked with it, you have
never made any communication with it. You have been in it, you have used
it, but you have never thanked it. It serves you, and serves you as
intelligently as possible.</p><p><br></p><p>Nature knows that it is more intelligent than you are, because all
the important things in the body have not been left to you, they have
been given to the body. For example, breathing, or heartbeat, or the
blood circulating, or the digestion of the food – they have not been
left to you; otherwise you would have been in a mess long before.</p><p><br></p><p>If breathing was left to you, you would have died. There is no
possibility of your living, you can forget any moment. Fighting with
someone, you can forget breathing. Sleeping in the night, you can forget
your heartbeats. How will you remember? And do you know how much work
your digestive system is doing? You go on swallowing things and you
think you are doing a great job. That swallowing can be done by
anybody.</p><p><br></p><p>In the second world war it happened, one man got a bullet through his
throat. He didn’t die, but he could not eat or drink from the throat,
the whole passage had to be closed. And the doctors made a small passage
by the side of his stomach, with a pipe coming out, and he has to put
the food in the pipe, but there was no joy. Even when he was putting in
ice-cream... he was very angry.</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “This is... I don’t taste anything.”</p><p><br></p><p>Then one doctor suggested, “You do one thing. First you taste, then
you throw it into the pipe.” And that he did for forty years. He would
first chew and enjoy and then throw it in the pipe. The pipe is just as
good, because in your body too it is just a pipe and nothing else, it is
just hidden behind skin. This poor man’s was just open. And it was
better than yours because it could be cleaned and everything.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole digestive system is doing miracles. The scientists say that
if we had to do everything that your small digestive system is doing – a
single man’s – we would need a big factory to turn food into blood, to
sort out all elements, to send those elements which are needed at
certain places. A few elements are needed in the brain, and they have to
be sent through the blood stream to the brain. Others are needed
somewhere else, to the eyes. Others are needed somewhere else, to the
ears, or to the bones, or to the skin, and the body is doing it so
perfectly for seventy years, eighty years, ninety years – and you don’t
see its wisdom.</p><p><br></p><p>Tilopa is saying that with the body, the only thing that people are
not doing is relaxation, particularly while meditating. Do not do
anything else with body, but just relax; put the whole body’s wisdom
into</p><p>relaxation. Relaxation should become the basement of the temple that
you are creating; and the mind should be emptied of all thoughts.</p><p>And just by being aware, thoughts start disappearing. There is no
need to fight. Your awareness is enough to destroy them. And when the
mind is empty, the temple is ready. And inside the temple the only god
worth placing is silence.</p><p>So those three words you have to remember: relaxation,
thoughtlessness, silence. And if these three words are no more words to
you but become experiences, your life will be transformed.</p><p>People like Tilopa are always simple, direct. These are like maxims
of physics or chemistry. Not a single word can be added to these sutras,
and not a single word can be taken out. He has put exactly the right
words in the right proportion in the right sequence. The body is
relaxed, the mind is empty, the heart is silent; and then what happens
is the knowing, the experiencing of the ultimate reality, of the
immortal life of eternity.</p><p>Without this knowing, we will remain always in fear of death; we will
remain always in the clutches of desire; we will remain always in
tensions, miseries.</p><p>Knowing oneself, one is freed from everything; not only one is freed
from everything, one is freed from oneself too. Only freedom remains.
This freedom is the cherished idea of all the awakened ones.</p><p>Tilopa comes into the same category as Gautam Buddha, Mahakashyap,
Bodhidharma, Chuang Tzu.</p><p>If one is going to get the essence of all the awakened ones, just to
understand Tilopa is enough. His sutras will give you all the secrets
possible. You need not wander here and there.</p><p>Question 5 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>SIGMUND FREUD HAS SAID THAT A SPOILED CHILD, ESPECIALLY ONE WHO IS
LOVED BY THE MOTHER, HAS AN OPEN ROAD TO SUCCESS.</p><p>BUDDHA WAS SPOILED VERY MUCH.</p><p><br></p><p>JESUS – HAVING SUCH A JEWISH MOTHER – WAS SPOILED TOO.</p><p><br></p><p>YOU WERE COMPLETELY SPOILED BY YOUR PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS.</p><p><br></p><p>IT SEEMS THAT SPOILING AND ENLIGHTENMENT WALK TOGETHER
HAND-IN-HAND.</p><p><br></p><p>FOR YEARS YOU HAVE BEEN SPOILING US SO MUCH, AND NOW IT SEEMS THAT WE
ARE COMPLETELY, TOTALLY SPOILED.</p><p>ARE WE READY FOR ENLIGHTENMENT, OR WILL YOU SPOIL US EVEN MORE?</p><p><br></p><p>JUST a little bit more!</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part14>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

IT STARTED BY MY IMAGINING THAT MY BED DISAPPEARED, THEN MY ROOM, THE HOUSE, THE TOWN, ALL PEOPLE, THE COUNTRY, THE WHOLE GLOBE... EVERYTHING IN THE UNIVERSE FADED. THERE WAS UTTER DARKNESS AND SILENCE; I WAS JUST FLOATING IN SPACE.\nTHE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE LAST MATERIAL THINGS CREATED A TREMENDOUS WHIRLING AROUND ME. I WAS SUCKED INTO IT; THIS FEELING WAS ALMOST SEXUAL. IT CREATED A SWEET, PULLING SENSATION IN MY BELLY, WHICH COULD LAST FOR SECONDS OR SOMETIMES FOR ONE TO TWO MINUTES.\nI NEVER TALKED TO MY PARENTS OR ANYBODY ELSE ABOUT IT, BECAUSE I FEARED THEY MIGHT THINK ME MAD.\nOSHO, WHAT WAS THIS EXPERIENCE?\nThere is a tantra method in which one does exactly the same exercise as you are describing from your childhood. For children it is easy, but for grown-ups also, it is not impossible. It is simply an exercise of the imagination. But that does not mean that what you experience is unreal.\nFirst, let me tell you about a tantra method. It is for all ages. It has to be done in the dark, because in the dark you cannot see things, so it is easy to imagine that they have disappeared.\nLying down is the most appropriate posture for it. Because man became man, attained a little bit of consciousness by standing up on his two feet – he became vertical – the blood stream now reaches less to his head than when he is lying horizontal. Lying down, the blood reaches in a greater quantity with more speed just because of gravitation. When you stand up, the blood has to go against gravitation; its flow is slowed down, its quantity is cut.\nThat’s why no other animal has a conscious mind. Even when walking, a cow, a horse, a buffalo – they are horizontal. Their heads are receiving as much blood as any other part of the body. They cannot grow the very subtle, very small cells which enable man to think.\nBut there is a possibility – and as far as I am concerned it is a certainty – that animals do imagine. They don’t have a conscious mind, but they do have an unconscious mind.\nWatching a dog you can see it. A dog is sleeping nearby; you can just watch: once in a while he will try to catch an imaginary fly, a fly which is not there. What is he doing? He imagined it. That catching of the fly which is not there must have been to him a reality in his imagination. And, of course, dogs think of flies just as men think of women.\nNobody has tried to explore the unconscious of the animals. We are not even finished with man, so the question of animals does not arise. They are far back in the queue, standing and waiting. But the wisdom of people has always attributed a certain intelligence to animals.\nAesop’s fables are fables about man, but all the actors are animals. panch tantra, the ancientmost book of stories, has fables which talk about man because they are written by man, but the actors, participants... everybody is an animal. And in every country there are ancient books in which animals are taking part, just like man. For example, in one of Aesop’s fables, a little goat – a kid – is drinking water from a mountain stream, and the king of the animals, the lion, comes by. It is breakfast time, and the kid is just a perfect breakfast. But even animals have to find excuses first, so the lion says to the goat, “Kid, you are very arrogant; you see the emperor of the whole animal kingdom, and yet you are muddying the water which I am going to drink.”\nThe poor kid says, “Uncle, the stream is going this way. I cannot make the water muddy for you; you are standing above me. The stream comes first to you and then to me. This is too much.”\nHe was right. The lion becomes very angry and he says, “You don’t know manners – how to talk with elders. The same was so with your father. Yesterday he was talking with me and he misbehaved. I was engaged in some political work, but I am searching for him.”\nThe kid says, “Forgive me, uncle, my father has been dead for a few weeks; he could not have insulted you yesterday.”\nFinding no excuse, the lion still catches the kid and tells him, “You talk against your elders? I will teach you a lesson – and the lesson is a good breakfast.”\nA story about animals but not about animals, it is about man, his inhumanity to those who are weak, powerless, poor. But still, for manners’ sake, you have to find some excuse.\nThese stories have always been interpreted as parables for children, but my feeling is there is something more to it. It indicates that animals may not be thinking, but they still dream – because dreaming does not need anybody to stand erect.\nFor dreaming you also have to lie down, to be in a horizontal position, so the conscious mind cannot function. It needs only a very small quantity of blood; with a greater quantity it goes to sleep. If an even greater quantity comes, it becomes dead. But the unconscious mind goes on working. Of course its language is not alphabetical; its language is of pictures.\nSo a small child lying down on his bed can very easily visualize that the walls are disappearing, the room is disappearing, the bed is disappearing, the trees outside are disappearing. Everything is disappearing and the world is fading... only he is left in his total aloneness in this beautiful dark deep silence.\nBut this is a method prescribed by tantra scriptures that anybody can do – and it will be helpful for meditation.\nIt is an unfortunate thing that parents are unaware of the whole heritage of man. In different directions man has been working to develop consciousness. If all that is available to the parents, perhaps they will not think you are going crazy; they will rejoice, they will help you, they will reward you. They will try to help you so you can go deeper into the experience.\nYou have found, accidentally, a right door. And the child can have from the very beginning a taste of meditation, and he can go on helping it grow every day. By the time he is a young man he will have a mature meditativeness. Then there is no need to lie down on the bed. He can sit or stand, and he can go into the same silence – even with open eyes. It is just a question of going more and more into the same experience so it becomes easy, simple.\nBut all the societies have condemned everything that can help your being to evolve. They don’t want it. If you had told anybody, you would have been condemned as mad: “Stop it; otherwise you are risking your sanity.” And in fact by stopping it you risked your sanity.\nThat’s why I say that every father, every mother, should go through a certain training in which they are taught how to be a father, how to be a mother; where they are made aware that the child is very potent, and that he can manage many things that you cannot, and that this is the time. If you stop him, later on it will become more and more difficult.\nYour experience, Premda, was good, immensely good. And if you try it again, perhaps you may be able to enter the same space without any trouble. We are here together to go into all these experiences; these are different ways of touching your own being.\nThe method is imagination. The walls don’t disappear, and neither do the trees or anything else. That is only a device. But if you can visualize their disappearing, naturally, only you are left, which cannot disappear whatever you do. No imagination is possible to make you disappear; the watcher\nis beyond imagination, beyond mind. What has remained is a watcher, a witness – and that is your pure consciousness.\nSo don’t be worried that what you have used as a strategy was imagination. It doesn’t matter, because you were not interested in walls disappearing; that was just to create a space in which you are freed from everything – whether it is there or not – and you come to the beautiful aloneness of your being. Just a moment of it is an eternity.\nAnd this is a prescribed tantra method, well established for centuries. You cannot go mad. In fact, anything that could have led you into madness has disappeared; now only pure consciousness is there. Pure consciousness has never gone mad.\nSo what happened in childhood was good. It would have been better if you had continued, but you can start again – because anything that has happened once, leaves a certain mark in you; you can start from there again. It may take a little trouble, it may not be so easy, but it will come – in one day, two days, it will come. And if it doesn’t come, then you go to Kaveesha.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nTHE OTHER NIGHT, ALONG WITH A FEW OTHER PEOPLE, I WAS HYPNOTIZED BY KAVEESHA. WHEN SHE BEGAN BY ASKING US TO TAKE DEEP BREATHS – THE ZEN FLUTE PLAYING, THE INCENSE AND THE CANDLE BURNING – I IMMEDIATELY WENT INTO A SPACE WHERE MY CHEST FELT FULL, LIKE TEARS WERE WELLING UP INSIDE. I FELT LIKE I WAS IN A SPACE THAT I ONCE WAS IN BEFORE – A PLACE WHERE I WAS CLOSEST TO MY INNER HOME, A PLACE MY BODY WAS RELAXED IN, WHERE MEDITATION CAME NATURALLY AND THE SURROUNDINGS WERE WARM.\nWHY WAS THERE SADNESS COMING UP WHEN THIS EXPERIENCE WAS HAPPENING?\nWith every experience of this kind you will feel a certain sadness coming to you. The sadness is: “Why does this experience not remain forever?” The sadness simply signifies your deep longing for this state to become stable. And it is a natural phenomenon: whenever you feel something that is of immense beauty and peace, you would like to remain in it forever, to feel there is nothing that can bring you out of it. But one has to come out of it – and that brings sadness.\nBut don’t take that sadness in any negative way. It is a good indicator. It simply shows that you should practice it more – go deeper – and one day it becomes a natural phenomenon. Twenty-four hours a day you are surrounded with a fragrance, with a light, with silence within. Twenty-four hours a day you are relaxed, there is no tension in your body, in your mind. But before it comes, many times you will feel sad – “Why is it not a permanent state of my being?”\nIt is simply a longing that is becoming sadness. The window opens, you see the sunset; and before you have even seen it and the beauty has been absorbed, the window closes. And there is sadness: “The window could have remained open a little more.” But the window opens only according to your capacity. Whatever you have earned, the window remains open only for that long. Beyond that it can be dangerous.\nSo don’t feel bad about sadness; it is a safety too. Even in experiences of oneself, safety measures are needed. But nature has them already prepared for you. You will have a glimpse only for that much time and to that much depth – as much as you deserve – neither less nor more. And it is good, because if you get more you will not be able to absorb it.\nEverybody who is meditating comes to a point when he starts feeling, “Why does meditation not continue the whole day?” But he does not know that he is not capable of handling the world and its affairs with meditation running as an undercurrent. He will be in difficulty. He may be in great danger: the world has no need of meditation. You will have just as much as you deserve, and you should feel thankful for it. It will be growing... with your gratitude it will be growing.\nBut sadness can become a barrier, because each time you come to the window you will have sadness; they will become associated. And the law of association is really a difficult law. Then it will become more and more difficult to get rid of sadness.\nSo simply don’t pay any attention to sadness. If it comes, take it in the natural way. It is natural; you had a beautiful experience, and it has gone. Sadness is simply its going away, a friend departing. But don’t give more importance to it. Ignore it; accepting it as natural, ignore it.\nYou know about Pavlov, one Russian psychologist, who in the beginning of this century proved the law of association – which is his great contribution. In Russia you will not hear the name of Freud, Adler or Jung – only Pavlov. He has developed a totally different psychology – Pavlovian psychology. And because it fits with communism, they have rejected all other psychologies; there is only one psychology, and that is Pavlovian. It is not a complete picture of the human psyche, but this law is certainly true.\nHe used to give his dog... all his experiments were with dogs... he had seventy dogs. Even after the revolution when private property was dissolved, the communist government allowed him to have private property – because how could he manage his seventy dogs and a big lab with strange kinds of instruments? But his psychology was proving in some way that communism should be allowed. He was the only man in the Soviet Union who was allowed to remain exactly the same way as before the revolution.\nHe would feed the dog, and while the dog was eating he would go on ringing a bell. Now, a bell has nothing to do with food; you can ring a bell before any dog and he will not take any interest. He will think that you are a little crackpot: “What are you doing ringing a bell before a dog? What is the point?” He may even turn away just to avoid listening to your ringing bell.\nBut you could not have expected what happened to Pavlov’s dogs. After fifteen days of feeding the dog and at the same time ringing the bell, on the sixteenth day there was no food, just the ringing of the bell – and the dog was ready for food, his tongue hanging out. And this was done with not one dog but seventy dogs. He was a scientist: one dog cannot prove anything, you need to have enough evidence – seventy dogs. As the bell was ringing, their saliva was dripping, their tongues were hanging out. Nobody could believe that with the ringing of a bell this could happen. This he called the law of association.\nWhile he was eating, the dog was also listening to the ringing of the bell. The eating of the food and the listening to the bell became associated in his mind. They became locked, so much so that not\nonly when you rang the bell was the dog ready for food – although there was no food – but he was perfectly ready to eat. And vice versa: when the food was there, he was waiting for the bell to ring and he would not eat.\nThat was a surprise to Pavlov himself. He was thinking that the first thing was okay – that the bell became associated with food. But food is associated with hunger and biologyThe dog would look\nat him as if to say, “What are you doing? Ring the bell!” – because it had become locked. Without the ringing of the bell, the dog would not feel that the food was juicy. It became a kind of music that helped him to taste the food better – and not one dog but seventy dogs were behaving in the same way.\nSo always remember this law. When you are entering inwards, don’t get associated with anything that can become a hindrance.\nFor example, when you feel some beautiful, blissful experience, sadness is bound to come – because that experience will go. But don’t pay too much attention to the sadness, just think that it is natural: “It only shows my longing that the experience should continue.” Otherwise, if you pay too much attention to sadness you are creating an interlock system in your mind, so that whenever you have a beautiful experience, immediately your mind will produce sadness – whether it is now necessary or not.\nEmphasize the positive, be grateful for the positive, rejoice in the positive – and ignore the negative that is bound to follow like a shadow.\nWhen your friend leaves your home, departs, do you pay much attention to his shadow? You don’t even take note of it. In the same way, remember: anything beautiful happening to you will have a shadow to it, until you come to a stage when the twenty-four hours of your day are lit up and there is no shadow possible.\nThat happens – that will happen – but you have to keep these things in your awareness. When sadness comes, thank sadness too: “You are simply my longing for the beautiful experience.” In this way you are cutting the roots of sadness, you are not making it a polar opposite to your experience. You are changing the whole arrangement. You are saying to it, “I know you are my longing for that beautiful experience; but it will come, and it will be coming more and more.”\nIn this way, even through sadness you are emphasizing the beautiful experience, its longing. You are not making sadness a separate entity, in itself important. If it becomes a separate entity, it will become associated; then you can’t have a twenty-four-hour-a-day, waking, sleeping meditativeness, you will have only fragmentsalternating, a beautiful moment and sadness. And as the beautiful\nmoment will become deepened, the sadness will also become deepened; it is its shadow.\nSo on the one hand you will be earning ecstasy; on the other hand you will be suffering again – and the whole fault will be yours. From the very beginning, be careful. Don’t give it any independent existence. Thank it: “You remind me of the beautiful experience; you remind me that the beautiful experience should be continued.” And soon it will happen.\nSo make it secondary, just an epiphenomenon. And as your aloneness will be deepening, the sadness will not be deepening, because you are not giving juice to it; it will remain shallow. And\nsoon a day will come: you will come out of your meditation and you will not find sadness. Now, you have accepted that there are moments of meditation and there are moments of no-meditation; but there is no question of sadness. You have dropped the desire and the longing which were creating the sadness, and you have not paid any attention to it. It has died of its own accord.\nAttention is food.\nWe are not aware of many things which we are living.… In one scientific experiment, two baby monkeys are fed the same food, given the same medical care, the same comforts... everything is the same. Just one thing is different for one baby monkey: the doctor gives him attention – pets him, sits with him, plays with him. And with the second he simply does his duty – no communication, no human warmth, no attention. The monkey that is given attention survives; the monkey that is not given attention dies. The same experiment has been done on other animals; the result is always the same.\nNow it is to be accepted that attention is some kind of nourishment. By giving attention to anything you are pouring your warmth, your love, and you are saying, “There is somebody for whom you have to exist, there is somebody who will miss you.”\nThe other baby monkey, he lives, but there is nobody for whom he lives; there is no meaning in his life. Nobody pays attention to him, nobody communicates with him. It does not matter whether he lives or not. If he dies nobody is going to shed a single tear for him. That idea itself kills him. But it is the idea – “If I die somebody will miss me, somebody will come and sit by my cradle and weep” – that revives the spirit.\nSo, attention is a very psychological nourishment, a psychological vitamin. And the same is true about your emotions, your feelings, anything that you are doing.\nRemember the rule: whatever you want to save, give attention to it, pour your love on it, appreciate it. And whatever you want to disappear from your life, ignore it... at the most thank it: “You remind me of the positive and the beautiful feeling.” That is a sure killer.\nOne of my friends married a woman... he used to love another woman, but he could not marry her. She was of a high-caste Hindu brahmin family, and he was of a low caste. She was rich, he was poor. And in India it is very difficult – an intercaste marriage – because you then become an outcast. You will not get a job, people will not like to talk to you, you will not get a house for rent – a simple boycott. And you cannot live if the society boycotts you completely.\nBut finally he married another woman. I asked him, “What are you doing?”\nHe said, “She looks exactly like the woman I wanted to love.”\nI said, “That’s true. But she is not the woman you loved, she only looks like her. And the moment she discovers it – and she’s bound to discover it as you cannot hide it – it will kill her.”\nHe said, “No, how she can find out? I have confided only in you, and I know you are not going to tell her.”\nI said, “I am not going to tell her. You, yourself, with your behavior, will tell her twenty-four hours a day.”\nAnd within two years the woman was badly sick. I went to see her. She was a young woman just two years before. I could not believe how she had withered away. I asked, “What has happened?”\nShe said, “Nobody can understand, but perhaps you can. He has married me because I look like the girl he loved. But he does not love me; he only pretends. But his pretending cannot satisfy me. I don’t want to be anybody else’s substitute, I want to be myself. My sickness is not of the body, my sickness is of the soul. I will never say it to him because he has suffered much. The first woman he loved, he could not get. And now I should not make more suffering for him. It is better I should die.”\nI said, “This is nonsense – you have your own life.”\nShe said, “I don’t; I am only a substitute. When he hugs me I know whom he is really hugging. He does not give me any warmth. When he loves me I know whom he is really loving, and suddenly I become cold.”\nWithin two months she died, and I told the man, “You are a murderer because you don’t understand a simple fact of life – that people cannot live by bread alone. They need something more: they need attention, they need love.”\nAnd attention and love are very invisible nourishment. But the same is true about your emotions, so never feed any negative emotion. Pour all your love, all your energy, into a positive experience. And the day will not be far away when the experience will start spreading as an undercurrent into the twenty-four hours of your day.\nQuestion 3 BELOVED OSHO,\nI FEEL EMOTIONALLY TOTALLY EXHAUSTED. SOMETHING IS RIPPING ME APART, BUT I CAN’T FIGURE OUT WHAT. IN THE LAST FEW DAYS I’VE BEEN THROUGH INTENSE SPELLS OF HATING MYSELF. IT FEELS LIKE AN ATTACK, AND IT LOOKS IMPOSSIBLE TO LOVE SUCH A CREATURE. ON ANOTHER LEVEL I AM TELLING MYSELF TO WATCH, BE AWARE OF THESE EMOTIONS, TELLING MYSELF THEY ARE NOT REAL. BUT WHEN I AM CAUGHT UP IN THEM, EVERYTHING IS TOTALLY REAL – IT JUST DEPENDS ON WHAT LEVEL HAS THE UPPER HAND AT THE TIME. WHEN I STEP OUTSIDE OF THIS INNER TURMOIL I CAN SEE THIS INSANE PERSON GOING THROUGH HER DAILY ROUTINE, ACTING QUITE NORMALLY.\nIS THIS THE WAY TO GROW, OR AM I JUST PLAINLY CUCKOO, SCHIZOPHRENIC, STUCK IN A CIRCLE?\nEverybody goes through the circle; it is normal. Only one thing you are doing wrong – which will make you take longer to get rid of the misery – and that is: when you feel these negative emotions about yourself, don’t try to watch them. It is not yet the ripe time. Simply live them.\nIt is watching that is giving you the idea of a schizophrenic or split personality – because on the one hand you have these negative feelings about yourself, and on the other hand you are trying to remind yourself that you are just a watcher and these are just images which will fade away. You are cutting yourself in two.\nThe first thing I suggest is: don’t cut yourself in two.\nI would have suggested to you to be watchful, but the time is not ripe, you cannot be. Before you can be totally one with watchfulness, you have to go through the hell of all your negative emotions; otherwise they will be repressed and they will erupt at any moment, at any weak time.\nSo it is better to get rid of them. But getting rid of them does not mean you have to be watchful. First, forget about watchfulness. Live each emotion that you feel; it is you. Hateful, ugly, unworthy – whatever it is, you be actually in it. First give them a chance to come up totally into the conscious. Right now, by your effort of watchfulness you are repressing them into the unconscious. And then you get involved in your day-to-day work and you force them back again. That is not the way to get rid of them.\nLet them come out – live them, suffer them. It will be difficult and tedious but immensely rewarding. Once you have lived them, suffered them, accepted them, that this is you, that you have not made yourself in this way so you need not condemn yourself, that this is the way you have found yourself – once they are lived consciously, without any repression, you will be surprised that they are disappearing on their own. Their force on you is becoming less, their grip on your neck is no longer that tight. And when they are going away, there may be a time when you can start watching.\nIn the East they have a parable: an elephant passes through a door... the elephant has passed, but his shadow is still inside the door and it looks almost like the elephant. This is the time when the elephant has passed and only the shadow has remained. That you can watch – because shadows cannot go into the unconscious; shadows don’t have any existence. If you are watchful, aware, the shadow will die, disappear. But first let the elephant go.\nYou are keeping the elephant in. You can hide the elephant inside, but for how long? And you will be carrying the elephant and its weight all the time. In each of your actions it will have some influence. You will do things but there will be anger, you will do things but there will be hatred, you will do things but almost like a zombie – because that elephant is too heavy.\nAnd you are not responsible for it. In fact, nobody is responsible for it. God used to be responsible, but he is dead; that was his only function. You can call the society responsible, you can call the parents responsible, but that does not help. That may give you a kind of solace, but it is not a solution. Remember, nobody is responsible; this is the way you have found yourself.\nAnd I don’t see that there is anything abnormal in it; everybody passes through it more or less. One thing has to be remembered: the bigger the elephant you are carrying within you, the bigger will be the release and freedom. So everything is balance. Your suffering may be great, but your blessing will also be great. So don’t be bothered by it. What is wrong in it?\nJust live it.\nFor you, for the time being, the only way is to live it totally, so that the elephant can come out unafraid: “Now I am ready to live; there is no problem to hide.” And once everything comes into the conscious mind it disperses, and when only the shadow is there, that is the time to become aware. Right now it will create schizophrenia; then it will create enlightenment.\nAnd never be worried about big problems. All our problems are small. We are small – how can there be big problems? Secondly, whatever the depth of the problem will be the depth of your freedom, of your benediction when the problem disappears. So you will be perfectly balanced.\nBut remember not to repress. Your idea of being watchful right now is nothing but repression.\nI will tell you one day – you will ask me one day – “Now it is the time to start being awake.” Just a little patience... and we all can afford it.\nQuestion 4 BELOVED OSHO,\nWHY DO I ALWAYS FEEL LIKE YOU ARE PULLING MY BIG TOE WHEN YOU ANSWER MY QUESTIONS?\nMilarepa, I am pulling everybody’s toe, but nobody is crazy enough to confess it. Everybody knows it... because do you think I come here to speak? I come here to pull your big toe. And everybody knows – but nobody tells it to anybody else!\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"5148","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_transmission_of_the_lamp/part6/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_transmission_of_the_lamp/>The Transmission of the Lamp</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">6 Pure consciousness has never gone mad</h1><div class=post-meta>25 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;5148 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Transmission_of_the_Lamp/part6.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part5>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

LYING IN MY BED IN THE DARK, STRANGE EXPERIENCES WHICH I LOVED VERY
MUCH. IT STARTED BY MY IMAGINING THAT MY BED DISAPPEARED, THEN MY ROOM,
THE HOUSE, THE TOWN, ALL PEOPLE, THE COUNTRY, THE WHOLE GLOBE...
EVERYTHING IN THE UNIVERSE FADED. THERE WAS UTTER DARKNESS AND SILENCE;
I WAS JUST FLOATING IN SPACE.</p><p><br></p><p>THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE LAST MATERIAL THINGS CREATED A TREMENDOUS
WHIRLING AROUND ME. I WAS SUCKED INTO IT; THIS FEELING WAS ALMOST
SEXUAL. IT CREATED A SWEET, PULLING SENSATION IN MY BELLY, WHICH COULD
LAST FOR SECONDS OR SOMETIMES FOR ONE TO TWO MINUTES.</p><p><br></p><p>I NEVER TALKED TO MY PARENTS OR ANYBODY ELSE ABOUT IT, BECAUSE I
FEARED THEY MIGHT THINK ME MAD.</p><p><br></p><p>OSHO, WHAT WAS THIS EXPERIENCE?</p><p><br></p><p>There is a tantra method in which one does exactly the same exercise
as you are describing from your childhood. For children it is easy, but
for grown-ups also, it is not impossible. It is simply an exercise of
the imagination. But that does not mean that what you experience is
unreal.</p><p>First, let me tell you about a tantra method. It is for all ages. It
has to be done in the dark, because in the dark you cannot see things,
so it is easy to imagine that they have disappeared.</p><p><br></p><p>Lying down is the most appropriate posture for it. Because man became
man, attained a little bit of consciousness by standing up on his two
feet – he became vertical – the blood stream now reaches less to his
head than when he is lying horizontal. Lying down, the blood reaches in
a greater quantity with more speed just because of gravitation. When you
stand up, the blood has to go against gravitation; its flow is slowed
down, its quantity is cut.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why no other animal has a conscious mind. Even when walking, a
cow, a horse, a buffalo – they are horizontal. Their heads are receiving
as much blood as any other part of the body. They cannot grow the very
subtle, very small cells which enable man to think.</p><p><br></p><p>But there is a possibility – and as far as I am concerned it is a
certainty – that animals do imagine. They don’t have a conscious mind,
but they do have an unconscious mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Watching a dog you can see it. A dog is sleeping nearby; you can just
watch: once in a while he will try to catch an imaginary fly, a fly
which is not there. What is he doing? He imagined it. That catching of
the fly which is not there must have been to him a reality in his
imagination. And, of course, dogs think of flies just as men think of
women.</p><p><br></p><p>Nobody has tried to explore the unconscious of the animals. We are
not even finished with man, so the question of animals does not arise.
They are far back in the queue, standing and waiting. But the wisdom of
people has always attributed a certain intelligence to animals.</p><p><br></p><p>Aesop’s fables are fables about man, but all the actors are animals.
panch tantra, the ancientmost book of stories, has fables which talk
about man because they are written by man, but the actors,
participants... everybody is an animal. And in every country there are
ancient books in which animals are taking part, just like man. For
example, in one of Aesop’s fables, a little goat – a kid – is drinking
water from a mountain stream, and the king of the animals, the lion,
comes by. It is breakfast time, and the kid is just a perfect breakfast.
But even animals have to find excuses first, so the lion says to the
goat, “Kid, you are very arrogant; you see the emperor of the whole
animal kingdom, and yet you are muddying the water which I am going to
drink.”</p><p><br></p><p>The poor kid says, “Uncle, the stream is going this way. I cannot
make the water muddy for you; you are standing above me. The stream
comes first to you and then to me. This is too much.”</p><p><br></p><p>He was right. The lion becomes very angry and he says, “You don’t
know manners – how to talk with elders. The same was so with your
father. Yesterday he was talking with me and he misbehaved. I was
engaged in some political work, but I am searching for him.”</p><p><br></p><p>The kid says, “Forgive me, uncle, my father has been dead for a few
weeks; he could not have insulted you yesterday.”</p><p><br></p><p>Finding no excuse, the lion still catches the kid and tells him, “You
talk against your elders? I will teach you a lesson – and the lesson is
a good breakfast.”</p><p>A story about animals but not about animals, it is about man, his
inhumanity to those who are weak, powerless, poor. But still, for
manners’ sake, you have to find some excuse.</p><p><br></p><p>These stories have always been interpreted as parables for children,
but my feeling is there is something more to it. It indicates that
animals may not be thinking, but they still dream – because dreaming
does not need anybody to stand erect.</p><p><br></p><p>For dreaming you also have to lie down, to be in a horizontal
position, so the conscious mind cannot function. It needs only a very
small quantity of blood; with a greater quantity it goes to sleep. If an
even greater quantity comes, it becomes dead. But the unconscious mind
goes on working. Of course its language is not alphabetical; its
language is of pictures.</p><p><br></p><p>So a small child lying down on his bed can very easily visualize that
the walls are disappearing, the room is disappearing, the bed is
disappearing, the trees outside are disappearing. Everything is
disappearing and the world is fading... only he is left in his total
aloneness in this beautiful dark deep silence.</p><p><br></p><p>But this is a method prescribed by tantra scriptures that anybody can
do – and it will be helpful for meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>It is an unfortunate thing that parents are unaware of the whole
heritage of man. In different directions man has been working to develop
consciousness. If all that is available to the parents, perhaps they
will not think you are going crazy; they will rejoice, they will help
you, they will reward you. They will try to help you so you can go
deeper into the experience.</p><p><br></p><p>You have found, accidentally, a right door. And the child can have
from the very beginning a taste of meditation, and he can go on helping
it grow every day. By the time he is a young man he will have a mature
meditativeness. Then there is no need to lie down on the bed. He can sit
or stand, and he can go into the same silence – even with open eyes. It
is just a question of going more and more into the same experience so it
becomes easy, simple.</p><p><br></p><p>But all the societies have condemned everything that can help your
being to evolve. They don’t want it. If you had told anybody, you would
have been condemned as mad: “Stop it; otherwise you are risking your
sanity.” And in fact by stopping it you risked your sanity.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why I say that every father, every mother, should go through a
certain training in which they are taught how to be a father, how to be
a mother; where they are made aware that the child is very potent, and
that he can manage many things that you cannot, and that this is the
time. If you stop him, later on it will become more and more
difficult.</p><p><br></p><p>Your experience, Premda, was good, immensely good. And if you try it
again, perhaps you may be able to enter the same space without any
trouble. We are here together to go into all these experiences; these
are different ways of touching your own being.</p><p><br></p><p>The method is imagination. The walls don’t disappear, and neither do
the trees or anything else. That is only a device. But if you can
visualize their disappearing, naturally, only you are left, which cannot
disappear whatever you do. No imagination is possible to make you
disappear; the watcher</p><p>is beyond imagination, beyond mind. What has remained is a watcher, a
witness – and that is your pure consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>So don’t be worried that what you have used as a strategy was
imagination. It doesn’t matter, because you were not interested in walls
disappearing; that was just to create a space in which you are freed
from everything – whether it is there or not – and you come to the
beautiful aloneness of your being. Just a moment of it is an
eternity.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is a prescribed tantra method, well established for
centuries. You cannot go mad. In fact, anything that could have led you
into madness has disappeared; now only pure consciousness is there. Pure
consciousness has never gone mad.</p><p><br></p><p>So what happened in childhood was good. It would have been better if
you had continued, but you can start again – because anything that has
happened once, leaves a certain mark in you; you can start from there
again. It may take a little trouble, it may not be so easy, but it will
come – in one day, two days, it will come. And if it doesn’t come, then
you go to Kaveesha.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>THE OTHER NIGHT, ALONG WITH A FEW OTHER PEOPLE, I WAS HYPNOTIZED BY
KAVEESHA. WHEN SHE BEGAN BY ASKING US TO TAKE DEEP BREATHS – THE ZEN
FLUTE PLAYING, THE INCENSE AND THE CANDLE BURNING – I IMMEDIATELY WENT
INTO A SPACE WHERE MY CHEST FELT FULL, LIKE TEARS WERE WELLING UP
INSIDE. I FELT LIKE I WAS IN A SPACE THAT I ONCE WAS IN BEFORE – A PLACE
WHERE I WAS CLOSEST TO MY INNER HOME, A PLACE MY BODY WAS RELAXED IN,
WHERE MEDITATION CAME NATURALLY AND THE SURROUNDINGS WERE WARM.</p><p><br></p><p>WHY WAS THERE SADNESS COMING UP WHEN THIS EXPERIENCE WAS
HAPPENING?</p><p><br></p><p>With every experience of this kind you will feel a certain sadness
coming to you. The sadness is: “Why does this experience not remain
forever?” The sadness simply signifies your deep longing for this state
to become stable. And it is a natural phenomenon: whenever you feel
something that is of immense beauty and peace, you would like to remain
in it forever, to feel there is nothing that can bring you out of it.
But one has to come out of it – and that brings sadness.</p><p><br></p><p>But don’t take that sadness in any negative way. It is a good
indicator. It simply shows that you should practice it more – go deeper
– and one day it becomes a natural phenomenon. Twenty-four hours a day
you are surrounded with a fragrance, with a light, with silence within.
Twenty-four hours a day you are relaxed, there is no tension in your
body, in your mind. But before it comes, many times you will feel sad –
“Why is it not a permanent state of my being?”</p><p><br></p><p>It is simply a longing that is becoming sadness. The window opens,
you see the sunset; and before you have even seen it and the beauty has
been absorbed, the window closes. And there is sadness: “The window
could have remained open a little more.” But the window opens only
according to your capacity. Whatever you have earned, the window remains
open only for that long. Beyond that it can be dangerous.</p><p>So don’t feel bad about sadness; it is a safety too. Even in
experiences of oneself, safety measures are needed. But nature has them
already prepared for you. You will have a glimpse only for that much
time and to that much depth – as much as you deserve – neither less nor
more. And it is good, because if you get more you will not be able to
absorb it.</p><p><br></p><p>Everybody who is meditating comes to a point when he starts feeling,
“Why does meditation not continue the whole day?” But he does not know
that he is not capable of handling the world and its affairs with
meditation running as an undercurrent. He will be in difficulty. He may
be in great danger: the world has no need of meditation. You will have
just as much as you deserve, and you should feel thankful for it. It
will be growing... with your gratitude it will be growing.</p><p><br></p><p>But sadness can become a barrier, because each time you come to the
window you will have sadness; they will become associated. And the law
of association is really a difficult law. Then it will become more and
more difficult to get rid of sadness.</p><p><br></p><p>So simply don’t pay any attention to sadness. If it comes, take it in
the natural way. It is natural; you had a beautiful experience, and it
has gone. Sadness is simply its going away, a friend departing. But
don’t give more importance to it. Ignore it; accepting it as natural,
ignore it.</p><p><br></p><p>You know about Pavlov, one Russian psychologist, who in the beginning
of this century proved the law of association – which is his great
contribution. In Russia you will not hear the name of Freud, Adler or
Jung – only Pavlov. He has developed a totally different psychology –
Pavlovian psychology. And because it fits with communism, they have
rejected all other psychologies; there is only one psychology, and that
is Pavlovian. It is not a complete picture of the human psyche, but this
law is certainly true.</p><p><br></p><p>He used to give his dog... all his experiments were with dogs... he
had seventy dogs. Even after the revolution when private property was
dissolved, the communist government allowed him to have private property
– because how could he manage his seventy dogs and a big lab with
strange kinds of instruments? But his psychology was proving in some way
that communism should be allowed. He was the only man in the Soviet
Union who was allowed to remain exactly the same way as before the
revolution.</p><p><br></p><p>He would feed the dog, and while the dog was eating he would go on
ringing a bell. Now, a bell has nothing to do with food; you can ring a
bell before any dog and he will not take any interest. He will think
that you are a little crackpot: “What are you doing ringing a bell
before a dog? What is the point?” He may even turn away just to avoid
listening to your ringing bell.</p><p><br></p><p>But you could not have expected what happened to Pavlov’s dogs. After
fifteen days of feeding the dog and at the same time ringing the bell,
on the sixteenth day there was no food, just the ringing of the bell –
and the dog was ready for food, his tongue hanging out. And this was
done with not one dog but seventy dogs. He was a scientist: one dog
cannot prove anything, you need to have enough evidence – seventy dogs.
As the bell was ringing, their saliva was dripping, their tongues were
hanging out. Nobody could believe that with the ringing of a bell this
could happen. This he called the law of association.</p><p><br></p><p>While he was eating, the dog was also listening to the ringing of the
bell. The eating of the food and the listening to the bell became
associated in his mind. They became locked, so much so that not</p><p>only when you rang the bell was the dog ready for food – although
there was no food – but he was perfectly ready to eat. And vice versa:
when the food was there, he was waiting for the bell to ring and he
would not eat.</p><p><br></p><p>That was a surprise to Pavlov himself. He was thinking that the first
thing was okay – that the bell became associated with food. But food is
associated with hunger and biology<span class=s4></span>The dog would
look</p><p>at him as if to say, “What are you doing? Ring the bell!” – because
it had become locked. Without the ringing of the bell, the dog would not
feel that the food was juicy. It became a kind of music that helped him
to taste the food better – and not one dog but seventy dogs were
behaving in the same way.</p><p><br></p><p>So always remember this law. When you are entering inwards, don’t get
associated with anything that can become a hindrance.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, when you feel some beautiful, blissful experience,
sadness is bound to come – because that experience will go. But don’t
pay too much attention to the sadness, just think that it is natural:
“It only shows my longing that the experience should continue.”
Otherwise, if you pay too much attention to sadness you are creating an
interlock system in your mind, so that whenever you have a beautiful
experience, immediately your mind will produce sadness – whether it is
now necessary or not.</p><p><br></p><p>Emphasize the positive, be grateful for the positive, rejoice in the
positive – and ignore the negative that is bound to follow like a
shadow.</p><p><br></p><p>When your friend leaves your home, departs, do you pay much attention
to his shadow? You don’t even take note of it. In the same way,
remember: anything beautiful happening to you will have a shadow to it,
until you come to a stage when the twenty-four hours of your day are lit
up and there is no shadow possible.</p><p><br></p><p>That happens – that will happen – but you have to keep these things
in your awareness. When sadness comes, thank sadness too: “You are
simply my longing for the beautiful experience.” In this way you are
cutting the roots of sadness, you are not making it a polar opposite to
your experience. You are changing the whole arrangement. You are saying
to it, “I know you are my longing for that beautiful experience; but it
will come, and it will be coming more and more.”</p><p><br></p><p>In this way, even through sadness you are emphasizing the beautiful
experience, its longing. You are not making sadness a separate entity,
in itself important. If it becomes a separate entity, it will become
associated; then you can’t have a twenty-four-hour-a-day, waking,
sleeping meditativeness, you will have only fragments<span class=s4></span>alternating, a beautiful moment and sadness. And as
the beautiful</p><p>moment will become deepened, the sadness will also become deepened;
it is its shadow.</p><p><br></p><p>So on the one hand you will be earning ecstasy; on the other hand you
will be suffering again – and the whole fault will be yours. From the
very beginning, be careful. Don’t give it any independent existence.
Thank it: “You remind me of the beautiful experience; you remind me that
the beautiful experience should be continued.” And soon it will
happen.</p><p><br></p><p>So make it secondary, just an epiphenomenon. And as your aloneness
will be deepening, the sadness will not be deepening, because you are
not giving juice to it; it will remain shallow. And</p><p>soon a day will come: you will come out of your meditation and you
will not find sadness. Now, you have accepted that there are moments of
meditation and there are moments of no-meditation; but there is no
question of sadness. You have dropped the desire and the longing which
were creating the sadness, and you have not paid any attention to it. It
has died of its own accord.</p><p><br></p><p>Attention is food.</p><p><br></p><p>We are not aware of many things which we are living.… In one
scientific experiment, two baby monkeys are fed the same food, given the
same medical care, the same comforts... everything is the same. Just one
thing is different for one baby monkey: the doctor gives him attention –
pets him, sits with him, plays with him. And with the second he simply
does his duty – no communication, no human warmth, no attention. The
monkey that is given attention survives; the monkey that is not given
attention dies. The same experiment has been done on other animals; the
result is always the same.</p><p><br></p><p>Now it is to be accepted that attention is some kind of nourishment.
By giving attention to anything you are pouring your warmth, your love,
and you are saying, “There is somebody for whom you have to exist, there
is somebody who will miss you.”</p><p><br></p><p>The other baby monkey, he lives, but there is nobody for whom he
lives; there is no meaning in his life. Nobody pays attention to him,
nobody communicates with him. It does not matter whether he lives or
not. If he dies nobody is going to shed a single tear for him. That idea
itself kills him. But it is the idea – “If I die somebody will miss me,
somebody will come and sit by my cradle and weep” – that revives the
spirit.</p><p><br></p><p>So, attention is a very psychological nourishment, a psychological
vitamin. And the same is true about your emotions, your feelings,
anything that you are doing.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember the rule: whatever you want to save, give attention to it,
pour your love on it, appreciate it. And whatever you want to disappear
from your life, ignore it... at the most thank it: “You remind me of the
positive and the beautiful feeling.” That is a sure killer.</p><p><br></p><p>One of my friends married a woman... he used to love another woman,
but he could not marry her. She was of a high-caste Hindu brahmin
family, and he was of a low caste. She was rich, he was poor. And in
India it is very difficult – an intercaste marriage – because you then
become an outcast. You will not get a job, people will not like to talk
to you, you will not get a house for rent – a simple boycott. And you
cannot live if the society boycotts you completely.</p><p><br></p><p>But finally he married another woman. I asked him, “What are you
doing?”</p><p>He said, “She looks exactly like the woman I wanted to love.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “That’s true. But she is not the woman you loved, she only
looks like her. And the moment she discovers it – and she’s bound to
discover it as you cannot hide it – it will kill her.”</p><p>He said, “No, how she can find out? I have confided only in you, and
I know you are not going to tell her.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I am not going to tell her. You, yourself, with your
behavior, will tell her twenty-four hours a day.”</p><p><br></p><p>And within two years the woman was badly sick. I went to see her. She
was a young woman just two years before. I could not believe how she had
withered away. I asked, “What has happened?”</p><p><br></p><p>She said, “Nobody can understand, but perhaps you can. He has married
me because I look like the girl he loved. But he does not love me; he
only pretends. But his pretending cannot satisfy me. I don’t want to be
anybody else’s substitute, I want to be myself. My sickness is not of
the body, my sickness is of the soul. I will never say it to him because
he has suffered much. The first woman he loved, he could not get. And
now I should not make more suffering for him. It is better I should
die.”</p><p>I said, “This is nonsense – you have your own life.”</p><p><br></p><p>She said, “I don’t; I am only a substitute. When he hugs me I know
whom he is really hugging. He does not give me any warmth. When he loves
me I know whom he is really loving, and suddenly I become cold.”</p><p><br></p><p>Within two months she died, and I told the man, “You are a murderer
because you don’t understand a simple fact of life – that people cannot
live by bread alone. They need something more: they need attention, they
need love.”</p><p><br></p><p>And attention and love are very invisible nourishment. But the same
is true about your emotions, so never feed any negative emotion. Pour
all your love, all your energy, into a positive experience. And the day
will not be far away when the experience will start spreading as an
undercurrent into the twenty-four hours of your day.</p><p>Question 3 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>I FEEL EMOTIONALLY TOTALLY EXHAUSTED. SOMETHING IS RIPPING ME APART,
BUT I CAN’T FIGURE OUT WHAT. IN THE LAST FEW DAYS I’VE BEEN THROUGH
INTENSE SPELLS OF HATING MYSELF. IT FEELS LIKE AN ATTACK, AND IT LOOKS
IMPOSSIBLE TO LOVE SUCH A CREATURE. ON ANOTHER LEVEL I AM TELLING MYSELF
TO WATCH, BE AWARE OF THESE EMOTIONS, TELLING MYSELF THEY ARE NOT REAL.
BUT WHEN I AM CAUGHT UP IN THEM, EVERYTHING IS TOTALLY REAL – IT JUST
DEPENDS ON WHAT LEVEL HAS THE UPPER HAND AT THE TIME. WHEN I STEP
OUTSIDE OF THIS INNER TURMOIL I CAN SEE THIS INSANE PERSON GOING THROUGH
HER DAILY ROUTINE, ACTING QUITE NORMALLY.</p><p>IS THIS THE WAY TO GROW, OR AM I JUST PLAINLY CUCKOO, SCHIZOPHRENIC,
STUCK IN A CIRCLE?</p><p><br></p><p>Everybody goes through the circle; it is normal. Only one thing you
are doing wrong – which will make you take longer to get rid of the
misery – and that is: when you feel these negative emotions about
yourself, don’t try to watch them. It is not yet the ripe time. Simply
live them.</p><p>It is watching that is giving you the idea of a schizophrenic or
split personality – because on the one hand you have these negative
feelings about yourself, and on the other hand you are trying to remind
yourself that you are just a watcher and these are just images which
will fade away. You are cutting yourself in two.</p><p><br></p><p>The first thing I suggest is: don’t cut yourself in two.</p><p><br></p><p>I would have suggested to you to be watchful, but the time is not
ripe, you cannot be. Before you can be totally one with watchfulness,
you have to go through the hell of all your negative emotions; otherwise
they will be repressed and they will erupt at any moment, at any weak
time.</p><p><br></p><p>So it is better to get rid of them. But getting rid of them does not
mean you have to be watchful. First, forget about watchfulness. Live
each emotion that you feel; it is you. Hateful, ugly, unworthy –
whatever it is, you be actually in it. First give them a chance to come
up totally into the conscious. Right now, by your effort of watchfulness
you are repressing them into the unconscious. And then you get involved
in your day-to-day work and you force them back again. That is not the
way to get rid of them.</p><p><br></p><p>Let them come out – live them, suffer them. It will be difficult and
tedious but immensely rewarding. Once you have lived them, suffered
them, accepted them, that this is you, that you have not made yourself
in this way so you need not condemn yourself, that this is the way you
have found yourself – once they are lived consciously, without any
repression, you will be surprised that they are disappearing on their
own. Their force on you is becoming less, their grip on your neck is no
longer that tight. And when they are going away, there may be a time
when you can start watching.</p><p><br></p><p>In the East they have a parable: an elephant passes through a door...
the elephant has passed, but his shadow is still inside the door and it
looks almost like the elephant. This is the time when the elephant has
passed and only the shadow has remained. That you can watch – because
shadows cannot go into the unconscious; shadows don’t have any
existence. If you are watchful, aware, the shadow will die, disappear.
But first let the elephant go.</p><p><br></p><p>You are keeping the elephant in. You can hide the elephant inside,
but for how long? And you will be carrying the elephant and its weight
all the time. In each of your actions it will have some influence. You
will do things but there will be anger, you will do things but there
will be hatred, you will do things but almost like a zombie – because
that elephant is too heavy.</p><p><br></p><p>And you are not responsible for it. In fact, nobody is responsible
for it. God used to be responsible, but he is dead; that was his only
function. You can call the society responsible, you can call the parents
responsible, but that does not help. That may give you a kind of solace,
but it is not a solution. Remember, nobody is responsible; this is the
way you have found yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>And I don’t see that there is anything abnormal in it; everybody
passes through it more or less. One thing has to be remembered: the
bigger the elephant you are carrying within you, the bigger will be the
release and freedom. So everything is balance. Your suffering may be
great, but your blessing will also be great. So don’t be bothered by it.
What is wrong in it?</p><p><br></p><p>Just live it.</p><p>For you, for the time being, the only way is to live it totally, so
that the elephant can come out unafraid: “Now I am ready to live; there
is no problem to hide.” And once everything comes into the conscious
mind it disperses, and when only the shadow is there, that is the time
to become aware. Right now it will create schizophrenia; then it will
create enlightenment.</p><p><br></p><p>And never be worried about big problems. All our problems are small.
We are small – how can there be big problems? Secondly, whatever the
depth of the problem will be the depth of your freedom, of your
benediction when the problem disappears. So you will be perfectly
balanced.</p><p><br></p><p>But remember not to repress. Your idea of being watchful right now is
nothing but repression.</p><p><br></p><p>I will tell you one day – you will ask me one day – “Now it is the
time to start being awake.” Just a little patience... and we all can
afford it.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 4 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>WHY DO I ALWAYS FEEL LIKE YOU ARE PULLING MY BIG TOE WHEN YOU ANSWER
MY QUESTIONS?</p><p><br></p><p>Milarepa, I am pulling everybody’s toe, but nobody is crazy enough to
confess it. Everybody knows it... because do you think I come here to
speak? I come here to pull your big toe. And everybody knows – but
nobody tells it to anybody else!</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part5>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

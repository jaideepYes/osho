BUT SO MUCH OF VALUE IS CONTAINED IN YOUR BOOKS WHICH IS BEING MADE AVAILABLE TO CONTEMPORARY PEOPLE, AND WHICH COULD BE PART OF A RECORD OF A WHOLE DIFFERENT DIMENSION FROM THAT WHICH IS CONVENTIONALLY REGARDED AS HISTORY.\nA NEW RECORD COULD BE COMPILED OF THE REAL HISTORY: THE EVOLUTION OF MAN’S CONSCIOUSNESS BEGINNING WITH PRIMEVAL MAN AND THE FIRST HINTS OF MAN’S AWARENESS OF HIMSELF, TAKING IN ALL THOSE WHO HAVE BECOME AWAKENED, ALL MYSTICAL SCRIPTURES AND DOCUMENTS, AND CULMINATING IN YOU AND YOUR WORK.\nOF ALL THE MASTERS, YOU HAVE THE MOST ECLECTIC AND COMPREHENSIVE RECORD OF YOUR OWN EVOLUTION IN CONSCIOUSNESS – FROM THOSE DAYS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING YOUR ENLIGHTENMENT, YOUR DAYS OF TRAVELLING AROUND INDIA, TO BOMBAY, POONA, OREGON, AND NOW, THE WORLD TOUR.\nIN ADDITION, THE QUESTIONS YOU PROVOKE IN US, YOUR DISCIPLES, OUTLINE THE PROCESS OF OUR GROWING CONSCIOUSNESS, AND ARE, IN THEMSELVES, ANOTHER UNIQUE ASPECT OF YOUR WORK.\nOSHO, WE HAVE ALREADY FORGIVEN YOU FOR NOT ALLOWING US TO FORGET YOU. WE, YOUR EDITORS, JUST WANT TO ENSURE THAT YOUR WORDS AND THE FRAGRANCE THAT YOU ARE HAUNT PEOPLE FOR GENERATIONS TO COME AND DRIVE THEM TOTALLY SANE!\nThat is your problem.\nNext question.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nTHERE IS A STORY OF A DISCIPLE WHO COMES TO SEE HIS MASTER AND ASKS HIM WHETHER MAN IS FREE.\nTHE MASTER TELLS HIS DISCIPLE TO STAND UP AND TO LIFT ONE OF HIS FEET OFF THE GROUND. THE DISCIPLE, STANDING ON ONE LEG – AND THE OTHER ONE IN THE AIR – UNDERSTANDS LESS THAN BEFORE.\nNOW THE MASTER ASKS HIM TO ALSO LIFT THE OTHER FOOT OFF THE GROUND.\nOSHO, CAN YOU SPEAK ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FREEDOM FOR AND FREEDOM FROM?\nFreedom from is ordinary, mundane. Man has always tried to be free from things. It is not creative. It is the negative aspect of freedom.\nFreedom for is creativity. You have a certain vision that you would like to materialize and you want freedom for it.\nFreedom from is always from the past, and freedom for is always for the future.\nFreedom for is a spiritual dimension because you are moving into the unknown and perhaps, one day, into the unknowable. It will give you wings.\nFreedom from, at the most, can take away your handcuffs. It is not necessarily beneficial – and the whole of history is a proof of it. People have never thought of the second freedom that I am insisting on; they have only thought of the first – because they don’t have the insight to see the second. The first is visible: chains on their feet, handcuffs on their hands. They want to be free from them, but then what? What are you going to do with your hands? You may even repent that you asked for freedom from.\nIt happened in the castle of the Bastille – I have told you – in the French Revolution it was the most famous French prison, it was reserved only for those who were sentenced to live in jail for their whole lives. So one entered the Bastille alive but never came out alive – only the dead bodies came out.\nAnd when they put on the handcuffs, the chains, they locked them and threw the keys in a well which was inside the Bastille – because they were not needed. Those locks would not be opened again so what would be their use?\nThere were more than five thousand people. What is the use of keeping five thousand peoples’ keys and maintaining them unnecessarily?\nOnce they have entered their dark cells, they have entered them forever.\nThe French revolutionaries necessarily thought that the first thing that had to be done was to free the people from the Bastille.\nIt is inhuman to put somebody for any act whatsoever into prison in a dark cell just to wait for his death which might come fifty years afterwards, sixty years afterwards. Sixty years of waiting is an immense torture to the soul. It is not punishment, it is vengeance, revenge, because these people disobeyed the law. There is no balance between their acts and the punishment.\nThe revolutionaries opened the doors, they dragged people out from their dark cells. And they were surprised. Those people were not ready to get out of their cells.\nYou can understand. A person who has lived for sixty years in darkness – the sun is too much for him. He does not want to come out into the light. His eyes have become too delicate. And what is the point? He is now eighty. When he entered he was twenty. His whole life has been in this darkness. This darkness has become his home.\nAnd they wanted to make them free. They broke their chains, their handcuffs – because there were no keys. But the prisoners were very resistant. They did not want to go out of the prison. They said, “You don’t understand our condition. A man who has been sixty years in this position, what will he do outside? Who will provide him food? Here food is given, and he can rest in his peaceful, dark cell. He knows he is almost dead. Outside he will not be able to find his wife – what has happened to her, his parents will have died, his friends will have died or may have completely forgotten him.\n“And nobody is going to give him a job. A man who has been for sixty years out of work, who is going to give him a job? – and a man from the Bastille, where the most dangerous criminals were kept? Just the name of Bastille will be enough to have him refused from any job. Why are you forcing us? Where will we sleep? We don’t have any houses. We have almost forgotten where we used to live – somebody else must be living there. Our houses, our families, our friends, our whole world has changed so much in sixty years; we will not be able to make it. Don’t torture us more. We have been tortured enough.”\nAnd in what they were saying there was reasonableness.\nBut revolutionaries are stubborn people; they won’t listen. They forced them out of the Bastille, but by that night almost everybody had come back. They said, “Give us food because we are hungry.”\nA few came in the middle of the night and they said, “Give us our chains back because we cannot sleep without them. We have slept for fifty, sixty years with handcuffs, with chains on our legs, in darkness. They have become almost part of our bodies, we cannot sleep without them. You return our chains – and we want our cells. We were perfectly happy. Don’t force your revolution on us. We are poor people. You can do your revolution somewhere else.”\nThe revolutionaries were shocked.\nBut the incident shows that freedom from is not necessarily a blessing.\nYou can see all over the world; countries have become free from the British Empire, from the Spanish Empire, from the Portuguese Empire – but their situation is far worse than it was when they were slaves. At least in their slavery they had become accustomed to it, they had dropped ambitions, they had accepted their situation as their destiny.\nFreedom from slavery simply creates chaos.\nMy whole family was involved in India’s freedom struggle. They had all been to jail. Their education was disturbed. Nobody could pass the university because before they could pass the examination they were caught – somebody was three years in jail, somebody was four years in jail. And then it was too late to start again, and they had become bona fide revolutionaries. In jail they contacted all the leaders of revolution; then their whole lives were devoted to revolution.\nI was small but I used to argue with my father, with my uncles: “I can understand that slavery is ugly, it dehumanizes you, humiliates you, it degrades you from the prestige of being a human being; it should be fought against. But my point is, what will you do when you are free? Freedom from is clear, and I am not against it. What I want to know and understand clearly is what you are going to do with your freedom.\n“You know how to live in slavery. Do you know how to live in freedom? You know a certain order has to be maintained in slavery; otherwise you will be crushed, killed, shot. Do you know that in freedom it will be your responsibility to maintain the order? Nobody will be killing you and nobody else will be responsible for it – you have to be responsible for it. Have you asked your leaders what this freedom is for?”\nAnd I never received any answer. They said, “Right now we are so involved in getting rid of slavery; we will take care of freedom later on.”\nI said, “This is not a scientific attitude. If you are demolishing the old house, if you are intelligent you should at least prepare a map for the new house. The best would be that you prepare the new house before you demolish the old. Otherwise you will be without a house and then you will suffer – because it is better to be in the old house than to be without a house.”\nIn my family, great leaders of the Indian revolution used to stay with us – and this was my constant argument with them. And I have never found a single leader of the Indian revolution who had the answer to what they were going to do with freedom.\nFreedom came. Hindus and Mohammedans killed each other in millions. They had been kept from killing each other by the British forces; the forces were removed – and there were riots all over India. Everybody’s life was in danger. Whole towns were burning; whole trains were burning, and people were not allowed to get out of the trains.\nI said, “This is strange. It was not happening in slavery, and it is happening in freedom – and the reason simply is that you were not prepared for what freedom is.”\nThe country was divided into two parts – they had never thought about it. In the whole country there was chaos. And the people who came to power had a certain expertise and that expertise was in burning the bridges, in burning the jails, in killing the people who were enslaving the country. This expertise has nothing to do with building up a new country. But these were the leaders in the revolution; naturally they came to power. They had fought, they had won, and the power came into their hands. And it was in the wrong hands.\nNo revolutionary should be given the power – because he knows how to sabotage, but he does not know how to create; he only knows how to destroy. He should be honored, respected, given gold medals and everything, but don’t give him power.\nYou will have to find people who can be creative – but these will be the people who have not participated in revolution.\nIt is a very delicate matter.\nBecause the creative people were concerned with their creativity, they were not interested in who rules. Somebody must rule, but whether it is the Britishers, or whether it is the Indians doesn’t matter to them. They were concerned with pouring their energy into their creative work, so they were not in the revolutionary ranks.\nNow, the revolutionaries will not allow them to have the power. In fact, they are the renegades. These are the people who never participated in revolution, and you are giving power to them?\nSo every revolution has failed in the world up to now, and for the simple reason that the people who make the revolution have one kind of expertise and the people who can make a country, create a country, create responsibility in people, are a different lot. They don’t participate in destruction, murder. But they cannot get to the power. Power goes into the hands of those who have been fighting.\nSo, naturally, every revolution is intrinsically bound to fail.\nUnless what I am saying is understood clearlyThere are two parts in revolution, from and for; and\nthere should be two kinds of revolutionaries: those who are working for the first – that is freedom from – and those who will work when the work of the first is finished, for freedom for.\nBut it is difficult to manage. Who will manage it? Everybody is full of lust for power.\nWhen the revolutionaries are victorious, the power is theirs; they cannot give it to anybody else. And the country will be in chaos. In every dimension it will fall lower and lower every day.\nThat’s why I don’t teach you revolution; I teach you rebellion. Revolution is of the crowd; rebellion is of the individual.\nThe individual changes himself. He does not care about the power structure; he simply manages to change his being, gives birth to a new man in himself.\nAnd if the whole country is rebellious.… The most wonderful thing about it is this: in rebellion both kinds of revolutionaries can participate, because in rebellion much has to be destroyed and much has to be created. Things have to be destroyed in order to create, so it has an appeal for both – those who are interested in destruction and those who are interested in creativity.\nIt is not a crowd phenomenon. It is your own individuality.\nAnd if millions of people go through rebellion, then the power of countries, nations is going to be in the hands of these people – rebels.\nOnly in rebellion can revolution succeed; otherwise, revolution has a split personality. Rebellion is one, single.\nAnd remember this: in rebellion, destructiveness and creativity go hand in hand together, supporting each other. They are not separate processes. Once you make them separate – as they are in revolution – you will repeat the story.\nThe story in the question is not complete.\nIt is a beautiful mystic story. A man comes to a master to ask how much man is independent, free. Is he totally free, or is there a limitation? Is there something like fate, kismet, destiny, a God who makes a limitation beyond which you cannot be free?\nThe mystic answered in his own way – not logically but existentially. He said, “Stand up.”\nThe man must have felt this was a stupid kind of answer, “I am asking a simple question and he is asking me to stand up.” But he said, “Let us see what happens.”\nHe stood.\nAnd the mystic said, “Now, raise one of your legs up.”\nThe man, by this time, must have been thinking he had come to a mad man; what has this to do with freedom, independence? But now that he has come... and there must have been a crowd of the disciples... and the mystic was so respected; not to follow him would be disrespectful, and there was no harm.\nSo he took away one of his legs from the earth, so one foot was in the air and he was standing on one foot.\nAnd then the master said, “That’s perfectly good. Just one thing more. Now take the other foot up also.”\nThat is impossible.\nThe man said, “You are asking something impossible. I have taken my right foot up. Now I cannot take my left foot up.”\nThe master said, “But you were free. In the beginning you could have taken the left foot up. There was no binding. You were completely free to choose whether to take the left foot up or the right foot up. I had not said anything. You decided. You took the right foot up. In your very decision you made it impossible for the left foot to be lifted up. Don’t bother about fate, kismet, God. Just think of simple things.”\nAny act that you do prevents you from doing some other act that goes against it. So every act is a limitation.\nIn the story it is so clear. In life it is not so clear because you can’t see one foot on the earth and one foot in the air. But each act, each decision is a limitation.\nYou are totally free before deciding, but once you have decided, your very decision, your very choice brings in a limitation. Nobody else is imposing the decision; it is the nature of things – you cannot do contradictory things together simultaneously. And it is good you cannot; otherwise... you are already in chaos... you would be in greater chaos if you were allowed to do contradictory things together. You would go mad.\nThis is simply an existential safety measure.\nBasically you are totally free to choose, but once you choose, your very choice brings a limitation.\nIf you want to remain totally free, then don’t choose. That’s where the teaching of choiceless awareness comes in. Why the insistence of the great masters just to be aware and not to choose? Because the moment you choose, you have lost your total freedom, you are left with only a part. But if you remain choiceless, your freedom remains total.\nSo there is only one thing which is totally free and that is choiceless awareness. Everything else is limited.\nYou love a woman – she is beautiful but very poor. You love riches – there is another woman who is very rich but ugly, disgusting. Now you have to choose. And whatever you choose, you will suffer. If you choose the beautiful girl, she is poor; and you will always repent that you missed all those riches unnecessarily – because the beauty after a few days’ acquaintance is taken for granted, you don’t see it. And what will you do with beauty? You cannot purchase a car, you cannot purchase a house, you cannot purchase anything. Now beat your head with your beauty – what you will do?\nSo the mind starts thinking that the choice was wrong.\nBut if you choose the disgusting, ugly woman, you would have all that money can purchase: a palace, servants, all gadgets, but you will have to tolerate that woman – not only tolerate but to say “I love you.” And you cannot even hate her, she is so disgusting; even to hate, one needs somebody who is not disgusting – because hate is a relationship. And you cannot enjoy those cars and the palace and the garden, because the disgusting face of that woman will be constantly following you. And she knows that you have not married her, you have married her riches. So she is going to treat you like a servant, not like a lover. And this is the truth: you have not loved her. Then you will start thinking it would have been better to have a poor house, ordinary food – at least the woman was beautiful, you would have enjoyed her. You have been an idiot to choose this.\nWhatever you choose you will repent because the other will remain and haunt you. If one needs absolute freedom then choiceless awareness is the only thing.\nAnd when I say instead of revolution go for rebellion, I am bringing you closer to a complete whole. In revolution you are bound to be divided, either from something or for something. You cannot have both together because they need different expertise.\nBut in rebellion both qualities are combined together.\nWhen a sculptor makes a statue he is doing both; he is cutting the stone – destroying the stone as it was – and he is, by destroying the stone, creating a beautiful statue that was not there before.\nDestruction and creation go together, they are not divided. Rebellion is whole.\nRevolution is half-half – and that is the danger of revolution. The word is beautiful, but down the centuries it has got connected with a split mind.\nAnd I am against all kinds of splits because they will drive you schizophrenic.\nNow all the countries which have become free from slavery are going into an agony which is inconceivable. They had never been in such agony when they were slaves, and they had been slaves for three hundred, four hundred years. In three hundred, four hundred years, they never encountered such agony; and just in thirty, forty years they have gone into such hell that they wonder, “Why were we fighting for freedom? If this is freedom then slavery was far better.”\nSlavery is never better. It is just that these people don’t know that they have chosen half of the freedom; and the other half can be completed, but not by the same people who have done the revolution. The other half will need a totally different kind of intelligence, wisdom. And those are not the people who will murder and throw bombs and burn trains and police stations and post offices – those are not the people.\nIn my family, only my grandfather was against sending my uncles to universities. It was my father who somehow managed to send them to the university. My grandfather was saying, “You don’t know. I understand these boys. You will be sending them to the university and they will end up in jail – such is the atmosphere.”\nMost of the revolution was done by students, young people. Knowing nothing of life – they had not experienced anything – but they had energy, they had vitality; they were young, and they had this romantic idea of being free. They did everything – making bombs and throwing bombs and killing governor-generals and governors. They did everything.\nAnd when they came out of jail, they suddenly found they had all the power and they had no skill to use it. They had no intelligence either – what to do with it? They pretended they enjoyed a euphoria, and the country also enjoyed euphoria for a moment – now our own people are in power! – but soon they started fighting with each other.\nFor forty years in India they have been simply fighting with each other. Nobody bothers about the country and nobody bothers to risk his own neck because to tackle any problem of the country he will have to go against the traditions of the country.\nI have talked to two prime ministers – Lalbahadur Shastri and Indira Gandhi – and the answer was the same: “Whatever you say is right, but who is going to get into trouble? We cannot say these things to the public. Birth control we cannot say because once you say birth control, the whole country goes against you, saying that you are destroying the morality of the country; then all religious people start thinking that this man should not be in power, he is dangerous.”\nAnd Indira even tried, and because she tried she was thrown out of power. For three years she was harassed in every possible way.\nWhat can you do? If the problems are connected with the traditions and the old conditionings of the mind.The politician is enjoying his power and he is fighting for his own power – so that he remains\npowerful, so that he starts moving upwards. I am reminded of a very funny situation.\nPandit Jawaharlal Nehru was the first prime minister after the freedom came, and he was visiting a Commonwealth conference in London. In his cabinet the second man was Maulana Azad. Thinking that since the prime minister is out of the country, and he is second.he must start acting as prime\nminister. Now there is no such thing in the world as an acting prime minister. If the president goes out, then the vice-president functions as the acting president. But the president is in the country, the head of the country is there. Prime ministers, wherever they go, are prime ministers and there is no need for anybody else to be acting prime minister.\nAnd Maulana Azad, an old man, very much respected.that’s why he is called Maulana. ‘Maulana’\nmeans a great wise man. He was a Mohammedan – but so childish that he immediately put the flag on the car of the prime minister and started sitting in the prime minister’s office, acting as prime minister.\nAnd when Jawaharlal Nehru heard in London that Maulana Azad was doing that, he informed him, “You do not know that there is never any acting prime minister. Only the head of the state, if he is out of the country, is replaced for the time being by the vice-head. But the prime minister is not the head of the country. He is the most powerful man, but he’s not the nominal head, so don’t do this foolish thing.”\nJawaharlal phoned him and said, “Stop this nonsense. If somebody comes to know it, they will laugh that these people want to create a country so big – a sub-continent – and they are only children.”\nRevolution has the trouble – and I think it will always have – that one kind of people will do it and power will come into their handsand it is just human, lust for power, will for power. They will not\nwant it to be given to anybody else. But that is exactly what is needed to be done. Now people have to be found who are wise enough – creative, intelligent – who can help the country in all possible ways by bringing new technology, new methods of agriculture; who can introduce new industries in the country; who can open the doors of the country for the whole world to put their money in, as the country has cheap labor.\nIndia can produce anything. It needs money, and the money is there around the world – and the people who have money, they don’t know what to do with it. It needs new industries. It can create any kind of thing, it just needs money, experts. And the labor is so cheap that it competes in the whole world.\nThat’s how Japan has come first. The per capita income is even higher now than in America. But Japan is handicapped with a trouble – it has not land enough. A small land... now it cannot grow more industries, the land is not there, the people are not there. India has enough land and millions of people. Only the right man is needed to be in power and then freedom from can be transformed into freedom for. The country can enjoy a tremendous growth in all directions.\nBut just the opposite is happening. The country is falling every day, deteriorating. And it will go on deteriorating and nobody will point out the simple fact that the wrong people are in power.\nJust give them honor, give them prizes, give them awards, great certificates written in golden letters that they can put in their houses – but don’t give them power.\nSeeing the disastrous situation of all revolutions, I started thinking of rebellion – which is individual; and the individual can be capable of synthesizing the destructive and the creative forces together in his choiceless awareness.\nAnd if many people go through this rebellion – which is not against anybody, it is just against your own conditioning – and bring forth a new man within you, the problem is not difficult.\nRevolution should become out of date. Rebellion is the word for the future.\nQuestion 3 BELOVED OSHO,\nDOES IT REALLY MATTER THAT I CAN’T DISTINGUISH IMAGINATION FROM REALITY? IF I CAN BE AWARE THAT “I AM”, IS THIS NOT ENOUGH?\nIt is certainly enough. It does not matter. There is no need to make any effort to discriminate between imagination and reality. You simply remain aware of yourself.\nAnd whatever is imagination will slowly disappear, and whatever is real will remain. It is again from Chetana.\nBut remember, your friendship with ghosts.… Those ghosts will disappear. Because you cannot discriminate between who is a ghost and who is a real person, there may be fear that perhaps you are thinking that this is a real person – and he disappears. But that much risk has to be taken.\nIn the commune Milarepa used to disappear. That was because of your awareness of yourself. Then you can’t find where he is.\nSo if you are not afraid, then there is no problem. You simply remain aware of yourself. And I have never been teaching discrimination.\nImagination is that which disappears. Reality is that which remains.\nSo you have to see. If Milarepa disappears, then he was a ghost. If he remains, then he is a reality. In life many things which you enjoy are imaginary; that’s why people don’t want to let them disappear. In life there is not much reality, so you don’t know what joys reality will bring. But one has to go into it. It is a gamble.\nOnly one thing I can say – that you will not be a loser. Reality is far richer than imagination.\nI have told you the story of Mulla Nasruddin. One night, in the middle of the night, he nudged his wife and whispered, “Just bring my glasses.”\nHe said, “Don’t ask. Just bring them. I will explain everything later on. This time don’t disturb me.” She said, “Okay,” and brought the glasses.\nHe put the glasses on, closed his eyes, started saying, “Okay, okay. I am ready for ninety-nine.” The wife said, “What is he doing?”\nThen he said, “Okay, I am ready for ninety-eight. But where are you? Ninety-seven?” The wife said, “Are you mad or what? What are you doing?”\nHe said, “I was having such a beautiful dream. An angel was giving rupees. I have never seen such a miserly angel. He started with one rupee. I said, ‘What do you think I am? A beggar? One rupee, no.’ With great trouble and struggle I brought him up to ninety-nine. And I said, ‘Listen, it doesn’t look right – ninety-nine. Why not make it one hundred?’\n“He said, ‘Okay, I will make it one hundred.’\n“I was so joyous that I woke up, and I thought that I would get my glasses to see whether those notes were real or imaginary – because he was giving... a miser who starts with one rupee and is ready for one hundred.…\n“But when I put on the glasses, he was not there. I tried hard; ‘Come on, I am ready for ninety-nine, ninety-eight.’ I even went down to one rupee... because even a rupee from an angel is a blessing. But that goddamned fellow did not appear at all!”\nSmall children sometimes wake up and start crying and weeping and asking for something they just had that now somebody has taken away. They were simply dreaming of something, and now that\nthey are awake, the thing has disappeared. They cannot make any distinction between dreaming and reality.\nAs you grow mature, you become more aware of the difference between imagination and reality.\nBut if you really become fully aware of yourself, imagination simply disappears, because it is a spiritual awakening. Now no dreaming is possible and only the reality remains, and that reality is tremendously fulfilling. One never feels any loss when imagination is gone.\nQuestion 4 BELOVED OSHO,\nMANEESHA HAS HER EDITING, BUT I’M TRYING HARD; I CAN’T SEEM TO FIND A GOOD REASON MYSELF FOR NOT BECOMING ENLIGHTENED.\nCAN YOU HELP ME?\nI will do my best so that you don’t become enlightened – although that is not my work, but just a favor.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"5367","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_transmission_of_the_lamp/part42/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_transmission_of_the_lamp/>The Transmission of the Lamp</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">42 Reality is far richer than imagination</h1><div class=post-meta>26 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;5367 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Transmission_of_the_Lamp/part42.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part41>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

IN HISTORY, YOU TOLD US TO FORGET HISTORY AND HISTORIANS, TO SIMPLY LET
THEM DO THEIR THING. BUT SO MUCH OF VALUE IS CONTAINED IN YOUR BOOKS
WHICH IS BEING MADE AVAILABLE TO CONTEMPORARY PEOPLE, AND WHICH COULD BE
PART OF A RECORD OF A WHOLE DIFFERENT DIMENSION FROM THAT WHICH IS
CONVENTIONALLY REGARDED AS HISTORY.</p><p><br></p><p>A NEW RECORD COULD BE COMPILED OF THE REAL HISTORY: THE EVOLUTION OF
MAN’S CONSCIOUSNESS BEGINNING WITH PRIMEVAL MAN AND THE FIRST HINTS OF
MAN’S AWARENESS OF HIMSELF, TAKING IN ALL THOSE WHO HAVE BECOME
AWAKENED, ALL MYSTICAL SCRIPTURES AND DOCUMENTS, AND CULMINATING IN YOU
AND YOUR WORK.</p><p><br></p><p>OF ALL THE MASTERS, YOU HAVE THE MOST ECLECTIC AND COMPREHENSIVE
RECORD OF YOUR OWN EVOLUTION IN CONSCIOUSNESS – FROM THOSE DAYS
IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING YOUR ENLIGHTENMENT, YOUR DAYS OF TRAVELLING AROUND
INDIA, TO BOMBAY, POONA, OREGON, AND NOW, THE WORLD TOUR.</p><p><br></p><p>IN ADDITION, THE QUESTIONS YOU PROVOKE IN US, YOUR DISCIPLES, OUTLINE
THE PROCESS OF OUR GROWING CONSCIOUSNESS, AND ARE, IN THEMSELVES,
ANOTHER UNIQUE ASPECT OF YOUR WORK.</p><p>OSHO, WE HAVE ALREADY FORGIVEN YOU FOR NOT ALLOWING US TO FORGET YOU.
WE, YOUR EDITORS, JUST WANT TO ENSURE THAT YOUR WORDS AND THE FRAGRANCE
THAT YOU ARE HAUNT PEOPLE FOR GENERATIONS TO COME AND DRIVE THEM TOTALLY
SANE!</p><p><br></p><p>That is your problem.</p><p><br></p><p>Next question.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>THERE IS A STORY OF A DISCIPLE WHO COMES TO SEE HIS MASTER AND ASKS
HIM WHETHER MAN IS FREE.</p><p><br></p><p>THE MASTER TELLS HIS DISCIPLE TO STAND UP AND TO LIFT ONE OF HIS FEET
OFF THE GROUND. THE DISCIPLE, STANDING ON ONE LEG – AND THE OTHER ONE IN
THE AIR – UNDERSTANDS LESS THAN BEFORE.</p><p><br></p><p>NOW THE MASTER ASKS HIM TO ALSO LIFT THE OTHER FOOT OFF THE
GROUND.</p><p><br></p><p>OSHO, CAN YOU SPEAK ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FREEDOM FOR AND FREEDOM
FROM?</p><p><br></p><p>Freedom from is ordinary, mundane. Man has always tried to be free
from things. It is not creative. It is the negative aspect of
freedom.</p><p><br></p><p>Freedom for is creativity. You have a certain vision that you would
like to materialize and you want freedom for it.</p><p><br></p><p>Freedom from is always from the past, and freedom for is always for
the future.</p><p><br></p><p>Freedom for is a spiritual dimension because you are moving into the
unknown and perhaps, one day, into the unknowable. It will give you
wings.</p><p><br></p><p>Freedom from, at the most, can take away your handcuffs. It is not
necessarily beneficial – and the whole of history is a proof of it.
People have never thought of the second freedom that I am insisting on;
they have only thought of the first – because they don’t have the
insight to see the second. The first is visible: chains on their feet,
handcuffs on their hands. They want to be free from them, but then what?
What are you going to do with your hands? You may even repent that you
asked for freedom from.</p><p><br></p><p>It happened in the castle of the Bastille – I have told you – in the
French Revolution it was the most famous French prison, it was reserved
only for those who were sentenced to live in jail for their whole lives.
So one entered the Bastille alive but never came out alive – only the
dead bodies came out.</p><p><br></p><p>And when they put on the handcuffs, the chains, they locked them and
threw the keys in a well which was inside the Bastille – because they
were not needed. Those locks would not be opened again so what would be
their use?</p><p>There were more than five thousand people. What is the use of keeping
five thousand peoples’ keys and maintaining them unnecessarily?</p><p><br></p><p>Once they have entered their dark cells, they have entered them
forever.</p><p><br></p><p>The French revolutionaries necessarily thought that the first thing
that had to be done was to free the people from the Bastille.</p><p><br></p><p>It is inhuman to put somebody for any act whatsoever into prison in a
dark cell just to wait for his death which might come fifty years
afterwards, sixty years afterwards. Sixty years of waiting is an immense
torture to the soul. It is not punishment, it is vengeance, revenge,
because these people disobeyed the law. There is no balance between
their acts and the punishment.</p><p><br></p><p>The revolutionaries opened the doors, they dragged people out from
their dark cells. And they were surprised. Those people were not ready
to get out of their cells.</p><p><br></p><p>You can understand. A person who has lived for sixty years in
darkness – the sun is too much for him. He does not want to come out
into the light. His eyes have become too delicate. And what is the
point? He is now eighty. When he entered he was twenty. His whole life
has been in this darkness. This darkness has become his home.</p><p><br></p><p>And they wanted to make them free. They broke their chains, their
handcuffs – because there were no keys. But the prisoners were very
resistant. They did not want to go out of the prison. They said, “You
don’t understand our condition. A man who has been sixty years in this
position, what will he do outside? Who will provide him food? Here food
is given, and he can rest in his peaceful, dark cell. He knows he is
almost dead. Outside he will not be able to find his wife – what has
happened to her, his parents will have died, his friends will have died
or may have completely forgotten him.</p><p><br></p><p>“And nobody is going to give him a job. A man who has been for sixty
years out of work, who is going to give him a job? – and a man from the
Bastille, where the most dangerous criminals were kept? Just the name of
Bastille will be enough to have him refused from any job. Why are you
forcing us? Where will we sleep? We don’t have any houses. We have
almost forgotten where we used to live – somebody else must be living
there. Our houses, our families, our friends, our whole world has
changed so much in sixty years; we will not be able to make it. Don’t
torture us more. We have been tortured enough.”</p><p><br></p><p>And in what they were saying there was reasonableness.</p><p><br></p><p>But revolutionaries are stubborn people; they won’t listen. They
forced them out of the Bastille, but by that night almost everybody had
come back. They said, “Give us food because we are hungry.”</p><p><br></p><p>A few came in the middle of the night and they said, “Give us our
chains back because we cannot sleep without them. We have slept for
fifty, sixty years with handcuffs, with chains on our legs, in darkness.
They have become almost part of our bodies, we cannot sleep without
them. You return our chains – and we want our cells. We were perfectly
happy. Don’t force your revolution on us. We are poor people. You can do
your revolution somewhere else.”</p><p><br></p><p>The revolutionaries were shocked.</p><p>But the incident shows that freedom from is not necessarily a
blessing.</p><p><br></p><p>You can see all over the world; countries have become free from the
British Empire, from the Spanish Empire, from the Portuguese Empire –
but their situation is far worse than it was when they were slaves. At
least in their slavery they had become accustomed to it, they had
dropped ambitions, they had accepted their situation as their
destiny.</p><p><br></p><p>Freedom from slavery simply creates chaos.</p><p><br></p><p>My whole family was involved in India’s freedom struggle. They had
all been to jail. Their education was disturbed. Nobody could pass the
university because before they could pass the examination they were
caught – somebody was three years in jail, somebody was four years in
jail. And then it was too late to start again, and they had become bona
fide revolutionaries. In jail they contacted all the leaders of
revolution; then their whole lives were devoted to revolution.</p><p><br></p><p>I was small but I used to argue with my father, with my uncles: “I
can understand that slavery is ugly, it dehumanizes you, humiliates you,
it degrades you from the prestige of being a human being; it should be
fought against. But my point is, what will you do when you are free?
Freedom from is clear, and I am not against it. What I want to know and
understand clearly is what you are going to do with your freedom.</p><p><br></p><p>“You know how to live in slavery. Do you know how to live in freedom?
You know a certain order has to be maintained in slavery; otherwise you
will be crushed, killed, shot. Do you know that in freedom it will be
your responsibility to maintain the order? Nobody will be killing you
and nobody else will be responsible for it – you have to be responsible
for it. Have you asked your leaders what this freedom is for?”</p><p><br></p><p>And I never received any answer. They said, “Right now we are so
involved in getting rid of slavery; we will take care of freedom later
on.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “This is not a scientific attitude. If you are demolishing
the old house, if you are intelligent you should at least prepare a map
for the new house. The best would be that you prepare the new house
before you demolish the old. Otherwise you will be without a house and
then you will suffer – because it is better to be in the old house than
to be without a house.”</p><p><br></p><p>In my family, great leaders of the Indian revolution used to stay
with us – and this was my constant argument with them. And I have never
found a single leader of the Indian revolution who had the answer to
what they were going to do with freedom.</p><p><br></p><p>Freedom came. Hindus and Mohammedans killed each other in millions.
They had been kept from killing each other by the British forces; the
forces were removed – and there were riots all over India. Everybody’s
life was in danger. Whole towns were burning; whole trains were burning,
and people were not allowed to get out of the trains.</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “This is strange. It was not happening in slavery, and it is
happening in freedom – and the reason simply is that you were not
prepared for what freedom is.”</p><p>The country was divided into two parts – they had never thought about
it. In the whole country there was chaos. And the people who came to
power had a certain expertise and that expertise was in burning the
bridges, in burning the jails, in killing the people who were enslaving
the country. This expertise has nothing to do with building up a new
country. But these were the leaders in the revolution; naturally they
came to power. They had fought, they had won, and the power came into
their hands. And it was in the wrong hands.</p><p><br></p><p>No revolutionary should be given the power – because he knows how to
sabotage, but he does not know how to create; he only knows how to
destroy. He should be honored, respected, given gold medals and
everything, but don’t give him power.</p><p><br></p><p>You will have to find people who can be creative – but these will be
the people who have not participated in revolution.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a very delicate matter.</p><p><br></p><p>Because the creative people were concerned with their creativity,
they were not interested in who rules. Somebody must rule, but whether
it is the Britishers, or whether it is the Indians doesn’t matter to
them. They were concerned with pouring their energy into their creative
work, so they were not in the revolutionary ranks.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, the revolutionaries will not allow them to have the power. In
fact, they are the renegades. These are the people who never
participated in revolution, and you are giving power to them?</p><p><br></p><p>So every revolution has failed in the world up to now, and for the
simple reason that the people who make the revolution have one kind of
expertise and the people who can make a country, create a country,
create responsibility in people, are a different lot. They don’t
participate in destruction, murder. But they cannot get to the power.
Power goes into the hands of those who have been fighting.</p><p><br></p><p>So, naturally, every revolution is intrinsically bound to fail.</p><p><br></p><p>Unless what I am saying is understood clearly<span class=s4></span>There are two parts in revolution, from and for;
and</p><p>there should be two kinds of revolutionaries: those who are working
for the first – that is freedom from – and those who will work when the
work of the first is finished, for freedom for.</p><p><br></p><p>But it is difficult to manage. Who will manage it? Everybody is full
of lust for power.</p><p><br></p><p>When the revolutionaries are victorious, the power is theirs; they
cannot give it to anybody else. And the country will be in chaos. In
every dimension it will fall lower and lower every day.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why I don’t teach you revolution; I teach you rebellion.
Revolution is of the crowd; rebellion is of the individual.</p><p>The individual changes himself. He does not care about the power
structure; he simply manages to change his being, gives birth to a new
man in himself.</p><p>And if the whole country is rebellious.… The most wonderful thing
about it is this: in rebellion both kinds of revolutionaries can
participate, because in rebellion much has to be destroyed and much has
to be created. Things have to be destroyed in order to create, so it has
an appeal for both – those who are interested in destruction and those
who are interested in creativity.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not a crowd phenomenon. It is your own individuality.</p><p><br></p><p>And if millions of people go through rebellion, then the power of
countries, nations is going to be in the hands of these people –
rebels.</p><p><br></p><p>Only in rebellion can revolution succeed; otherwise, revolution has a
split personality. Rebellion is one, single.</p><p>And remember this: in rebellion, destructiveness and creativity go
hand in hand together, supporting each other. They are not separate
processes. Once you make them separate – as they are in revolution – you
will repeat the story.</p><p><br></p><p>The story in the question is not complete.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a beautiful mystic story. A man comes to a master to ask how
much man is independent, free. Is he totally free, or is there a
limitation? Is there something like fate, kismet, destiny, a God who
makes a limitation beyond which you cannot be free?</p><p><br></p><p>The mystic answered in his own way – not logically but existentially.
He said, “Stand up.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man must have felt this was a stupid kind of answer, “I am asking
a simple question and he is asking me to stand up.” But he said, “Let us
see what happens.”</p><p><br></p><p>He stood.</p><p><br></p><p>And the mystic said, “Now, raise one of your legs up.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man, by this time, must have been thinking he had come to a mad
man; what has this to do with freedom, independence? But now that he has
come... and there must have been a crowd of the disciples... and the
mystic was so respected; not to follow him would be disrespectful, and
there was no harm.</p><p><br></p><p>So he took away one of his legs from the earth, so one foot was in
the air and he was standing on one foot.</p><p><br></p><p>And then the master said, “That’s perfectly good. Just one thing
more. Now take the other foot up also.”</p><p><br></p><p>That is impossible.</p><p><br></p><p>The man said, “You are asking something impossible. I have taken my
right foot up. Now I cannot take my left foot up.”</p><p>The master said, “But you were free. In the beginning you could have
taken the left foot up. There was no binding. You were completely free
to choose whether to take the left foot up or the right foot up. I had
not said anything. You decided. You took the right foot up. In your very
decision you made it impossible for the left foot to be lifted up. Don’t
bother about fate, kismet, God. Just think of simple things.”</p><p><br></p><p>Any act that you do prevents you from doing some other act that goes
against it. So every act is a limitation.</p><p><br></p><p>In the story it is so clear. In life it is not so clear because you
can’t see one foot on the earth and one foot in the air. But each act,
each decision is a limitation.</p><p><br></p><p>You are totally free before deciding, but once you have decided, your
very decision, your very choice brings in a limitation. Nobody else is
imposing the decision; it is the nature of things – you cannot do
contradictory things together simultaneously. And it is good you cannot;
otherwise... you are already in chaos... you would be in greater chaos
if you were allowed to do contradictory things together. You would go
mad.</p><p><br></p><p>This is simply an existential safety measure.</p><p><br></p><p>Basically you are totally free to choose, but once you choose, your
very choice brings a limitation.</p><p><br></p><p>If you want to remain totally free, then don’t choose. That’s where
the teaching of choiceless awareness comes in. Why the insistence of the
great masters just to be aware and not to choose? Because the moment you
choose, you have lost your total freedom, you are left with only a part.
But if you remain choiceless, your freedom remains total.</p><p><br></p><p>So there is only one thing which is totally free and that is
choiceless awareness. Everything else is limited.</p><p><br></p><p>You love a woman – she is beautiful but very poor. You love riches –
there is another woman who is very rich but ugly, disgusting. Now you
have to choose. And whatever you choose, you will suffer. If you choose
the beautiful girl, she is poor; and you will always repent that you
missed all those riches unnecessarily – because the beauty after a few
days’ acquaintance is taken for granted, you don’t see it. And what will
you do with beauty? You cannot purchase a car, you cannot purchase a
house, you cannot purchase anything. Now beat your head with your beauty
– what you will do?</p><p><br></p><p>So the mind starts thinking that the choice was wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>But if you choose the disgusting, ugly woman, you would have all that
money can purchase: a palace, servants, all gadgets, but you will have
to tolerate that woman – not only tolerate but to say “I love you.” And
you cannot even hate her, she is so disgusting; even to hate, one needs
somebody who is not disgusting – because hate is a relationship. And you
cannot enjoy those cars and the palace and the garden, because the
disgusting face of that woman will be constantly following you. And she
knows that you have not married her, you have married her riches. So she
is going to treat you like a servant, not like a lover. And this is the
truth: you have not loved her. Then you will start thinking it would
have been better to have a poor house, ordinary food – at least the
woman was beautiful, you would have enjoyed her. You have been an idiot
to choose this.</p><p>Whatever you choose you will repent because the other will remain and
haunt you. If one needs absolute freedom then choiceless awareness is
the only thing.</p><p>And when I say instead of revolution go for rebellion, I am bringing
you closer to a complete whole. In revolution you are bound to be
divided, either from something or for something. You cannot have both
together because they need different expertise.</p><p><br></p><p>But in rebellion both qualities are combined together.</p><p><br></p><p>When a sculptor makes a statue he is doing both; he is cutting the
stone – destroying the stone as it was – and he is, by destroying the
stone, creating a beautiful statue that was not there before.</p><p><br></p><p>Destruction and creation go together, they are not divided. Rebellion
is whole.</p><p>Revolution is half-half – and that is the danger of revolution. The
word is beautiful, but down the centuries it has got connected with a
split mind.</p><p><br></p><p>And I am against all kinds of splits because they will drive you
schizophrenic.</p><p><br></p><p>Now all the countries which have become free from slavery are going
into an agony which is inconceivable. They had never been in such agony
when they were slaves, and they had been slaves for three hundred, four
hundred years. In three hundred, four hundred years, they never
encountered such agony; and just in thirty, forty years they have gone
into such hell that they wonder, “Why were we fighting for freedom? If
this is freedom then slavery was far better.”</p><p><br></p><p>Slavery is never better. It is just that these people don’t know that
they have chosen half of the freedom; and the other half can be
completed, but not by the same people who have done the revolution. The
other half will need a totally different kind of intelligence, wisdom.
And those are not the people who will murder and throw bombs and burn
trains and police stations and post offices – those are not the
people.</p><p><br></p><p>In my family, only my grandfather was against sending my uncles to
universities. It was my father who somehow managed to send them to the
university. My grandfather was saying, “You don’t know. I understand
these boys. You will be sending them to the university and they will end
up in jail – such is the atmosphere.”</p><p><br></p><p>Most of the revolution was done by students, young people. Knowing
nothing of life – they had not experienced anything – but they had
energy, they had vitality; they were young, and they had this romantic
idea of being free. They did everything – making bombs and throwing
bombs and killing governor-generals and governors. They did
everything.</p><p><br></p><p>And when they came out of jail, they suddenly found they had all the
power and they had no skill to use it. They had no intelligence either –
what to do with it? They pretended they enjoyed a euphoria, and the
country also enjoyed euphoria for a moment – now our own people are in
power! – but soon they started fighting with each other.</p><p>For forty years in India they have been simply fighting with each
other. Nobody bothers about the country and nobody bothers to risk his
own neck because to tackle any problem of the country he will have to go
against the traditions of the country.</p><p><br></p><p>I have talked to two prime ministers – Lalbahadur Shastri and Indira
Gandhi – and the answer was the same: “Whatever you say is right, but
who is going to get into trouble? We cannot say these things to the
public. Birth control we cannot say because once you say birth control,
the whole country goes against you, saying that you are destroying the
morality of the country; then all religious people start thinking that
this man should not be in power, he is dangerous.”</p><p><br></p><p>And Indira even tried, and because she tried she was thrown out of
power. For three years she was harassed in every possible way.</p><p><br></p><p>What can you do? If the problems are connected with the traditions
and the old conditionings of the mind.<span class=s4></span>The
politician is enjoying his power and he is fighting for his own power –
so that he remains</p><p>powerful, so that he starts moving upwards. I am reminded of a very
funny situation.</p><p>Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru was the first prime minister after the
freedom came, and he was visiting a Commonwealth conference in London.
In his cabinet the second man was Maulana Azad. Thinking that since the
prime minister is out of the country, and he is second.<span class=s4></span>he must start acting as prime</p><p>minister. Now there is no such thing in the world as an acting prime
minister. If the president goes out, then the vice-president functions
as the acting president. But the president is in the country, the head
of the country is there. Prime ministers, wherever they go, are prime
ministers and there is no need for anybody else to be acting prime
minister.</p><p><br></p><p>And Maulana Azad, an old man, very much respected.<span class=s4></span>that’s why he is called Maulana. ‘Maulana’</p><p>means a great wise man. He was a Mohammedan – but so childish that he
immediately put the flag on the car of the prime minister and started
sitting in the prime minister’s office, acting as prime minister.</p><p><br></p><p>And when Jawaharlal Nehru heard in London that Maulana Azad was doing
that, he informed him, “You do not know that there is never any acting
prime minister. Only the head of the state, if he is out of the country,
is replaced for the time being by the vice-head. But the prime minister
is not the head of the country. He is the most powerful man, but he’s
not the nominal head, so don’t do this foolish thing.”</p><p><br></p><p>Jawaharlal phoned him and said, “Stop this nonsense. If somebody
comes to know it, they will laugh that these people want to create a
country so big – a sub-continent – and they are only children.”</p><p><br></p><p>Revolution has the trouble – and I think it will always have – that
one kind of people will do it and power will come into their hands<span class=s4></span>and it is just human, lust for power, will for power.
They will not</p><p>want it to be given to anybody else. But that is exactly what is
needed to be done. Now people have to be found who are wise enough –
creative, intelligent – who can help the country in all possible ways by
bringing new technology, new methods of agriculture; who can introduce
new industries in the country; who can open the doors of the country for
the whole world to put their money in, as the country has cheap
labor.</p><p>India can produce anything. It needs money, and the money is there
around the world – and the people who have money, they don’t know what
to do with it. It needs new industries. It can create any kind of thing,
it just needs money, experts. And the labor is so cheap that it competes
in the whole world.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s how Japan has come first. The per capita income is even higher
now than in America. But Japan is handicapped with a trouble – it has
not land enough. A small land... now it cannot grow more industries, the
land is not there, the people are not there. India has enough land and
millions of people. Only the right man is needed to be in power and then
freedom from can be transformed into freedom for. The country can enjoy
a tremendous growth in all directions.</p><p><br></p><p>But just the opposite is happening. The country is falling every day,
deteriorating. And it will go on deteriorating and nobody will point out
the simple fact that the wrong people are in power.</p><p><br></p><p>Just give them honor, give them prizes, give them awards, great
certificates written in golden letters that they can put in their houses
– but don’t give them power.</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing the disastrous situation of all revolutions, I started
thinking of rebellion – which is individual; and the individual can be
capable of synthesizing the destructive and the creative forces together
in his choiceless awareness.</p><p><br></p><p>And if many people go through this rebellion – which is not against
anybody, it is just against your own conditioning – and bring forth a
new man within you, the problem is not difficult.</p><p><br></p><p>Revolution should become out of date. Rebellion is the word for the
future.</p><p>Question 3 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>DOES IT REALLY MATTER THAT I CAN’T DISTINGUISH IMAGINATION FROM
REALITY? IF I CAN BE AWARE THAT “I AM”, IS THIS NOT ENOUGH?</p><p>It is certainly enough. It does not matter. There is no need to make
any effort to discriminate between imagination and reality. You simply
remain aware of yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>And whatever is imagination will slowly disappear, and whatever is
real will remain. It is again from Chetana.</p><p>But remember, your friendship with ghosts.… Those ghosts will
disappear. Because you cannot discriminate between who is a ghost and
who is a real person, there may be fear that perhaps you are thinking
that this is a real person – and he disappears. But that much risk has
to be taken.</p><p>In the commune Milarepa used to disappear. That was because of your
awareness of yourself. Then you can’t find where he is.</p><p><br></p><p>So if you are not afraid, then there is no problem. You simply remain
aware of yourself. And I have never been teaching discrimination.</p><p><br></p><p>Imagination is that which disappears. Reality is that which
remains.</p><p>So you have to see. If Milarepa disappears, then he was a ghost. If
he remains, then he is a reality. In life many things which you enjoy
are imaginary; that’s why people don’t want to let them disappear. In
life there is not much reality, so you don’t know what joys reality will
bring. But one has to go into it. It is a gamble.</p><p><br></p><p>Only one thing I can say – that you will not be a loser. Reality is
far richer than imagination.</p><p><br></p><p>I have told you the story of Mulla Nasruddin. One night, in the
middle of the night, he nudged his wife and whispered, “Just bring my
glasses.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Don’t ask. Just bring them. I will explain everything later
on. This time don’t disturb me.” She said, “Okay,” and brought the
glasses.</p><p>He put the glasses on, closed his eyes, started saying, “Okay, okay.
I am ready for ninety-nine.” The wife said, “What is he doing?”</p><p>Then he said, “Okay, I am ready for ninety-eight. But where are you?
Ninety-seven?” The wife said, “Are you mad or what? What are you
doing?”</p><p>He said, “I was having such a beautiful dream. An angel was giving
rupees. I have never seen such a miserly angel. He started with one
rupee. I said, ‘What do you think I am? A beggar? One rupee, no.’ With
great trouble and struggle I brought him up to ninety-nine. And I said,
‘Listen, it doesn’t look right – ninety-nine. Why not make it one
hundred?’</p><p><br></p><p>“He said, ‘Okay, I will make it one hundred.’</p><p><br></p><p>“I was so joyous that I woke up, and I thought that I would get my
glasses to see whether those notes were real or imaginary – because he
was giving... a miser who starts with one rupee and is ready for one
hundred.…</p><p><br></p><p>“But when I put on the glasses, he was not there. I tried hard; ‘Come
on, I am ready for ninety-nine, ninety-eight.’ I even went down to one
rupee... because even a rupee from an angel is a blessing. But that
goddamned fellow did not appear at all!”</p><p><br></p><p>Small children sometimes wake up and start crying and weeping and
asking for something they just had that now somebody has taken away.
They were simply dreaming of something, and now that</p><p>they are awake, the thing has disappeared. They cannot make any
distinction between dreaming and reality.</p><p><br></p><p>As you grow mature, you become more aware of the difference between
imagination and reality.</p><p><br></p><p>But if you really become fully aware of yourself, imagination simply
disappears, because it is a spiritual awakening. Now no dreaming is
possible and only the reality remains, and that reality is tremendously
fulfilling. One never feels any loss when imagination is gone.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 4 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>MANEESHA HAS HER EDITING, BUT I’M TRYING HARD; I CAN’T SEEM TO FIND A
GOOD REASON MYSELF FOR NOT BECOMING ENLIGHTENED.</p><p><br></p><p>CAN YOU HELP ME?</p><p><br></p><p>I will do my best so that you don’t become enlightened – although
that is not my work, but just a favor.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part41>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

I WENT FOR IT WHOLEHEARTEDLY, AND THE RESULT WAS TO SEND MYSELF EVEN HIGHER: I FELT EUPHORIC AND SO GRATEFUL.\nI AM STILL LEFT WITH AN ALMOST UNCONTAINABLE ENERGY WHICH SEEMS COMPOSED OF SENSUALITY AND OF LOVINGNESS.\nIF I GO INTO IT, I RISK HURTING OTHER PEOPLE; BUT THE ALTERNATIVE SEEMS A COMPROMISE. SITTING AND WATCHING IT DRIVES ME BANANAS!\nOSHO, MY MAIN QUESTION IS: WHAT IS IT THAT I HAVE LEARNED FROM THIS EXPERIENCE, AND HOW TO USE THIS SO AS NOT TO BE TAKEN OVER AGAIN BY JEALOUSY? HOW TO ENJOY THE FREEDOM TO EXPRESS SENSUALITY WITHOUT COMPROMISING, GETTING FRUSTRATED OR SLIPPING ON THE BANANA?\nVivek, it has been a very meaningful experience for you, one of the key experiences which can help one to change one’s energy totally.\nGeorge Gurdjieff used to find the first thing in his disciples – the characteristic that was their number one enemy because their number one enemy contains the key which either can destroy them if they don’t understand it or can bring a transformation.\nYou faced jealousy. Jealousy is one of the most dangerous elements in human consciousness, particularly in the female mind. To face your number one enemy without hiding it, without whitewashing it, without trying to interpret it favorably – that you are right, the situation is such that of course you have to be jealous – without in any way satisfying yourself by explanations that the jealousy was right.\nIf you satisfy yourself that it is right, it is going to remain and it will become more powerful; then the energy that you are feeling now, you would not feel, this energy would have been absorbed by jealousy, it would have remained contained in jealousy, and would have remained looking for a moment when it could explode – to find some excuse. But because you faced it without bringing any explanation to explain it away... you did not justify it, you simply faced it as a fact, that you have this jealousy... and you accepted it, that it has something to do with you, not with anyone else, that nobody else in the whole world is responsible for it.\nAll those are excuses to protect it.\nYou did a good job, and the result is that just being watchful the jealousy disappeared.\nAnd that’s what I have been telling you continually for years, that nothing has to be done; simply face a problem the way a mirror reflects something, with no judgment.\nAnd because it was your number one enemy, it contained a lot of energy. Now it is gone, and the energy is free. That’s why you are feeling more alive, more loving, more sensuous.\nRemember one thing: again you can commit the same mistake. Don’t condemn sensuality. It has been condemned by the whole world, and because of their condemnation the energy that can flower in sensuality moves into perversions, jealousy, anger, hatred – a kind of life which is dry, with no juice. Sensuousness is your very life. That is the difference between you and a stone – because the stone is not sensuous. The more sensuous you are, you more alive you are. And if your whole energy is released in loving, in being playfully sensuous without holding yourself back, without any fear – there is nothing to be afraid of. Sensuousness is one of the greatest blessings to humanity; it is your sensitivity, it is your consciousness; consciousness filtering through the body is what sensuousness is.\nRemember never to compromise. Compromise is absolutely against my whole vision.\nYou see the people. They are miserable because they have compromised on every point, and they cannot forgive themselves because they have compromised. They know that they could have dared, but they proved cowards. In their own eyes they have fallen, they have lost self-respect; that’s what compromise does.\nWhy should one compromise? What have we got to lose? In this small life, live as totally as possible. Don’t be afraid of going to the extreme, you cannot go more than total, that is the last line; and don’t\ncompromise. Your whole mind will go for compromise because that’s how we have been brought up, conditioned.\nCompromise is one of the most ugly words in our language. It means, “I give half, you give half; I settle for half, you settle for half.” But why? When you can have the whole, when you can eat the cake and have it too, then why compromise?\nJust a little courage, just a little daring – and only in the beginning. Once you have experienced the beauty of non-compromising and the dignity that it brings, and the joy, and the integrity, and the individuality, for the first time you feel that you have roots, that you have a center, that you live out of your own, you don’t live like a businessman – living life like a businessman is prostitution.\nLive like a warrior.\nThis way or that, but never compromising. It is better to be defeated, but totally, than to be victorious through a compromise; that victory will not give you anything except humiliation, and the defeat without compromise will still give you dignity.\nLife is mysterious.\nHere sometimes victory is just shameful and defeat is a dignity because one would not compromise.\nSo whatever sensuality you feel, whatever love you feel, just don’t keep them in your mind; otherwise, they get sour, they get bitter. Express them.\nAnd remember one thing, that expression is always a tremendous release of your own energy; otherwise, your energy goes on accumulating and becomes a burden. And when it becomes a burden, you start throwing the responsibility on other people because you are sad, you are heavy, somebody must be doing something wrong. If you are sad, you are wrong; if you are joyful, you are right.\nIt has been almost a criterion to me that anybody who is sad, complaining, grumpy, is wrong, is bound to be wrong. He may find a thousand and one reasons why he is sad. I don’t accept it. He is sad because he has not allowed his life to blossom. He has been holding back. Even when people want to love each other, they are holding back – because all the religions have poisoned love. They have not been able to destroy it, but they have succeeded in poisoning it.\nAnd sensuality is so much condemned, and if you condemn sensuality then what is to remain? Then man remains like a marble statue – you touch his hand and you feel like you are shaking hands with a dead branch. All his energy has shrunken in himself – rather than blossoming in flowers, it has become complexes within himself which are making him sad.\nAt least my people should never think of compromise. Compromise for what? Be true. Be honest. Be sincere. Love as much as you can. Enjoy your sensuality – it is a gift of nature. And be watchful, because what you are enjoying is everybody else’s right too. Otherwise there will be conflict. Because of that conflict people compromise.\nIf you enjoy intense living, you should appreciate everybody who is living intensely. With whom he is living does not matter – because we are all one life, one life force.\nAll the traditions have been against expressiveness because a person who is expressive attains a certain kind of solidity, a freedom. You cannot enslave him. He lives according to his own nature. You cannot force him. You cannot make him a husband or a wife. That’s why the society has tried hard to repress, because the repressed person is so much reduced – he’s almost like the castrated bull.\nYou cannot use a bull in a bullock cart. The bull is too powerful. He can take your bullock cart and you anywhere, where you never wanted to go. You cannot control him. And if he comes across a beautiful female, he will simply jump out of your bullock cart. What happens to you and your bullock cart, that is your business. He will start a love affair immediately, not bothering at all that you are under the bullock cart, the bullock cart is upside down.\nMan must have learned very early that bulls cannot be used, they are useless.\nBut they found the idea of why they are useless, because they are so full of energy, and so sensuous, and so loving.\nPeople started castrating them, and once a bull is castrated you have reduced him to a totally different being that he was not destined to be. Now you can use him in a bullock cart. You can enslave him. You can use him in farms, and wherever you want. You have destroyed his possibility of regenerative forces. You have done a crime against nature. Now the cow may be passing by his side, he will not even look at her, he doesn’t have energy.\nIn my childhood when I saw the farmers castrating the bulls, I inquired what is the matter. My father said, “When you are old enough you will understand.”\nI said, “I don’t want to wait. I want to understand now, why these poor creatures are being tortured.” He said, “You just wait.”\nAnd when I understood, I told him that, “You have not only been doing that to bulls, you have been doing that to human beings too – in a different way, not physiologically but psychologically.”\nAll the religions are castrating human beings. For example, all over the world ladies are told that while making love they should not show any sign of joy. What nonsense. Even while making love they are not allowed to show any signs of joy because that is what prostitutes do, not ladies – and this is compromise. Being ladies they compromised. So when the man is making love to them, they are lying down with closed eyes, because even to open their eyes is not right for a lady – to see such an ugly scene, that the beast on top of them is doing push-ups. It is not lady-like. It is better to keep your eyes closed. And don’t move.\nFor thousands of years women had no knowledge of orgasm – and even today in the East, almost ninety-nine percent of women don’t know what orgasm is. And the same was the story all over the world because they never moved, they never enjoyed, they never allowed their body to dance.\nThere is a difference between man’s and woman’s sexuality. Man’s sex is local, it is genital. Woman’s sexuality is more sensuality than sexuality, it is all over her body. Unless her whole body participates, she will not experience the orgasmic joy – which is the greatest gift nature has given.\nAnd it is really shocking and surprising, that because man destroyed the woman, because she was not allowed to enjoy lovingness, he himself was alone making the push-ups. There was no other.\nI have heard of a drunkard who was walking on the beach... and then he saw a man doing push-ups. The drunkard looked down, looked from this side and that side, went around, tapped the man, and said, “Boy, your girl is gone. Why are you unnecessarily tiring your body? Go home.”\nBut this is really the situation, and the by-product is that these same so-called gentlemen who produced this ugly situation – that they made their own wives non-sensuous, dry – created many things because these women became angry, nagging, fighting. These were just perversions of the energy that could have become flowers, fragrance. And on the other hand, these gentlemen had to go to prostitutes; they created prostitutes – which was another ugliness. To force women just for money, to sell their bodies – because with their own wives they themselves could not get the orgasm. Ejaculation is not orgasm. They could produce children but they could not produce orgasm.\nOrgasm needs both the partners in a sensuous dance.\nTo create the ladies, they had to reduce other poor women into prostitutes. It is such an ugly society, so nauseating, if you look into its structure and the way it has behaved and destroyed man.\nAt least my people should be totally free. They should love. And there is no lady here, and there is no gentleman here; here are only men and women, real men and real women.\nAnd be sensuous. Enjoy life to its fullest, and help others also to enjoy the life to its fullest. And you will find, strangely, that because of your love, your sensuousness, all your ugly traits have disappeared because they no more get any energy – they were perversions, they were by-products of your compromises. No compromise for any reason – respectability, honor, all are nonsense.\nHow many million people have lived before you? And do you remember a few names who were very respectable, very honorable, and they had sacrificed their whole life for their honor and their respectability, and now even their names?... Nobody knows whether they ever happened or not.\nIn Jaina mythology there is a very beautiful story. I have loved it very much. In Jaina mythology if a king conquers the whole world he’s called the chakravartin. chakra means wheel, as if the world is a wheel – it is a wheel – and he has conquered it completely. And the mythology is that in heaven only chakravartins are allowed to make their signatures on a golden mountain.\nOne man became a chakravartin, and he was very happy that now he will be able to write his name on the golden mountain. Very few people – once in a while – have been able to write their names. The mountain is enormous. As he died and entered the gates of heaven, the doorkeeper said, “You have to sign your signature on the golden mountain, but go alone. Don’t take anybody with you.”\nHe said, “Why? I would like a few of my friends who have died before me and who must be here to be with me; otherwise, what is the joy of signing on the golden mountain? Nobody is watching you, nobody will ever know that you have signed there.”\nThe doorkeeper said, “Listen to me. I have been on this post... before me was my father, and this is our heritage. For centuries our family has kept this post. And to everybody who has gone to sign, this was suggested; and everybody wanted the same that you are wanting. And afterwards, everybody thanked us, ‘It was so kind of you to have prevented me from taking anybody.’ So please go alone.”\nReluctantly he went in, and the mountain keeper opened the doors and said, “There is a difficulty. The mountain is full of names. There is no space. And this is not only with you; before me my father was here, before him his father was here. This is our family post. And I have heard that since centuries this has been the case, that the mountain is full. So every time a new person comes, first you have to erase one name and then sign your name. There is no other way; there is no space.”\nThen he recognized that it is good that he has not brought his friends to see. A great mountain and there is not even a small space for his signature.\nBut he was – he must have been – a man of understanding. He said, “I will not erase, because what is the point? Somebody will come tomorrow and erase my name and will sign his. This is all futile. So my being chakravartin, a world conqueror, is useless and I was thinking that it happens only once in a while. I was wrong. This whole mountain is full of signatures.”\nJust a small life you have. Don’t bother about any respectability, don’t bother about any honor, don’t bother about what others will say. Simply listen to your own energy and follow it. I call it courage. Be sensuous, be loving, and if you can be totally loving and sensuous there is a possibility one day to transcend, to come to a point of awareness where all your energy turns into just a flame of awareness – all your sensuality, all your sexuality, all your love, everything in you – turns into a flame that has been called enlightenment, awakening; a flame that remains forever in the universe without taking another form again, because it has used the whole potential of forms. People are being born to the same class again and again. It is not dignified.\nIf you live totally, once is enough.\nSo Vivek, you did perfectly well with your jealousy. Now the energy is released – because you did not get into jealousy; otherwise that energy would have burned you, wounded you, made you sad, harmed you, and poisoned others – because we are not so separate as we think.\nWe are very deeply connected, and particularly here with me. You become more and more connected with each other. The differences drop, nobody bothers what is your religion, what is your nation, no barrier remains. People come closer and closer. That means they are affected also. If one person gets sick, becomes sad, feels nauseous, then everybody else will be affected in some measure or other. If one is joyous – dancing, singing, playing on his guitar – then everybody else also feels a certain song in his heart.\nAnd I want you to become more and more close, almost like one soul in different bodies. You have been struggling with jealousy for years. Now you have found the key.\nNext time if jealousy comes, immediately catch hold of it; and the same that you have done with enemy number one, you can do with all the enemies that come into your mind. They are smaller enemies, they will disappear even sooner, they don’t have that much energy.\nBut when energy is left then this problem is bound to arise – what to do with this energy. Up to now it was used by, sucked by, jealousy. Now it is all over your body. You feel more sensuous, you feel more loving. And you, up to now, have remained in a rigid way, always keeping yourself a little off from people. It is not your fault; it is the misery of all England! So drop this England too. Just be human.\nAnd don’t wait, because that energy unexpressed can create problems. Express it – dance, sing, love, whatever comes to your mind to do.\nQuestion 1 BELOVED OSHO,\nWHEN AN ARTIST IS ON THE STAGE OR PAINTING, SOMETIMES SUDDENLY THE MIND STOPS AND THERE IS NO ONE ON THE STAGE OR DOING THE PAINTING. AS YOU SAY, THE CREATIVITY PASSES THROUGH THE ARTIST WHILE HE IS A HOLLOW BAMBOO.\nTHEN A BEAUTIFUL WORK OF ART IS DONE BECAUSE NO ONE BUT EXISTENCE HAS DONE IT.\nI WONDER IF IT IS LIKE A GLIMPSE OF ENLIGHTENMENT. BUT IT LASTS THE TIME OF A SOAP BUBBLE. BACK TO NORMAL, THE POOR GUY IS BACK IN THE DESERT OF DAILY LIFE WHICH IS VERY MEDIOCRE, AND HE DOESN’T HAVE THE PASSPORT TO REACH THE REALITY OF HIS GLIMPSES. THE WORK OF ART STAYS AT THIS HEIGHT – IT IS FAR BEYOND THE CREATOR – BUT THE POOR FELLOW STAYS DOWN THERE IN THE VALLEY. SOMETIMES HE CAN RIDE ON ANOTHER SOAP BUBBLE, BUT HE’LL SOON BE BACK IN THE VALLEY.\nMOZART, BEETHOVEN, LEONARDO DA VINCI, VINCENT VAN GOGH, AND MANY OTHERS, BURNT THEMSELVES IN THIS SEARCH, BUT IT SEEMS THEY DIDN’T ARRIVE ANYWHERE. IS IT BECAUSE THEY DIDN’T FIND THE RIGHT MASTER?\nAND ANOTHER QUESTION ARISES: IF EXISTENCE IS GENEROUS ENOUGH AND HAS GIVEN THOSE GUYS ANOTHER CHANCE, ARE THEY AROUND NOW?\nOSHO, WHY DOESN’T THE BOAT OF CREATIVITY HAVE ENOUGH FUEL TO REACH THE SHORE OF ENLIGHTENMENT?\nThe creative people – whether painters, musicians, poets or dancers – reach to a place once in a while that can be called “a glimpse of enlightenment” but it is only a glimpse. It is not a realization. They have not prepared themselves for it. It has come accidentally.\nThe painter was absorbed in painting. He was so absorbed in painting that he forgot himself, forgot the ego, forgot his thoughts, and without knowing it he was in a state of meditation, and accidentally a door opened and he saw the beauty of the beyond.\nBut because he is not prepared, he cannot remain in meditation. He does not even know the ABC of meditation; he may never have heard the word. He was doing something else. It was just because he got lost in his work – in dance, in music, in singing – he fulfilled the condition for a glimpse.\nSoon he will be back – when the dance is over, when the painting is complete, he will be back in the desert of daily life. And he will be worse than the ordinary man because he has known something which the ordinary man has not even dreamt of. His misery is more. He has seen the door open, he has seen the door closed, and he feels utterly helpless.\nNow a great problem has arisen for him, that there is something far more beautiful than any painting, far more musical than any music, far more poetic than any poetry. There is a dance beyond dance, but how to reach there? All that he can manage is his ordinary dance. In his ordinary dance, if he becomes conscious that he’s doing it to get the glimpse back, he will not get the glimpse because the condition will not be fulfilled, he will not be lost in the dance. Technically he will be doing the dance but his ego will remain watching for the window to open; it will not open. It will open only when he forgets himself.\nThe problem is that this situation has been only in the West, not in the East.\nThe East is poor, immensely poor, but in a way tremendously rich. In the East if the poet or the painter or the musician had the glimpse, he would not bother about the dance or the painting, he would look for a master, because it is understood – it is in the atmosphere, and it has been there for thousands of years – that creativity can give you a glimpse but not more than that. If you want something that becomes part and parcel of you, then you have to find a master, a path; you have to change yourself, your ways of living. You have to bring awareness to everything that you do, and you need somebody to tell you – not only to tell you, but somebody whose presence becomes a proof that you are not chasing some shadow, some hallucination.\nThe West is poor. It has created great artists, but unfortunately in the West there has been no atmosphere for enlightenment, no masters who could show you the way. The Western artists have suffered more than anybody else – they have gone mad, they have committed suicide, they have drowned themselves in drugs. The Western artist suffered more than anybody else in the West, because he had a glimpse of the beyond and he could not manage to make that glimpse a reality which remained twenty-four hours with him like the heartbeat. His anguish is tremendous.\nIn the East I have not found the name of any painter, any sculptor, any musician, any poet, who has gone mad, who has committed suicide, who has drowned himself in drugs, for the simple reason that in the very air it was possible to find a master. And if you had a glimpse, you were fortunate because you would know that something exists beyond, you had just to find the bridge to go there, to just be there.\nThe division of East and West has been one of the greatest tragedies. It should be dissolved.\nThe Eastern science of inner being should be brought to each Western seeker or potential seeker or possible seeker.\nAnd Western science and technology should reach to every nook and corner of the East to destroy the poverty, the uneducatedness.\nBoth have something and both are missing something. And this is really amazing, that what the East is missing the West has, and what the West is missing the East has.\nIt is a simple question of understanding, to let there be a meeting of East and West so that the outer poverty disappears from the East and the inner poverty disappears from the West. The whole earth can be rich, rich in both ways. There is no need for choice, no need to choose; both can be ours, and both should be ours. There is no conflict.\nMy whole work is basically this, but neither is the East ready to listen to me nor the West. It seems to be really an insane situation.\nJust the other day Anando was giving me information that millions of tons of butter and other foodstuffs have again accumulated in the European market. And just a few months before they had destroyed so much foodstuff that in destroying it they had to spend four million dollars. And again it has accumulated – the surplus. They cannot stop the farmer because then the farmer will fall economically low, so the farmer has to be helped to go on producing; and the market is already overfull, so every three months they have to destroy food.\nAnd in the East people are dying every day because there is no food.\nThis is strange and stupid, inhuman too – that every three or four months you have to destroy huge mountains of butter and other foodstuff – and by just drowning them in the ocean you waste millions of dollars. Those millions of dollars can be used to transport those things to the poor countries.\nBut they will not do that.\nIn the East there was Shri Raman. He would not come to the West, and I can understand why – because I have come and I have suffered and seen. Many times he was asked, invited, and he refused. He simply said, “I will not be understood; I will be misunderstood. Just leave me alone.”\nAnd now I can understand him. He was right. I have tried my best and the result is a tremendous antagonism. Even in the countries where I have never gone, even in the countries where there is not even a single sannyasin there is so much fear, and absolutely unfounded fear.\nThe man who created all kinds of lies against me has been rewarded; today he has been rewarded by the United States government as a great researcher, investigator; he has been given a gold medal. And whatever he has investigated was absolute lies. But they managed to destroy the commune.\nThe commune could have become a meeting place for East and West. That was my idea.\nBut it seems the East is satisfied with its poverty but will not lose its superstitions – which it has to lose if science and technology are to be introduced. And the West seems to be satisfied with its inner poverty, because if it wants to be inwardly rich it will have to lose all kinds of superstitions that it has been carrying for thousands of years – and it is not willing to do that.\nJust the other day the secretary of the Dutch parliament, answering the questions of journalists, said that I have not been allowed in Holland and I will not be allowed in Holland because I have said something in praise of Adolf Hitler. And the journalist pointed out that I have contradicted it – and it was the German magazine SPIEGEL which had misquoted me. And the secretary accepted\nthat that was true, it was a misrepresentation, but still...”His coming may create a disorder.” And the journalist said that when the pope came there was tremendous protest against him and great disorder, and yet he was allowed, and he was a guest of the government.\nAnd, as far as I am concerned, in no country have I been protested against by the people. There is no precedent for it, it is just their assumption.\nAnd Holland has thousands of sannyasins, the reporter said, who would welcome him.\nAnd I am ready to face those protests. I would really love to see who are those people who want to protest against me, on what grounds.\nAnd I don’t even want government security. I don’t even want them to be responsible if anything happens to me, it is my responsibility.\nBut the fear is somewhere else. All others are excuses. The fear is that I can change the mind of the younger generation. That’s what the American president has sent in a message here to Uruguay, “The man is dangerous for the simple reason that he is extremely intelligent and is capable of changing the minds of the younger people.”\nYou don’t have anybody else to contradict me? There are six hundred fifty million Catholics – you don’t have a single Catholic who can argue against me?\nWhat is the problem? It should be simple and human. I am ready for any public discussion. I am ready to come to all these parliaments who are talking about me. In fact, if they have any guts they should invite me to their parliament – and I am ready to face their whole parliament. But the fear is – they themselves know – they have no future, their death is so certain that they are afraid that I will expose them.\nBut they are not concerned that I am not exposing them in a destructive way. I am exposing your fallacies so that I can substitute the positive, the right dimension which can help the West, its creative people, its intelligent people, to have a transformation.\nIn the West, enlightenment is an unknown factor. There have been great saints like Francis of Assisi – a beautiful man, a very loving man. You cannot find anything wrong in him, but that is not enough; he does not have the experience of the ultimate reality, and that is proved by small incidents. The pope became jealous that Francis was attracting followers and he was not even accepted yet as a saint. He was called to Rome. Now, you cannot call Gautam Buddha like this. And he came, kissed the feet of the pope, who was just an idiot. And he was very happy; he conferred the title of ‘saint’ on Francis of Assisi. He was a good man, but not an enlightened man; otherwise, there would have been a rebellion – he would not have cared a bit about the degree of ‘saint’ given by the pope, and he would not have kissed his feet. He would not have bothered to come to Rome as a servant, having to present himself to the court of the pope. A nice man, a good man – everything is right about him, just there is no light, the room is dark.\nThe West has not known the experience of enlightenment.\nBut I am insistent that we are going to make hundreds of Western people, for the first time in history, enlightened.\nAll these governments and their opposition are not going to stop me. It is not a question of my idea; it is now an existential necessity – that the West must have enlightened people. Only those enlightened people of the West will be able to help the West to be generous towards the poverty of East, only they will be able to create an atmosphere where it is simply inhuman and ugly to go on destroying food when people are dying, just to keep your prices high, so your economy remains the same and does not suffer.\nIt seems economics is more important than love, than compassion; but it is possible only if we can manage – and we will manage.\nMy people are trying to find the place.\nMy other people are trying to find the ships – to create a city in the ocean. And it seems most practical and probable to create a beautiful city of five thousand resident sannyasins, with the capacity of twenty thousand more who will be coming and going. And we can move the city from one place to another place. We can go around the earth.\nThis is how blessings come in disguise. I’m really excited about it!\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"5535","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_transmission_of_the_lamp/part17/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_transmission_of_the_lamp/>The Transmission of the Lamp</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">17 If you live totally, once is enough</h1><div class=post-meta>26 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;5535 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Transmission_of_the_Lamp/part17.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part16>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

MYSELF.</p><p><br></p><p>THE OPPORTUNITY AROSE FOR ME TO LET MYSELF FACE MY NUMBER ONE DEVIL:
JEALOUSY. I WENT FOR IT WHOLEHEARTEDLY, AND THE RESULT WAS TO SEND
MYSELF EVEN HIGHER: I FELT EUPHORIC AND SO GRATEFUL.</p><p><br></p><p>I AM STILL LEFT WITH AN ALMOST UNCONTAINABLE ENERGY WHICH SEEMS
COMPOSED OF SENSUALITY AND OF LOVINGNESS.</p><p><br></p><p>IF I GO INTO IT, I RISK HURTING OTHER PEOPLE; BUT THE ALTERNATIVE
SEEMS A COMPROMISE. SITTING AND WATCHING IT DRIVES ME BANANAS!</p><p><br></p><p>OSHO, MY MAIN QUESTION IS: WHAT IS IT THAT I HAVE LEARNED FROM THIS
EXPERIENCE, AND HOW TO USE THIS SO AS NOT TO BE TAKEN OVER AGAIN BY
JEALOUSY? HOW TO ENJOY THE FREEDOM TO EXPRESS SENSUALITY WITHOUT
COMPROMISING, GETTING FRUSTRATED OR SLIPPING ON THE BANANA?</p><p><br></p><p>Vivek, it has been a very meaningful experience for you, one of the
key experiences which can help one to change one’s energy totally.</p><p>George Gurdjieff used to find the first thing in his disciples – the
characteristic that was their number one enemy because their number one
enemy contains the key which either can destroy them if they don’t
understand it or can bring a transformation.</p><p><br></p><p>You faced jealousy. Jealousy is one of the most dangerous elements in
human consciousness, particularly in the female mind. To face your
number one enemy without hiding it, without whitewashing it, without
trying to interpret it favorably – that you are right, the situation is
such that of course you have to be jealous – without in any way
satisfying yourself by explanations that the jealousy was right.</p><p><br></p><p>If you satisfy yourself that it is right, it is going to remain and
it will become more powerful; then the energy that you are feeling now,
you would not feel, this energy would have been absorbed by jealousy, it
would have remained contained in jealousy, and would have remained
looking for a moment when it could explode – to find some excuse. But
because you faced it without bringing any explanation to explain it
away... you did not justify it, you simply faced it as a fact, that you
have this jealousy... and you accepted it, that it has something to do
with you, not with anyone else, that nobody else in the whole world is
responsible for it.</p><p><br></p><p>All those are excuses to protect it.</p><p><br></p><p>You did a good job, and the result is that just being watchful the
jealousy disappeared.</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s what I have been telling you continually for years, that
nothing has to be done; simply face a problem the way a mirror reflects
something, with no judgment.</p><p><br></p><p>And because it was your number one enemy, it contained a lot of
energy. Now it is gone, and the energy is free. That’s why you are
feeling more alive, more loving, more sensuous.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember one thing: again you can commit the same mistake. Don’t
condemn sensuality. It has been condemned by the whole world, and
because of their condemnation the energy that can flower in sensuality
moves into perversions, jealousy, anger, hatred – a kind of life which
is dry, with no juice. Sensuousness is your very life. That is the
difference between you and a stone – because the stone is not sensuous.
The more sensuous you are, you more alive you are. And if your whole
energy is released in loving, in being playfully sensuous without
holding yourself back, without any fear – there is nothing to be afraid
of. Sensuousness is one of the greatest blessings to humanity; it is
your sensitivity, it is your consciousness; consciousness filtering
through the body is what sensuousness is.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember never to compromise. Compromise is absolutely against my
whole vision.</p><p><br></p><p>You see the people. They are miserable because they have compromised
on every point, and they cannot forgive themselves because they have
compromised. They know that they could have dared, but they proved
cowards. In their own eyes they have fallen, they have lost
self-respect; that’s what compromise does.</p><p><br></p><p>Why should one compromise? What have we got to lose? In this small
life, live as totally as possible. Don’t be afraid of going to the
extreme, you cannot go more than total, that is the last line; and
don’t</p><p>compromise. Your whole mind will go for compromise because that’s how
we have been brought up, conditioned.</p><p><br></p><p>Compromise is one of the most ugly words in our language. It means,
“I give half, you give half; I settle for half, you settle for half.”
But why? When you can have the whole, when you can eat the cake and have
it too, then why compromise?</p><p><br></p><p>Just a little courage, just a little daring – and only in the
beginning. Once you have experienced the beauty of non-compromising and
the dignity that it brings, and the joy, and the integrity, and the
individuality, for the first time you feel that you have roots, that you
have a center, that you live out of your own, you don’t live like a
businessman – living life like a businessman is prostitution.</p><p><br></p><p>Live like a warrior.</p><p><br></p><p>This way or that, but never compromising. It is better to be
defeated, but totally, than to be victorious through a compromise; that
victory will not give you anything except humiliation, and the defeat
without compromise will still give you dignity.</p><p><br></p><p>Life is mysterious.</p><p><br></p><p>Here sometimes victory is just shameful and defeat is a dignity
because one would not compromise.</p><p><br></p><p>So whatever sensuality you feel, whatever love you feel, just don’t
keep them in your mind; otherwise, they get sour, they get bitter.
Express them.</p><p><br></p><p>And remember one thing, that expression is always a tremendous
release of your own energy; otherwise, your energy goes on accumulating
and becomes a burden. And when it becomes a burden, you start throwing
the responsibility on other people because you are sad, you are heavy,
somebody must be doing something wrong. If you are sad, you are wrong;
if you are joyful, you are right.</p><p><br></p><p>It has been almost a criterion to me that anybody who is sad,
complaining, grumpy, is wrong, is bound to be wrong. He may find a
thousand and one reasons why he is sad. I don’t accept it. He is sad
because he has not allowed his life to blossom. He has been holding
back. Even when people want to love each other, they are holding back –
because all the religions have poisoned love. They have not been able to
destroy it, but they have succeeded in poisoning it.</p><p><br></p><p>And sensuality is so much condemned, and if you condemn sensuality
then what is to remain? Then man remains like a marble statue – you
touch his hand and you feel like you are shaking hands with a dead
branch. All his energy has shrunken in himself – rather than blossoming
in flowers, it has become complexes within himself which are making him
sad.</p><p><br></p><p>At least my people should never think of compromise. Compromise for
what? Be true. Be honest. Be sincere. Love as much as you can. Enjoy
your sensuality – it is a gift of nature. And be watchful, because what
you are enjoying is everybody else’s right too. Otherwise there will be
conflict. Because of that conflict people compromise.</p><p>If you enjoy intense living, you should appreciate everybody who is
living intensely. With whom he is living does not matter – because we
are all one life, one life force.</p><p><br></p><p>All the traditions have been against expressiveness because a person
who is expressive attains a certain kind of solidity, a freedom. You
cannot enslave him. He lives according to his own nature. You cannot
force him. You cannot make him a husband or a wife. That’s why the
society has tried hard to repress, because the repressed person is so
much reduced – he’s almost like the castrated bull.</p><p><br></p><p>You cannot use a bull in a bullock cart. The bull is too powerful. He
can take your bullock cart and you anywhere, where you never wanted to
go. You cannot control him. And if he comes across a beautiful female,
he will simply jump out of your bullock cart. What happens to you and
your bullock cart, that is your business. He will start a love affair
immediately, not bothering at all that you are under the bullock cart,
the bullock cart is upside down.</p><p><br></p><p>Man must have learned very early that bulls cannot be used, they are
useless.</p><p><br></p><p>But they found the idea of why they are useless, because they are so
full of energy, and so sensuous, and so loving.</p><p><br></p><p>People started castrating them, and once a bull is castrated you have
reduced him to a totally different being that he was not destined to be.
Now you can use him in a bullock cart. You can enslave him. You can use
him in farms, and wherever you want. You have destroyed his possibility
of regenerative forces. You have done a crime against nature. Now the
cow may be passing by his side, he will not even look at her, he doesn’t
have energy.</p><p><br></p><p>In my childhood when I saw the farmers castrating the bulls, I
inquired what is the matter. My father said, “When you are old enough
you will understand.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I don’t want to wait. I want to understand now, why these
poor creatures are being tortured.” He said, “You just wait.”</p><p>And when I understood, I told him that, “You have not only been doing
that to bulls, you have been doing that to human beings too – in a
different way, not physiologically but psychologically.”</p><p><br></p><p>All the religions are castrating human beings. For example, all over
the world ladies are told that while making love they should not show
any sign of joy. What nonsense. Even while making love they are not
allowed to show any signs of joy because that is what prostitutes do,
not ladies – and this is compromise. Being ladies they compromised. So
when the man is making love to them, they are lying down with closed
eyes, because even to open their eyes is not right for a lady – to see
such an ugly scene, that the beast on top of them is doing push-ups. It
is not lady-like. It is better to keep your eyes closed. And don’t
move.</p><p><br></p><p>For thousands of years women had no knowledge of orgasm – and even
today in the East, almost ninety-nine percent of women don’t know what
orgasm is. And the same was the story all over the world because they
never moved, they never enjoyed, they never allowed their body to
dance.</p><p>There is a difference between man’s and woman’s sexuality. Man’s sex
is local, it is genital. Woman’s sexuality is more sensuality than
sexuality, it is all over her body. Unless her whole body participates,
she will not experience the orgasmic joy – which is the greatest gift
nature has given.</p><p>And it is really shocking and surprising, that because man destroyed
the woman, because she was not allowed to enjoy lovingness, he himself
was alone making the push-ups. There was no other.</p><p>I have heard of a drunkard who was walking on the beach... and then
he saw a man doing push-ups. The drunkard looked down, looked from this
side and that side, went around, tapped the man, and said, “Boy, your
girl is gone. Why are you unnecessarily tiring your body? Go home.”</p><p>But this is really the situation, and the by-product is that these
same so-called gentlemen who produced this ugly situation – that they
made their own wives non-sensuous, dry – created many things because
these women became angry, nagging, fighting. These were just perversions
of the energy that could have become flowers, fragrance. And on the
other hand, these gentlemen had to go to prostitutes; they created
prostitutes – which was another ugliness. To force women just for money,
to sell their bodies – because with their own wives they themselves
could not get the orgasm. Ejaculation is not orgasm. They could produce
children but they could not produce orgasm.</p><p>Orgasm needs both the partners in a sensuous dance.</p><p><br></p><p>To create the ladies, they had to reduce other poor women into
prostitutes. It is such an ugly society, so nauseating, if you look into
its structure and the way it has behaved and destroyed man.</p><p>At least my people should be totally free. They should love. And
there is no lady here, and there is no gentleman here; here are only men
and women, real men and real women.</p><p>And be sensuous. Enjoy life to its fullest, and help others also to
enjoy the life to its fullest. And you will find, strangely, that
because of your love, your sensuousness, all your ugly traits have
disappeared because they no more get any energy – they were perversions,
they were by-products of your compromises. No compromise for any reason
– respectability, honor, all are nonsense.</p><p>How many million people have lived before you? And do you remember a
few names who were very respectable, very honorable, and they had
sacrificed their whole life for their honor and their respectability,
and now even their names?... Nobody knows whether they ever happened or
not.</p><p>In Jaina mythology there is a very beautiful story. I have loved it
very much. In Jaina mythology if a king conquers the whole world he’s
called the chakravartin. chakra means wheel, as if the world is a wheel
– it is a wheel – and he has conquered it completely. And the mythology
is that in heaven only chakravartins are allowed to make their
signatures on a golden mountain.</p><p>One man became a chakravartin, and he was very happy that now he will
be able to write his name on the golden mountain. Very few people – once
in a while – have been able to write their names. The mountain is
enormous. As he died and entered the gates of heaven, the doorkeeper
said, “You have to sign your signature on the golden mountain, but go
alone. Don’t take anybody with you.”</p><p>He said, “Why? I would like a few of my friends who have died before
me and who must be here to be with me; otherwise, what is the joy of
signing on the golden mountain? Nobody is watching you, nobody will ever
know that you have signed there.”</p><p>The doorkeeper said, “Listen to me. I have been on this post...
before me was my father, and this is our heritage. For centuries our
family has kept this post. And to everybody who has gone to sign, this
was suggested; and everybody wanted the same that you are wanting. And
afterwards, everybody thanked us, ‘It was so kind of you to have
prevented me from taking anybody.’ So please go alone.”</p><p>Reluctantly he went in, and the mountain keeper opened the doors and
said, “There is a difficulty. The mountain is full of names. There is no
space. And this is not only with you; before me my father was here,
before him his father was here. This is our family post. And I have
heard that since centuries this has been the case, that the mountain is
full. So every time a new person comes, first you have to erase one name
and then sign your name. There is no other way; there is no space.”</p><p>Then he recognized that it is good that he has not brought his
friends to see. A great mountain and there is not even a small space for
his signature.</p><p>But he was – he must have been – a man of understanding. He said, “I
will not erase, because what is the point? Somebody will come tomorrow
and erase my name and will sign his. This is all futile. So my being
chakravartin, a world conqueror, is useless and I was thinking that it
happens only once in a while. I was wrong. This whole mountain is full
of signatures.”</p><p>Just a small life you have. Don’t bother about any respectability,
don’t bother about any honor, don’t bother about what others will say.
Simply listen to your own energy and follow it. I call it courage. Be
sensuous, be loving, and if you can be totally loving and sensuous there
is a possibility one day to transcend, to come to a point of awareness
where all your energy turns into just a flame of awareness – all your
sensuality, all your sexuality, all your love, everything in you – turns
into a flame that has been called enlightenment, awakening; a flame that
remains forever in the universe without taking another form again,
because it has used the whole potential of forms. People are being born
to the same class again and again. It is not dignified.</p><p>If you live totally, once is enough.</p><p><br></p><p>So Vivek, you did perfectly well with your jealousy. Now the energy
is released – because you did not get into jealousy; otherwise that
energy would have burned you, wounded you, made you sad, harmed you, and
poisoned others – because we are not so separate as we think.</p><p>We are very deeply connected, and particularly here with me. You
become more and more connected with each other. The differences drop,
nobody bothers what is your religion, what is your nation, no barrier
remains. People come closer and closer. That means they are affected
also. If one person gets sick, becomes sad, feels nauseous, then
everybody else will be affected in some measure or other. If one is
joyous – dancing, singing, playing on his guitar – then everybody else
also feels a certain song in his heart.</p><p>And I want you to become more and more close, almost like one soul in
different bodies. You have been struggling with jealousy for years. Now
you have found the key.</p><p>Next time if jealousy comes, immediately catch hold of it; and the
same that you have done with enemy number one, you can do with all the
enemies that come into your mind. They are smaller enemies, they will
disappear even sooner, they don’t have that much energy.</p><p>But when energy is left then this problem is bound to arise – what to
do with this energy. Up to now it was used by, sucked by, jealousy. Now
it is all over your body. You feel more sensuous, you feel more loving.
And you, up to now, have remained in a rigid way, always keeping
yourself a little off from people. It is not your fault; it is the
misery of all England! So drop this England too. Just be human.</p><p><br></p><p>And don’t wait, because that energy unexpressed can create problems.
Express it – dance, sing, love, whatever comes to your mind to do.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>WHEN AN ARTIST IS ON THE STAGE OR PAINTING, SOMETIMES SUDDENLY THE
MIND STOPS AND THERE IS NO ONE ON THE STAGE OR DOING THE PAINTING. AS
YOU SAY, THE CREATIVITY PASSES THROUGH THE ARTIST WHILE HE IS A HOLLOW
BAMBOO.</p><p><br></p><p>THEN A BEAUTIFUL WORK OF ART IS DONE BECAUSE NO ONE BUT EXISTENCE HAS
DONE IT.</p><p><br></p><p>I WONDER IF IT IS LIKE A GLIMPSE OF ENLIGHTENMENT. BUT IT LASTS THE
TIME OF A SOAP BUBBLE. BACK TO NORMAL, THE POOR GUY IS BACK IN THE
DESERT OF DAILY LIFE WHICH IS VERY MEDIOCRE, AND HE DOESN’T HAVE THE
PASSPORT TO REACH THE REALITY OF HIS GLIMPSES. THE WORK OF ART STAYS AT
THIS HEIGHT – IT IS FAR BEYOND THE CREATOR – BUT THE POOR FELLOW STAYS
DOWN THERE IN THE VALLEY. SOMETIMES HE CAN RIDE ON ANOTHER SOAP BUBBLE,
BUT HE’LL SOON BE BACK IN THE VALLEY.</p><p><br></p><p>MOZART, BEETHOVEN, LEONARDO DA VINCI, VINCENT VAN GOGH, AND MANY
OTHERS, BURNT THEMSELVES IN THIS SEARCH, BUT IT SEEMS THEY DIDN’T ARRIVE
ANYWHERE. IS IT BECAUSE THEY DIDN’T FIND THE RIGHT MASTER?</p><p><br></p><p>AND ANOTHER QUESTION ARISES: IF EXISTENCE IS GENEROUS ENOUGH AND HAS
GIVEN THOSE GUYS ANOTHER CHANCE, ARE THEY AROUND NOW?</p><p><br></p><p>OSHO, WHY DOESN’T THE BOAT OF CREATIVITY HAVE ENOUGH FUEL TO REACH
THE SHORE OF ENLIGHTENMENT?</p><p><br></p><p>The creative people – whether painters, musicians, poets or dancers –
reach to a place once in a while that can be called “a glimpse of
enlightenment” but it is only a glimpse. It is not a realization. They
have not prepared themselves for it. It has come accidentally.</p><p><br></p><p>The painter was absorbed in painting. He was so absorbed in painting
that he forgot himself, forgot the ego, forgot his thoughts, and without
knowing it he was in a state of meditation, and accidentally a door
opened and he saw the beauty of the beyond.</p><p><br></p><p>But because he is not prepared, he cannot remain in meditation. He
does not even know the ABC of meditation; he may never have heard the
word. He was doing something else. It was just because he got lost in
his work – in dance, in music, in singing – he fulfilled the condition
for a glimpse.</p><p>Soon he will be back – when the dance is over, when the painting is
complete, he will be back in the desert of daily life. And he will be
worse than the ordinary man because he has known something which the
ordinary man has not even dreamt of. His misery is more. He has seen the
door open, he has seen the door closed, and he feels utterly
helpless.</p><p><br></p><p>Now a great problem has arisen for him, that there is something far
more beautiful than any painting, far more musical than any music, far
more poetic than any poetry. There is a dance beyond dance, but how to
reach there? All that he can manage is his ordinary dance. In his
ordinary dance, if he becomes conscious that he’s doing it to get the
glimpse back, he will not get the glimpse because the condition will not
be fulfilled, he will not be lost in the dance. Technically he will be
doing the dance but his ego will remain watching for the window to open;
it will not open. It will open only when he forgets himself.</p><p><br></p><p>The problem is that this situation has been only in the West, not in
the East.</p><p><br></p><p>The East is poor, immensely poor, but in a way tremendously rich. In
the East if the poet or the painter or the musician had the glimpse, he
would not bother about the dance or the painting, he would look for a
master, because it is understood – it is in the atmosphere, and it has
been there for thousands of years – that creativity can give you a
glimpse but not more than that. If you want something that becomes part
and parcel of you, then you have to find a master, a path; you have to
change yourself, your ways of living. You have to bring awareness to
everything that you do, and you need somebody to tell you – not only to
tell you, but somebody whose presence becomes a proof that you are not
chasing some shadow, some hallucination.</p><p><br></p><p>The West is poor. It has created great artists, but unfortunately in
the West there has been no atmosphere for enlightenment, no masters who
could show you the way. The Western artists have suffered more than
anybody else – they have gone mad, they have committed suicide, they
have drowned themselves in drugs. The Western artist suffered more than
anybody else in the West, because he had a glimpse of the beyond and he
could not manage to make that glimpse a reality which remained
twenty-four hours with him like the heartbeat. His anguish is
tremendous.</p><p><br></p><p>In the East I have not found the name of any painter, any sculptor,
any musician, any poet, who has gone mad, who has committed suicide, who
has drowned himself in drugs, for the simple reason that in the very air
it was possible to find a master. And if you had a glimpse, you were
fortunate because you would know that something exists beyond, you had
just to find the bridge to go there, to just be there.</p><p><br></p><p>The division of East and West has been one of the greatest tragedies.
It should be dissolved.</p><p><br></p><p>The Eastern science of inner being should be brought to each Western
seeker or potential seeker or possible seeker.</p><p><br></p><p>And Western science and technology should reach to every nook and
corner of the East to destroy the poverty, the uneducatedness.</p><p><br></p><p>Both have something and both are missing something. And this is
really amazing, that what the East is missing the West has, and what the
West is missing the East has.</p><p>It is a simple question of understanding, to let there be a meeting
of East and West so that the outer poverty disappears from the East and
the inner poverty disappears from the West. The whole earth can be rich,
rich in both ways. There is no need for choice, no need to choose; both
can be ours, and both should be ours. There is no conflict.</p><p><br></p><p>My whole work is basically this, but neither is the East ready to
listen to me nor the West. It seems to be really an insane
situation.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the other day Anando was giving me information that millions of
tons of butter and other foodstuffs have again accumulated in the
European market. And just a few months before they had destroyed so much
foodstuff that in destroying it they had to spend four million dollars.
And again it has accumulated – the surplus. They cannot stop the farmer
because then the farmer will fall economically low, so the farmer has to
be helped to go on producing; and the market is already overfull, so
every three months they have to destroy food.</p><p><br></p><p>And in the East people are dying every day because there is no
food.</p><p><br></p><p>This is strange and stupid, inhuman too – that every three or four
months you have to destroy huge mountains of butter and other foodstuff
– and by just drowning them in the ocean you waste millions of dollars.
Those millions of dollars can be used to transport those things to the
poor countries.</p><p><br></p><p>But they will not do that.</p><p><br></p><p>In the East there was Shri Raman. He would not come to the West, and
I can understand why – because I have come and I have suffered and seen.
Many times he was asked, invited, and he refused. He simply said, “I
will not be understood; I will be misunderstood. Just leave me
alone.”</p><p><br></p><p>And now I can understand him. He was right. I have tried my best and
the result is a tremendous antagonism. Even in the countries where I
have never gone, even in the countries where there is not even a single
sannyasin there is so much fear, and absolutely unfounded fear.</p><p><br></p><p>The man who created all kinds of lies against me has been rewarded;
today he has been rewarded by the United States government as a great
researcher, investigator; he has been given a gold medal. And whatever
he has investigated was absolute lies. But they managed to destroy the
commune.</p><p><br></p><p>The commune could have become a meeting place for East and West. That
was my idea.</p><p><br></p><p>But it seems the East is satisfied with its poverty but will not lose
its superstitions – which it has to lose if science and technology are
to be introduced. And the West seems to be satisfied with its inner
poverty, because if it wants to be inwardly rich it will have to lose
all kinds of superstitions that it has been carrying for thousands of
years – and it is not willing to do that.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the other day the secretary of the Dutch parliament, answering
the questions of journalists, said that I have not been allowed in
Holland and I will not be allowed in Holland because I have said
something in praise of Adolf Hitler. And the journalist pointed out that
I have contradicted it – and it was the German magazine SPIEGEL which
had misquoted me. And the secretary accepted</p><p>that that was true, it was a misrepresentation, but still...”His
coming may create a disorder.” And the journalist said that when the
pope came there was tremendous protest against him and great disorder,
and yet he was allowed, and he was a guest of the government.</p><p><br></p><p>And, as far as I am concerned, in no country have I been protested
against by the people. There is no precedent for it, it is just their
assumption.</p><p><br></p><p>And Holland has thousands of sannyasins, the reporter said, who would
welcome him.</p><p><br></p><p>And I am ready to face those protests. I would really love to see who
are those people who want to protest against me, on what grounds.</p><p><br></p><p>And I don’t even want government security. I don’t even want them to
be responsible if anything happens to me, it is my responsibility.</p><p><br></p><p>But the fear is somewhere else. All others are excuses. The fear is
that I can change the mind of the younger generation. That’s what the
American president has sent in a message here to Uruguay, “The man is
dangerous for the simple reason that he is extremely intelligent and is
capable of changing the minds of the younger people.”</p><p><br></p><p>You don’t have anybody else to contradict me? There are six hundred
fifty million Catholics – you don’t have a single Catholic who can argue
against me?</p><p><br></p><p>What is the problem? It should be simple and human. I am ready for
any public discussion. I am ready to come to all these parliaments who
are talking about me. In fact, if they have any guts they should invite
me to their parliament – and I am ready to face their whole parliament.
But the fear is – they themselves know – they have no future, their
death is so certain that they are afraid that I will expose them.</p><p><br></p><p>But they are not concerned that I am not exposing them in a
destructive way. I am exposing your fallacies so that I can substitute
the positive, the right dimension which can help the West, its creative
people, its intelligent people, to have a transformation.</p><p><br></p><p>In the West, enlightenment is an unknown factor. There have been
great saints like Francis of Assisi – a beautiful man, a very loving
man. You cannot find anything wrong in him, but that is not enough; he
does not have the experience of the ultimate reality, and that is proved
by small incidents. The pope became jealous that Francis was attracting
followers and he was not even accepted yet as a saint. He was called to
Rome. Now, you cannot call Gautam Buddha like this. And he came, kissed
the feet of the pope, who was just an idiot. And he was very happy; he
conferred the title of ‘saint’ on Francis of Assisi. He was a good man,
but not an enlightened man; otherwise, there would have been a rebellion
– he would not have cared a bit about the degree of ‘saint’ given by the
pope, and he would not have kissed his feet. He would not have bothered
to come to Rome as a servant, having to present himself to the court of
the pope. A nice man, a good man – everything is right about him, just
there is no light, the room is dark.</p><p><br></p><p>The West has not known the experience of enlightenment.</p><p>But I am insistent that we are going to make hundreds of Western
people, for the first time in history, enlightened.</p><p><br></p><p>All these governments and their opposition are not going to stop me.
It is not a question of my idea; it is now an existential necessity –
that the West must have enlightened people. Only those enlightened
people of the West will be able to help the West to be generous towards
the poverty of East, only they will be able to create an atmosphere
where it is simply inhuman and ugly to go on destroying food when people
are dying, just to keep your prices high, so your economy remains the
same and does not suffer.</p><p><br></p><p>It seems economics is more important than love, than compassion; but
it is possible only if we can manage – and we will manage.</p><p><br></p><p>My people are trying to find the place.</p><p><br></p><p>My other people are trying to find the ships – to create a city in
the ocean. And it seems most practical and probable to create a
beautiful city of five thousand resident sannyasins, with the capacity
of twenty thousand more who will be coming and going. And we can move
the city from one place to another place. We can go around the
earth.</p><p><br></p><p>This is how blessings come in disguise. I’m really excited about
it!</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part16>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

IT SEEMS PROBABLE THAT ABOUT FIVE TO EIGHT MILLION YEARS AGO THE CHIMP-HUMAN ANCESTRAL LINE SPLIT INTO WHAT WAS TO BECOME MODERN CHIMP AND MODERN MAN. Homo Erectus APPEARED ABOUT A MILLION OR SO YEARS AGO.\nTHE INTEREST IN ALL THIS IS THAT IF TRUE, IT MEANS THAT MAN LEARNED TO STAND UP VERY FAST IN EVOLUTIONARY TERMS – OVER ONLY ABOUT A MILLION YEARS. ELSEWHERE, IN TRYING TO EXPLAIN MISSING FOSSILS IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT EVOLUTION IS NOT NECESSARILY SLOW, BUT MAY OCCUR IN SUDDEN LEAPS.\nWHEN I THINK OF AN IMAGINARY CONVERSATION BETWEEN PRE-CHIMP AND PRE-HUMAN, AS THEY PARTED COMPANY SO LONG AGO, I THINK OF YOU TALKING TO MANKIND.\nARE WE LIVING THROUGH AN EQUALLY MOMENTOUS POINT IN EVOLUTION, WHERE YOU, AS THE FIRST OF Homo Novus POINT TO A BEAUTIFUL VISION WHICH IS AS FAR REMOVED FROM Homo Sapiens AS HE, IN TURN, IS FROM THE CHIMPANZEE? MIGHT THE JUMP INTO ENLIGHTENMENT AS A QUANTUM LEAP IN CONSCIOUSNESS HAVE ANY NATURAL EQUIVALENT IN EVOLUTIONARY JUMPS IN THE PHYSICAL WORLD?\nThe quantum leap is the latest discovery in modern physics. Up to now evolution was always thought of as a slow process. Hence it was always contrasted with revolution. Revolution was fast, quick; evolution was very slow.\nBut a quantum leap cannot even be called fast. It is instantaneous: from one point, from one stage, you disappear, and you appear at a higher, at a different point, at a different stage.\nIt was very puzzling in the beginning because no such thing had ever been conceived of. But slowly, slowly physics has settled with it, that it is a reality. Electrons disappear from one point and appear at another point and between the two there is no time gap. Here it disappears, there it appears; the distance is covered but time is not taken in covering the distance.\nIn physics it has now become accepted; in metaphysics, as far as human consciousness is concerned, it can be even quicker, because if matter can take such jumps that it moves almost beyond imagination, beyond the speed of time, in consciousness many more miracles are possible, because of course consciousness is the highest flowering of existence. It seems that the whole existence has been working to reach to the stage of a Gautam Buddha. Gautam Buddha followed slowly the path of evolution, because that was the only possibility in those days.\nAfter twenty-five centuries, it is possible to declare that quantum leaps are available, for those who have the courage, in the field of consciousness too. Particularly in consciousness, time has no reference, no relevance – consciousness in non-temporal.\nOne can move from sleep to awakening instantly – or do you think it takes a long slow process – that first one is partly awake, then a little more awake, and by the evening one is fully awake? And then the second process starts – you start partly asleep, then more, then more, then by midnight you are fast asleep?\nWe know that it happens to everybody that you wake up instantly. Any device may do – just an alarm clock, which has nothing to do with you. The alarm clock is not even aware of you, is not concerned with you – it may be enough to change you from deep sleep into a quick awakening. The same is possible as far as spiritual sleep is concerned. It is only a question of finding a device. The problem is a little complicated, because an alarm clock will do for everybody, but spiritual devices are meant for unique individuals. One device will not work for all, because people are so different, so unique. Nature does not produce carbon copies, everybody is original. Hence he needs an original device.\nIn the past, one hundred and twelve methods have been found for meditation – those are the devices. The undercurrent is the same, just the devices are a little different from each other, because individuals are different from each other.\nThe religions which have been teaching the same prayer to everybody are doing an enormous harm, because that prayer in the first place is based on a belief in a God no one has seen, no one has heard of. Different religions define God in a different way.\nIn England there is now a growing movement of satanism, devil worshippers. Thirty thousand people already openly declare that the devil is not God’s enemy, but God’s only begotten son. And they worship the devil because God, after creating the world, has either gone senile or has completely\nforgotten about the world. But one thing is certain, that he is no more interested, because after those six days, he has never been seen. There is not a single eyewitness. So why bother the old fellow? His young son, the devil... the word ‘devil’ helps them, because it comes from the same Sanskrit root as ‘divine’. It means ‘godly’.\nIt depends on you what you make of God, and such things. Nobody interferes. God has never said anything about himself. He has never said to any religion “Don’t say these things, they are not true.” In fact God is only an image created by man, so is the devil.\nYou can change your images, and you can go on praying to your own handmade, homemade gods for millions of years. Nothing will happen to you, because these are not devices.\nI have told you Leo Tolstoy’s story. Before the Russian revolution, Russia was one of the most orthodox Christian countries, more than anywhere else. The archbishop of the Russian church was getting more and more angry about three men who lived beyond a lake, under a tree – poor folks, villagers, uneducated, uncultured; but people had started worshipping them as saints.\nAnd thousands of people were going there. And that was hurting him very much. These were the people who were supposed to come to his church; they are going to three persons who are not even recognized by the church as saints.\nThe English word ‘saint’ is ugly. It comes from the original ‘sanction’ – a man who has been sanctioned by the church in his holiness. He has a certificate of holiness from the church.\nThese people have never been sanctioned in any holiness, and thousands of people are going. Finally, outraged, he himself went in a boat.\nThose three poor fellows were sitting under a tree, very happy, very peaceful, very silent. But the archbishop was very angry. He screamed at them, shouted at them. They all kneeled before him and said, “Forgive us if we have done anything wrong, but why are you shouting? What is the problem?”\nThe archbishop said, “Who told you you are saints?”\nThey said, “Nobody, and we don’t think we are saints, we are poor people. But what can we do if people have started coming to us, just as you have come. What can we do?”\n“But why have people started coming to you? What is your religion?”\nThey looked at each other. They said, “We are uneducated people; don’t talk in such cultured, sophisticated language. Make it simple.”\nThe archbishop was happy that they were humbled by him. He said, “What prayer do you do?” All the three giggled. He said, “What is there to giggle about; is this your prayer?”\nThey said, “No, this is not, but what it is creates giggling.” “Say it.”\nEverybody said to the other, “You say it.” The second said to the third, “Better you say it. You are older than us. It is your right to say it.”\nThe archbishop said, “I don’t have much time. Say it! What is your prayer?”\nThey said, “We are ashamed. Just forgive us, because our prayer is very poor. Hearing that God is a trinity and we are also a trinity, we have made our own prayer. Our prayer is simple because we are very simple people. We cannot remember long words and big prayers. Our prayer is, ‘You are three, we are three; have mercy on us.’”\nEven the archbishop giggled. He said, “This is a prayer? You were right that it brings giggling. I have never giggled in my life, I am a serious man, but seeing you three fools creating a prayer on your own – and we have a prayer authorized by the church. I will tell you the authorized prayer, and from today, you start the authorized prayer. Become real Christians!”\nThey said, “We will try. Just tell us what we have to do.” So he repeated the whole authorized Russian prayer. As he was saying the prayer, all the three were becoming very sad. At the end, they said, “It is almost impossible for us to remember. You will have to repeat it two, three times so that we can manage. One part I will remember, another part the other remembers, the third part, the third remembers. But the whole prayer to be remembered by one single person is asking too much.”\nHe said, “Okay, that will do, but at least it will be authorized prayer, the right prayer, the only right prayer in the world.” So he repeated again.\nThey thanked him; “It was great of you to come here. God must have sent you here.”\nAnd he went very happily back in his boat, feeling satisfied that now this foolishness will stop. People will not go to these people. I will expose them, that this is their prayer. And how have they become saints?\nBut in the middle of the lake, he saw suddenly all three running on water towards him. He said, “My God!”\nThey caught the boat and said, “One more time because we forgot. We forgot which part is to be remembered by whom. And there was so much conflict that we said it is better to go to you. You can decide which part – and the reality is, we have forgotten the prayer. You repeat it once more.”\nBut now it was a revelation to the archbishop, that these people are walking on water. He said, “Forget the prayer I have told you. Your prayer is right. You continue your prayer, because I have been praying this authorized prayer my whole life. I cannot walk on water. My prayer has not been heard, but your prayer has been heard. You go. Just forgive me for interfering in your life. Whatever you are doing is right. Continue doing it in your own way.”\nThese one hundred and twelve methods of meditation are exhaustive. There cannot be one hundred and thirteen. Everything that different human types will need is included in one hundred and twelve methods. And they are handed down from centuries. They are simple. The key in all those one hundred and twelve methods is witnessing – in different forms, in different strategies – but the\ninnermost core is witnessing, awareness, watchfulness. You can call it anything, but it will be another meaning of witnessing.\nWith witnessing, you can have a quantum leap. You can move from your sleep – not the ordinary, but the spiritual sleep – and you can wake up. Not the ordinary waking that you have done every morning, but the real awakening, which brings you to the highest realization in life – of yourself, and the whole, and that you are part of it; that the whole is you and that you are the whole. There is no distinction.\nPhysics has given the words ‘quantum leap’. No spiritual thinker, philosopher, has tried to think of a parallel for spiritual growth. That shows the poverty of your so-called spiritual thinkers, theologians. But in fact, meditation is the way which can bring a sudden flare-up in your being. And not only that, it can start a chain reaction. One flares up and suddenly people of the same type, who have not even tried meditation, who are not even seekers, who have never thought about anything spiritual, catch the infection – it is contagious.\nSo a few people around the earth get the quantum leap, then thousands more will become part of a world-wide fire. And that is the only way to save whatever millions of years of evolution has brought to us.\nYou have to choose between Ronald Reagan and Gautam Buddha. It is not a coincidence that Ronald Reagan used to have a chimpanzee as his friend. A man is known by the company he keeps. And when he became president, the chimpanzee was also very happy.\nThey both went for a walk. An old man saw the chimpanzee and Ronald Reagan; he was ashamed that the president of America cannot find friendship with any human being, he has to find friendship with a chimpanzee.\nHe went close to them and said, “Mr. President, this does not look good.” Ronald Reagan said, “What does not look good?”\nThat old man said, “You shut up, idiot. I am talking to the president. You have no right to interfere. You may be his friend, not mine.”\nThe future is in danger if man does not understand the methods that can bring him quick transformation. We don’t have time for evolution. We don’t have time even for revolution. Only a quantum leap can save humanity and the universe.\nAnd I think as the pressure of death, destructiveness, nuclear war, becomes more and more heavy, the quantum leap will also become more and more possible, because it will be the only way out of a global suicide.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nWHEN WE START WATCHING OUR BODIES, AND THEN OUR MINDS AND EMOTIONS, THERE REMAINS AN ELEMENT, ALTHOUGH SUBTLE, OF CONCENTRATION. INITIALLY, FOR EXAMPLE, WATCHING MY BREATHING, I WOULD WATCH IT TO THE EXCLUSION OF EVERYTHING ELSE – HERE THERE WAS AN ELEMENT OF FOCUS. ON OTHER OCCASIONS, WHEN SILENCE IS JUST THERE, THE BREATHING MAY BE ALL THERE IS TO WATCH. THIS SEEMS TO BE NEARER, BUT STILL I FEEL THAT MORE SOFT FOCUSING OF THE AWARENESS WOULD TAKE ME FURTHER AND FURTHER BACK, AS IF RELAXING ENOUGH TO LET THE WATCHER MOVE FAR ENOUGH AWAY SO THAT ALL IS SEEN, RATHER THAN ANY ONE THING LIKE THOUGHTS OR BREATHING. DOES RELAXING ALLOW THE WATCHER TO BE ON THE HILL?\nIt is true. Relaxation helps the most. No part of concentration should be in your watchfulness. Concentration is sabotaging the whole process of watchfulness, because concentration is an act of the mind, and watchfulness is something that comes from above, from beyond.\nIf there is any concentration... I can understand, if you start watching your breathing – in the name of watching, you are concentrating on the breathing, you are excluding everything else. Don’t exclude. Watch your breathing inclusive of all.\nWatching your breathing... a temple bell starts ringing, a car passes by, a child starts crying – all that should be included. Your watchfulness should be open. Watching the breathing is simply to begin with. It is not the end. It is just learning how to watch.\nBut there is a difficulty – you can start thinking that concentration is watching. Concentration is not watching. Concentration is narrow, narrowing the mind, bringing it to a focus on one thing, forgetting everything else. That’s why in relaxing, you will feel more watchful, yet without concentration. If that is happening, that’s perfectly good.\nThe essential thing is watchfulness, inclusive of all. Concentration can be disturbed, watchfulness cannot be disturbed. These are the differences. If somebody is concentrating on something, anybody can disturb him. Just a small boy can do something and he is distracted and his focus is lost – or not even a small boy, just the wind comes and the door opens and the noise is enough.\nSo you will find the phenomenon in so-called religious people. They are always angry, because their concentration is continuously disturbed.\nWatchfulness cannot be disturbed. It is simply inclusive of all. If the door opens, makes a noise, the wind passes through the trees singing its song, it is available to it. It is not choosing breathing or anything in particular, but simply being there, open, available, present to everything that is happening.\nSo remember the difference: concentration is sabotaging watchfulness.\nTo begin with, something has to be given to you, so you can have a little taste of what watchfulness is. Then it has to be made wider and wider and bigger, so much bigger that there is no need to do anything. You simply sit, or lie down relaxedly and everything that is happening around you is mirrored in you.\nYou don’t think about it, you don’t justify it, you don’t condemn it, you don’t evaluate it – you simply watch.\nSo it is perfectly right. Relaxation, utter relaxation with no focusing of consciousness is real watchfulness.\nQuestion 3 BELOVED OSHO,\nONCE, SOME YEARS AGO, WHILE MAKING LOVE, I DISAPPEARED. I WOULD LIKE TO SAY, “LITERALLY DISAPPEARED,” BECAUSE I FELT AS IF ALL OF ME SIMPLY VANISHED. BUT CERTAINLY MY BODY MUST HAVE BEEN THERE, BECAUSE MY PARTNER DIDN’T NOTICE THAT HE WAS SUDDENLY ALONE. I HEARD MY VOICE SAY: “I AM GOING,” AND THEN POSSIBLY ONLY FOR A SECOND OR TWO, NO ONE WAS THERE. THOUGH I HAVE HAD MOMENTS OF JOY WHILE MAKING LOVE SINCE, I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN PRESENT TO KNOW THAT THEY ARE MOMENTS OF JOY. PRESUMABLY ECSTASY WAS THE TRIGGER FOR WHAT HAPPENED, BUT THE HAPPENING ITSELF WASN’T ECSTATIC, IT WASN’T ANYTHING, IT SIMPLY WAS.\nIS MEDITATION THAT PREVIOUS STAGE OF ECSTASY, OR THAT STATE OF NOT-EVEN- ECSTASY, JUST ISNESS?\nEcstasy or blissfulness are all toys to allure you towards meditation. You will find them only in the beginning. As the meditation grows deeper there is only isness.\nEverything disappears, even ecstasy, because ecstasy too, carries with it, just behind it, the shadow of agony. It is a duality. Blissfulness carries with it, hiding behind it, suffering, misery. It is a duality. Only isness is not a duality because isness is simply synonymous with existence, and there is no non-existence.\nAnything can trigger it. Love is one of the most likely things to trigger it because you are so totally in it, so intensely in it – and without any effort. It is a biological help to man to experience his first isness. It can be scary to feel that you have literally disappeared, and to tell your partner, “I am going,” rather than “I am coming!” – is to kill the poor man! What is happening? What kind of love is happening?\nHe has always heard that in love one comes, but this is a rare quality – to be going! The man must have been cultured; otherwise he would have got up and said, “I am going also! you are going – what am I doing here?” He was a man of culture and etiquette that he remained!\nBut coming and going – both are two sides of the same coin. People have noted only the coming; they have not been sharp enough to see the other side of it. The moment of coming is simultaneously the moment of going. You as a personality, you as an ego, are going; you as pure isness, are coming. So they are not contradictory, they are complementary.\nBut it can be triggered anywhere... sometimes for no reason at all – just the situation – and you may not be able even to know what has triggered it.\nI used to go for a morning walk, and I used to pass a beautiful house every day – that was my route. And one day, when I was coming back, the sun was just shining on my face; I was perspiring – I had gone for four, five miles, and just... I could not move from that place. I must have been eighteen or seventeen. Something happened between the sun and the beautiful morning, that I simply forgot that I have to go home. I simply forgot that I am. I was simply standing there.\nBut the man who owned the house, he has been watching me for almost a year – that I come and go by the side of the house; today, what has happened? I am simply frozen. But frozen in such ecstasy!\nHe came and shook me, and it was like coming down from a very far away place, rushing into my body. He said, “What has happened?”\nI said, “That’s what I was going to ask you. Something certainly happened, and something that I would like to happen forever. I was not. You unnecessarily got worried, shook me, and brought me back. I had moved into some space which was absolutely new to me – and it was pure isness.”\nAnything can do, it seems that just your preparedness, knowingly or unknowingly, your closeness to the point where the phenomenon can be triggered.But this kind of experience is not within your\npower. It happens to you like lightning. You cannot do anything to bring it back, unless you start with a device that suits you; for example, if relaxation suits you, then whenever you have time, relax – and relaxation does not mean that you have to lie down and relax. You can go on walking and relax. You can go on working, but in a relaxed way. No tension, no hurry, no speed, nowhere to gojust\nin the moment.\nAnd the window will be opening again and again and more often, and one day it remains open forever.\nIt is pure isness.\nChetana has asked one question: when awareness is total and all thoughts disappear, does enlightenment, realization, or any other experience happen or only the awareness remain?\nThe truth is that all experiences are lower. Truth is not an experience. It has to be said that it is an experience; otherwise how to convey it to you?\nTruth is pure awareness.\nJust all is, and all is beautiful, and all is benediction. But the basic quality is of awareness.\nYou can call it isness.\nThe Sanskrit word for theist is astik. It is a beautiful word, distorted because of the association with God. Astik comes from the root, ast, and asti means isness. In that sense, nobody is astik by believing in God; astik is one who has come to the state of isness, and this state is not separate so there is no way of it going away; it remains.\nAll words – silence, peace, ecstasy, blissfulness – fall short. The juice of isness is far deeper, far juicier than any word that any human language can provide.\nQuestion 4 BELOVED OSHO,\nLAUGHING WITH YOU IS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL, PURE AND FREEING EXPERIENCE. WITHIN SECONDS IT TAKES AWAY ALL HEAVINESS AND THOUGHTS. I WOULD LIKE TO DANCE THE PATH WITH YOU, LAUGHING AND LAUGHING. WHAT IS LAUGHING IN YOU? WHAT IS LAUGHING IN US, AND WANTS TO LAUGH? WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A BUDDHA’S LAUGHTER AND THE DISCIPLE’S LAUGHTER?\nThat is the only place where there is no difference. That’s why it is the greatest spiritual phenomenon: the master’s laughter and the disciple’s laughter have exactly the same quality, the same value. There is no difference at all.\nIn every other thing there are differences: the disciple is a disciple, he is learning, groping in the dark. The master is full of light, all groping has ceased, so every act is going to be different. But whether you are in darkness or in full light, laughter can join you.\nThe darkness cannot distort laughter, it cannot contaminate it; neither can the light enhance it. To me, laughter is the highest spiritual quality, where the ignorant and the enlightened meet.\nAnd if a tradition is too serious, and the master and the disciples never laugh, that means that in that tradition, there is no possibility of meeting: there is a demarcation.\nOne of my contributions to religion is a sense of humor which no other religion contains. And one of my basic statements about it is that laughter is the highest spiritual quality.\nIt is such a strange world. Just a few days ago, a court in Germany in a way decided in my favor against the government, but in a way the judge could not understand my approach to life. The government was trying to prove that I am not a religious person, because I myself have said that religion is dead, I myself have said that I am not a serious person, and the judge said: “Those statements were made in a press conference, they cannot be taken seriously. And we do not know the context. You have to produce statements from his written books. I consider him to be a religious man, and I consider his teachings to be a religion. And whatever he is saying and doing is a serious work.”\nAlthough we won the case, the judge could not understand, neither could the government.\nI am seriously non-serious, but that is beyond the scope of courts to understand. I am religiously non-religious, but courts are not meant to understand such koans. The government was thinking that to bring the point that I have said I am not a serious person is enough to prove that I am not religious, because all religious people have been serious.\nHalf of it is true: all religious people up to now have been serious. And it is because of their seriousness that humanity has not come to a transformation. If all the religious people could laugh\nrather than just talking about beliefs, arguing about things which cannot be proved.… If Gautam Buddha and Confucius and Lao Tzu and Moses and Zarathustra and Jesus and Mohammed all could have gathered together and laughed, human consciousness would have taken a quantum leap. Their seriousness has become a heaviness on the human heart. It creates guilt in people: when you laugh, you feel you are doing something wrong.\nLaughter is good in a movie hall, but not in a church. In a church, you almost enter a graveyard where poor Jesus is still hung on the cross. Twenty centuries... you can take him down now. The Jews hung him for only six hours, and Christians have been hanging him for twenty centuries. And seeing the poor fellow hanging there – it is difficult to laugh.\nAll the religions have made it difficult to laugh. Sense of humor has not been recognized by any religion as a religious quality.\nI declare it to be the highest religious quality. And if we can decide that every year, for one hour, at a certain date, at a certain time, the whole world will laugh, I think it will help to dispel darkness, violence, stupidities – because laughter is the only human characteristic which no animal possesses.\nAll animals are incapable of laughter, and whenever these religions make somebody a saint, he becomes like an animal, he loses laughter. He falls down the evolutionary ladder, not rises higher.\nLaughter has a beauty, multidimensional. It can relax you, it can suddenly make you feel light, it can make your world not a burden, but a beautiful experience. It can change everything in your life. Just the touch of laughter can make life something worth living, something to be grateful for.\nSo as far as laughter is concerned, the master and disciple meet only at that point. That’s why it is so refreshing, so rejuvenating.\nQuestion 5 BELOVED OSHO,\nONE OF THE THINGS I HAVE HEARD SOME PEOPLE SAY ABOUT YOU IS THAT THEY THINK YOU ARE THE ANTICHRIST.\nWOULD YOU PLEASE COMMENT?\nThese are the same people who crucified Christ on the grounds that he was not Christ. And these are the same people who poisoned Socrates, claiming absolutely falsely that he is demoralizing the youth, corrupting the youth. These are the same people who murdered Al-Hillaj Mansoor, saying that his utterances are against God. Because he was saying, “I am God” – “Ana’l Haq.”\nBut he was not saying, “You are not God,” he was saying, “You are God too, but you are determined not to recognize it. I have dropped the old stubbornness and I have recognized that I am God.” Nothing was wrong in it.\nNow they are saying the same things about me. In fact all the things that they said about Socrates – that he is destroying people’s morals, corrupting their minds – they are saying about me. One\ngovernment to another government, one nation to another nation, they are sending messages that this man is capable of corrupting human minds; hence, he is dangerous.\nThe Christians think I am the Antichrist because that is their way of condemning a person, although I have praised Christ more than any Christian has ever done. But I am absolutely fair: if I see that something is not correct then it does not matter who the person is; I will criticize it. I have praised Christ, I have criticized Christ. I have praised Buddha, I have criticized Buddha, because no human being is perfect. Perfection is not possible.\nWhat they said about Al-Hillaj Mansoor, they are saying about me, that I am against God. And I had devoted my whole life to teach people how to be godly.\nOne thing should be understood: that all these people have no arguments against me so they just pick up a name which condemns me, without giving any argument. They should prove on what grounds they call me Antichrist, because I am fighting on many fronts; I am not only fighting against Christians, I am fighting against Jews, against Mohammedans, against Jainas, against Buddhists.\nWhere in their Christian scriptures is it written that the Antichrist will fight against all religions? Where in their Christian scriptures it is written that the Antichrist will teach people how to rise in consciousness towards enlightenment?\nThey don’t give any arguments, they simply condemn. Their condemnations are meaningless. They simply show the poverty of their intelligence. They simply show the anger and rage that is boiling within them. In fact, they are saying that if they kill me it will be perfectly right, because I am the Antichrist. They are trying to find an excuse to justify their actions against me.\nBut Hindus also want to kill me. They have tried. Mohammedans also want to kill me.\nI think if I was the Antichrist, then all the religions who are anti-Christian would have accepted me with great joy – here comes the Antichrist who will destroy Christianity. They will not be against me. They will not be against the Antichrist.\nBut you can say anything. The archbishop in Greece declared that I have been sent from hell, a direct messenger from hell, to destroy the Christian orthodox church of Greece; and I was only a tourist for four weeks there. The messenger from hell comes on a tourist visa for four weeks. Have you ever heard such a thing before?\nThese are just old rotten strategies to condemn something which they cannot argue against, but they are utterly meaningless.\nIf I am the Antichrist, I have challenged the pope to face me in a public encounter – not anywhere else, but in the Vatican. Christ is on their side, I am the Antichrist – it will really be a great discussion.\nBut these cowards go on doing things against me in an underground way, and they keep their hypocrisy intact.\nIn Italy, sixty-five eminent people in different fields – Nobel prize winners, painters, dancers, directors of world fame, actors, actresses, writers, poets, all kinds of creative people – have signed a petition to the government that I should not be prevented from entering Italy – why am I not being given a visa?\nBut the pope is preventing it. The government does not say yes or no because that will create a great uproar all over the country. They cannot say yes because the pope is against it, and Catholics may not support them in the coming elections so they want to just keep it in limbo.\nBut they should see that their most talented people and their geniuses are asking that I should be allowed and I should be listened to.\nI have said to my sannyasins, “You go to the pope too with the protest to sign. If he does not sign it, that means he is against freedom of speech. If he signs it, then show it to the government – ‘Now you are in no danger, even the pope has signed.’ So put him in an embarrassing situation.”\nI would love to argue on each and every point because Christianity has nothing worthwhile that can be supported by intelligence. That is their fear; otherwise, a four-week tourist visa cannot destroy a church, cannot destroy a country’s morality. And if it can be destroyed in four weeks then it is not worth preserving, it should be destroyed. For two thousand years, you have been creating it and a tourist for four weeks will destroy it... that shows the quality of your morality, your religion, your philosophy.\nThings are coming closer to an ultimate exposure, and it is going to be tremendously helpful because all the world governments are now caught in a net.\nI am going to fight every country in their own courts, and I am going to enter every country – because nobody can prevent it without any reason, just out of fear.\nAll these great nations are proving to be simply cowards. Question 6\nBELOVED OSHO,\nFOR CHRISTIANS, THE GREATEST MIRACLE IS THAT JESUS COULD WALK ON WATER.\nAS I SAW YOU WOBBLE, ENTERING THE ROOM YESTERDAY MORNING, I HELD MY BREATH. IS NOT THE GREATEST MIRACLE JUST THAT YOU MAKE IT TO YOUR CHAIR WALKING ON THE ORDINARY FLOORS OF THIS HOUSE?\nMilarepa, although you only imagine that you are enlightened, even in your imagined enlightenment you get a few beautiful glimpses. This is true – walking on water is just an invented story.\nI have heard that two old rabbis and one Christian bishop – all great friends – went fishing one day on the sea of Galilee. The rabbis asked the bishop, “Do you believe that Jesus walked on water?”\nHe said, “Of course.” Then they said, “Can you walk then?”\nThat frightened him. He said, “I will walk only if you two walk first – because you are an older religion. Jesus was a Jew. You are Jews. And you are great rabbis.”\nSo one rabbi went out of the boat, walked twenty feet on water and came back. The bishop could not believe his eyes.\nThe second rabbi went out, walked twenty feet and came back. The bishop said, “My God!”\nBut now he had gathered courage... if two rabbis can walk – who are not even Christians, and I am a follower of Christ.He got out of the boat and as he put his first foot in the water, he started\ndrowning. The two old rabbis said to each other, giggling, “Should we tell the poor boy where the rocks are?”\nNobody has walked on water; you have just to know where the rocks are.\nBut this is really a miracle every morning, Milarepa. I wake up and I think whether I am going to make it to that goddamned chair. But somehow or other, the miracle has continued to happen, and I think it will continue to happen. I am completely drunk on the divine. So it is a miracle to find the way – and that’s why my people have made the chair red, so that I can see where it is.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"6026","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_transmission_of_the_lamp/part12/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_transmission_of_the_lamp/>The Transmission of the Lamp</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">12 Laughter is the highest spiritual quality</h1><div class=post-meta>29 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;6026 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Transmission_of_the_Lamp/part12.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part11>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

OPEN- MINDED SCIENTIST WHOSE FIELD IS BIOLOGY, AND PARTICULARLY
EVOLUTION. IT SEEMS PROBABLE THAT ABOUT FIVE TO EIGHT MILLION YEARS AGO
THE CHIMP-HUMAN ANCESTRAL LINE SPLIT INTO WHAT WAS TO BECOME MODERN
CHIMP AND MODERN MAN. Homo Erectus APPEARED ABOUT A MILLION OR SO YEARS
AGO.</p><p><br></p><p>THE INTEREST IN ALL THIS IS THAT IF TRUE, IT MEANS THAT MAN LEARNED
TO STAND UP VERY FAST IN EVOLUTIONARY TERMS – OVER ONLY ABOUT A MILLION
YEARS. ELSEWHERE, IN TRYING TO EXPLAIN MISSING FOSSILS IT HAS BEEN
SUGGESTED THAT EVOLUTION IS NOT NECESSARILY SLOW, BUT MAY OCCUR IN
SUDDEN LEAPS.</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN I THINK OF AN IMAGINARY CONVERSATION BETWEEN PRE-CHIMP AND
PRE-HUMAN, AS THEY PARTED COMPANY SO LONG AGO, I THINK OF YOU TALKING TO
MANKIND.</p><p><br></p><p>ARE WE LIVING THROUGH AN EQUALLY MOMENTOUS POINT IN EVOLUTION, WHERE
YOU, AS THE FIRST OF Homo Novus POINT TO A BEAUTIFUL VISION WHICH IS AS
FAR REMOVED FROM Homo Sapiens AS HE, IN TURN, IS FROM THE CHIMPANZEE?
MIGHT THE JUMP INTO ENLIGHTENMENT AS A QUANTUM LEAP IN CONSCIOUSNESS
HAVE ANY NATURAL EQUIVALENT IN EVOLUTIONARY JUMPS IN THE PHYSICAL
WORLD?</p><p>The quantum leap is the latest discovery in modern physics. Up to now
evolution was always thought of as a slow process. Hence it was always
contrasted with revolution. Revolution was fast, quick; evolution was
very slow.</p><p><br></p><p>But a quantum leap cannot even be called fast. It is instantaneous:
from one point, from one stage, you disappear, and you appear at a
higher, at a different point, at a different stage.</p><p><br></p><p>It was very puzzling in the beginning because no such thing had ever
been conceived of. But slowly, slowly physics has settled with it, that
it is a reality. Electrons disappear from one point and appear at
another point and between the two there is no time gap. Here it
disappears, there it appears; the distance is covered but time is not
taken in covering the distance.</p><p><br></p><p>In physics it has now become accepted; in metaphysics, as far as
human consciousness is concerned, it can be even quicker, because if
matter can take such jumps that it moves almost beyond imagination,
beyond the speed of time, in consciousness many more miracles are
possible, because of course consciousness is the highest flowering of
existence. It seems that the whole existence has been working to reach
to the stage of a Gautam Buddha. Gautam Buddha followed slowly the path
of evolution, because that was the only possibility in those days.</p><p><br></p><p>After twenty-five centuries, it is possible to declare that quantum
leaps are available, for those who have the courage, in the field of
consciousness too. Particularly in consciousness, time has no reference,
no relevance – consciousness in non-temporal.</p><p><br></p><p>One can move from sleep to awakening instantly – or do you think it
takes a long slow process – that first one is partly awake, then a
little more awake, and by the evening one is fully awake? And then the
second process starts – you start partly asleep, then more, then more,
then by midnight you are fast asleep?</p><p><br></p><p>We know that it happens to everybody that you wake up instantly. Any
device may do – just an alarm clock, which has nothing to do with you.
The alarm clock is not even aware of you, is not concerned with you – it
may be enough to change you from deep sleep into a quick awakening. The
same is possible as far as spiritual sleep is concerned. It is only a
question of finding a device. The problem is a little complicated,
because an alarm clock will do for everybody, but spiritual devices are
meant for unique individuals. One device will not work for all, because
people are so different, so unique. Nature does not produce carbon
copies, everybody is original. Hence he needs an original device.</p><p><br></p><p>In the past, one hundred and twelve methods have been found for
meditation – those are the devices. The undercurrent is the same, just
the devices are a little different from each other, because individuals
are different from each other.</p><p><br></p><p>The religions which have been teaching the same prayer to everybody
are doing an enormous harm, because that prayer in the first place is
based on a belief in a God no one has seen, no one has heard of.
Different religions define God in a different way.</p><p><br></p><p>In England there is now a growing movement of satanism, devil
worshippers. Thirty thousand people already openly declare that the
devil is not God’s enemy, but God’s only begotten son. And they worship
the devil because God, after creating the world, has either gone senile
or has completely</p><p>forgotten about the world. But one thing is certain, that he is no
more interested, because after those six days, he has never been seen.
There is not a single eyewitness. So why bother the old fellow? His
young son, the devil... the word ‘devil’ helps them, because it comes
from the same Sanskrit root as ‘divine’. It means ‘godly’.</p><p><br></p><p>It depends on you what you make of God, and such things. Nobody
interferes. God has never said anything about himself. He has never said
to any religion “Don’t say these things, they are not true.” In fact God
is only an image created by man, so is the devil.</p><p><br></p><p>You can change your images, and you can go on praying to your own
handmade, homemade gods for millions of years. Nothing will happen to
you, because these are not devices.</p><p><br></p><p>I have told you Leo Tolstoy’s story. Before the Russian revolution,
Russia was one of the most orthodox Christian countries, more than
anywhere else. The archbishop of the Russian church was getting more and
more angry about three men who lived beyond a lake, under a tree – poor
folks, villagers, uneducated, uncultured; but people had started
worshipping them as saints.</p><p><br></p><p>And thousands of people were going there. And that was hurting him
very much. These were the people who were supposed to come to his
church; they are going to three persons who are not even recognized by
the church as saints.</p><p><br></p><p>The English word ‘saint’ is ugly. It comes from the original
‘sanction’ – a man who has been sanctioned by the church in his
holiness. He has a certificate of holiness from the church.</p><p><br></p><p>These people have never been sanctioned in any holiness, and
thousands of people are going. Finally, outraged, he himself went in a
boat.</p><p><br></p><p>Those three poor fellows were sitting under a tree, very happy, very
peaceful, very silent. But the archbishop was very angry. He screamed at
them, shouted at them. They all kneeled before him and said, “Forgive us
if we have done anything wrong, but why are you shouting? What is the
problem?”</p><p><br></p><p>The archbishop said, “Who told you you are saints?”</p><p><br></p><p>They said, “Nobody, and we don’t think we are saints, we are poor
people. But what can we do if people have started coming to us, just as
you have come. What can we do?”</p><p><br></p><p>“But why have people started coming to you? What is your
religion?”</p><p><br></p><p>They looked at each other. They said, “We are uneducated people;
don’t talk in such cultured, sophisticated language. Make it
simple.”</p><p><br></p><p>The archbishop was happy that they were humbled by him. He said,
“What prayer do you do?” All the three giggled. He said, “What is there
to giggle about; is this your prayer?”</p><p>They said, “No, this is not, but what it is creates giggling.” “Say
it.”</p><p>Everybody said to the other, “You say it.” The second said to the
third, “Better you say it. You are older than us. It is your right to
say it.”</p><p><br></p><p>The archbishop said, “I don’t have much time. Say it! What is your
prayer?”</p><p><br></p><p>They said, “We are ashamed. Just forgive us, because our prayer is
very poor. Hearing that God is a trinity and we are also a trinity, we
have made our own prayer. Our prayer is simple because we are very
simple people. We cannot remember long words and big prayers. Our prayer
is, ‘You are three, we are three; have mercy on us.’”</p><p><br></p><p>Even the archbishop giggled. He said, “This is a prayer? You were
right that it brings giggling. I have never giggled in my life, I am a
serious man, but seeing you three fools creating a prayer on your own –
and we have a prayer authorized by the church. I will tell you the
authorized prayer, and from today, you start the authorized prayer.
Become real Christians!”</p><p><br></p><p>They said, “We will try. Just tell us what we have to do.” So he
repeated the whole authorized Russian prayer. As he was saying the
prayer, all the three were becoming very sad. At the end, they said, “It
is almost impossible for us to remember. You will have to repeat it two,
three times so that we can manage. One part I will remember, another
part the other remembers, the third part, the third remembers. But the
whole prayer to be remembered by one single person is asking too
much.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Okay, that will do, but at least it will be authorized
prayer, the right prayer, the only right prayer in the world.” So he
repeated again.</p><p><br></p><p>They thanked him; “It was great of you to come here. God must have
sent you here.”</p><p><br></p><p>And he went very happily back in his boat, feeling satisfied that now
this foolishness will stop. People will not go to these people. I will
expose them, that this is their prayer. And how have they become
saints?</p><p><br></p><p>But in the middle of the lake, he saw suddenly all three running on
water towards him. He said, “My God!”</p><p><br></p><p>They caught the boat and said, “One more time because we forgot. We
forgot which part is to be remembered by whom. And there was so much
conflict that we said it is better to go to you. You can decide which
part – and the reality is, we have forgotten the prayer. You repeat it
once more.”</p><p><br></p><p>But now it was a revelation to the archbishop, that these people are
walking on water. He said, “Forget the prayer I have told you. Your
prayer is right. You continue your prayer, because I have been praying
this authorized prayer my whole life. I cannot walk on water. My prayer
has not been heard, but your prayer has been heard. You go. Just forgive
me for interfering in your life. Whatever you are doing is right.
Continue doing it in your own way.”</p><p><br></p><p>These one hundred and twelve methods of meditation are exhaustive.
There cannot be one hundred and thirteen. Everything that different
human types will need is included in one hundred and twelve methods. And
they are handed down from centuries. They are simple. The key in all
those one hundred and twelve methods is witnessing – in different forms,
in different strategies – but the</p><p>innermost core is witnessing, awareness, watchfulness. You can call
it anything, but it will be another meaning of witnessing.</p><p><br></p><p>With witnessing, you can have a quantum leap. You can move from your
sleep – not the ordinary, but the spiritual sleep – and you can wake up.
Not the ordinary waking that you have done every morning, but the real
awakening, which brings you to the highest realization in life – of
yourself, and the whole, and that you are part of it; that the whole is
you and that you are the whole. There is no distinction.</p><p><br></p><p>Physics has given the words ‘quantum leap’. No spiritual thinker,
philosopher, has tried to think of a parallel for spiritual growth. That
shows the poverty of your so-called spiritual thinkers, theologians. But
in fact, meditation is the way which can bring a sudden flare-up in your
being. And not only that, it can start a chain reaction. One flares up
and suddenly people of the same type, who have not even tried
meditation, who are not even seekers, who have never thought about
anything spiritual, catch the infection – it is contagious.</p><p><br></p><p>So a few people around the earth get the quantum leap, then thousands
more will become part of a world-wide fire. And that is the only way to
save whatever millions of years of evolution has brought to us.</p><p><br></p><p>You have to choose between Ronald Reagan and Gautam Buddha. It is not
a coincidence that Ronald Reagan used to have a chimpanzee as his
friend. A man is known by the company he keeps. And when he became
president, the chimpanzee was also very happy.</p><p><br></p><p>They both went for a walk. An old man saw the chimpanzee and Ronald
Reagan; he was ashamed that the president of America cannot find
friendship with any human being, he has to find friendship with a
chimpanzee.</p><p><br></p><p>He went close to them and said, “Mr. President, this does not look
good.” Ronald Reagan said, “What does not look good?”</p><p>That old man said, “You shut up, idiot. I am talking to the
president. You have no right to interfere. You may be his friend, not
mine.”</p><p><br></p><p>The future is in danger if man does not understand the methods that
can bring him quick transformation. We don’t have time for evolution. We
don’t have time even for revolution. Only a quantum leap can save
humanity and the universe.</p><p><br></p><p>And I think as the pressure of death, destructiveness, nuclear war,
becomes more and more heavy, the quantum leap will also become more and
more possible, because it will be the only way out of a global
suicide.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>WHEN WE START WATCHING OUR BODIES, AND THEN OUR MINDS AND EMOTIONS,
THERE REMAINS AN ELEMENT, ALTHOUGH SUBTLE, OF CONCENTRATION. INITIALLY,
FOR EXAMPLE, WATCHING MY BREATHING, I WOULD WATCH IT TO THE EXCLUSION OF
EVERYTHING ELSE – HERE THERE WAS AN ELEMENT OF FOCUS. ON OTHER
OCCASIONS, WHEN SILENCE IS JUST THERE, THE BREATHING MAY BE ALL THERE IS
TO WATCH. THIS SEEMS TO BE NEARER, BUT STILL I FEEL THAT MORE SOFT
FOCUSING OF THE AWARENESS WOULD TAKE ME FURTHER AND FURTHER BACK, AS IF
RELAXING ENOUGH TO LET THE WATCHER MOVE FAR ENOUGH AWAY SO THAT ALL IS
SEEN, RATHER THAN ANY ONE THING LIKE THOUGHTS OR BREATHING. DOES
RELAXING ALLOW THE WATCHER TO BE ON THE HILL?</p><p><br></p><p>It is true. Relaxation helps the most. No part of concentration
should be in your watchfulness. Concentration is sabotaging the whole
process of watchfulness, because concentration is an act of the mind,
and watchfulness is something that comes from above, from beyond.</p><p><br></p><p>If there is any concentration... I can understand, if you start
watching your breathing – in the name of watching, you are concentrating
on the breathing, you are excluding everything else. Don’t exclude.
Watch your breathing inclusive of all.</p><p><br></p><p>Watching your breathing... a temple bell starts ringing, a car passes
by, a child starts crying – all that should be included. Your
watchfulness should be open. Watching the breathing is simply to begin
with. It is not the end. It is just learning how to watch.</p><p><br></p><p>But there is a difficulty – you can start thinking that concentration
is watching. Concentration is not watching. Concentration is narrow,
narrowing the mind, bringing it to a focus on one thing, forgetting
everything else. That’s why in relaxing, you will feel more watchful,
yet without concentration. If that is happening, that’s perfectly
good.</p><p><br></p><p>The essential thing is watchfulness, inclusive of all. Concentration
can be disturbed, watchfulness cannot be disturbed. These are the
differences. If somebody is concentrating on something, anybody can
disturb him. Just a small boy can do something and he is distracted and
his focus is lost – or not even a small boy, just the wind comes and the
door opens and the noise is enough.</p><p><br></p><p>So you will find the phenomenon in so-called religious people. They
are always angry, because their concentration is continuously
disturbed.</p><p><br></p><p>Watchfulness cannot be disturbed. It is simply inclusive of all. If
the door opens, makes a noise, the wind passes through the trees singing
its song, it is available to it. It is not choosing breathing or
anything in particular, but simply being there, open, available, present
to everything that is happening.</p><p><br></p><p>So remember the difference: concentration is sabotaging
watchfulness.</p><p><br></p><p>To begin with, something has to be given to you, so you can have a
little taste of what watchfulness is. Then it has to be made wider and
wider and bigger, so much bigger that there is no need to do anything.
You simply sit, or lie down relaxedly and everything that is happening
around you is mirrored in you.</p><p>You don’t think about it, you don’t justify it, you don’t condemn it,
you don’t evaluate it – you simply watch.</p><p><br></p><p>So it is perfectly right. Relaxation, utter relaxation with no
focusing of consciousness is real watchfulness.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 3 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>ONCE, SOME YEARS AGO, WHILE MAKING LOVE, I DISAPPEARED. I WOULD LIKE
TO SAY, “LITERALLY DISAPPEARED,” BECAUSE I FELT AS IF ALL OF ME SIMPLY
VANISHED. BUT CERTAINLY MY BODY MUST HAVE BEEN THERE, BECAUSE MY PARTNER
DIDN’T NOTICE THAT HE WAS SUDDENLY ALONE. I HEARD MY VOICE SAY: “I AM
GOING,” AND THEN POSSIBLY ONLY FOR A SECOND OR TWO, NO ONE WAS THERE.
THOUGH I HAVE HAD MOMENTS OF JOY WHILE MAKING LOVE SINCE, I HAVE ALWAYS
BEEN PRESENT TO KNOW THAT THEY ARE MOMENTS OF JOY. PRESUMABLY ECSTASY
WAS THE TRIGGER FOR WHAT HAPPENED, BUT THE HAPPENING ITSELF WASN’T
ECSTATIC, IT WASN’T ANYTHING, IT SIMPLY WAS.</p><p><br></p><p>IS MEDITATION THAT PREVIOUS STAGE OF ECSTASY, OR THAT STATE OF
NOT-EVEN- ECSTASY, JUST ISNESS?</p><p><br></p><p>Ecstasy or blissfulness are all toys to allure you towards
meditation. You will find them only in the beginning. As the meditation
grows deeper there is only isness.</p><p><br></p><p>Everything disappears, even ecstasy, because ecstasy too, carries
with it, just behind it, the shadow of agony. It is a duality.
Blissfulness carries with it, hiding behind it, suffering, misery. It is
a duality. Only isness is not a duality because isness is simply
synonymous with existence, and there is no non-existence.</p><p><br></p><p>Anything can trigger it. Love is one of the most likely things to
trigger it because you are so totally in it, so intensely in it – and
without any effort. It is a biological help to man to experience his
first isness. It can be scary to feel that you have literally
disappeared, and to tell your partner, “I am going,” rather than “I am
coming!” – is to kill the poor man! What is happening? What kind of love
is happening?</p><p><br></p><p>He has always heard that in love one comes, but this is a rare
quality – to be going! The man must have been cultured; otherwise he
would have got up and said, “I am going also! you are going – what am I
doing here?” He was a man of culture and etiquette that he remained!</p><p><br></p><p>But coming and going – both are two sides of the same coin. People
have noted only the coming; they have not been sharp enough to see the
other side of it. The moment of coming is simultaneously the moment of
going. You as a personality, you as an ego, are going; you as pure
isness, are coming. So they are not contradictory, they are
complementary.</p><p><br></p><p>But it can be triggered anywhere... sometimes for no reason at all –
just the situation – and you may not be able even to know what has
triggered it.</p><p>I used to go for a morning walk, and I used to pass a beautiful house
every day – that was my route. And one day, when I was coming back, the
sun was just shining on my face; I was perspiring – I had gone for four,
five miles, and just... I could not move from that place. I must have
been eighteen or seventeen. Something happened between the sun and the
beautiful morning, that I simply forgot that I have to go home. I simply
forgot that I am. I was simply standing there.</p><p><br></p><p>But the man who owned the house, he has been watching me for almost a
year – that I come and go by the side of the house; today, what has
happened? I am simply frozen. But frozen in such ecstasy!</p><p><br></p><p>He came and shook me, and it was like coming down from a very far
away place, rushing into my body. He said, “What has happened?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “That’s what I was going to ask you. Something certainly
happened, and something that I would like to happen forever. I was not.
You unnecessarily got worried, shook me, and brought me back. I had
moved into some space which was absolutely new to me – and it was pure
isness.”</p><p><br></p><p>Anything can do, it seems that just your preparedness, knowingly or
unknowingly, your closeness to the point where the phenomenon can be
triggered.<span class=s4></span>But this kind of experience is not
within your</p><p>power. It happens to you like lightning. You cannot do anything to
bring it back, unless you start with a device that suits you; for
example, if relaxation suits you, then whenever you have time, relax –
and relaxation does not mean that you have to lie down and relax. You
can go on walking and relax. You can go on working, but in a relaxed
way. No tension, no hurry, no speed, nowhere to go<span class=s4></span>just</p><p>in the moment.</p><p><br></p><p>And the window will be opening again and again and more often, and
one day it remains open forever.</p><p><br></p><p>It is pure isness.</p><p><br></p><p>Chetana has asked one question: when awareness is total and all
thoughts disappear, does enlightenment, realization, or any other
experience happen or only the awareness remain?</p><p><br></p><p>The truth is that all experiences are lower. Truth is not an
experience. It has to be said that it is an experience; otherwise how to
convey it to you?</p><p><br></p><p>Truth is pure awareness.</p><p><br></p><p>Just all is, and all is beautiful, and all is benediction. But the
basic quality is of awareness.</p><p>You can call it isness.</p><p><br></p><p>The Sanskrit word for theist is astik. It is a beautiful word,
distorted because of the association with God. Astik comes from the
root, ast, and asti means isness. In that sense, nobody is astik by
believing in God; astik is one who has come to the state of isness, and
this state is not separate so there is no way of it going away; it
remains.</p><p>All words – silence, peace, ecstasy, blissfulness – fall short. The
juice of isness is far deeper, far juicier than any word that any human
language can provide.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 4 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>LAUGHING WITH YOU IS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL, PURE AND FREEING EXPERIENCE.
WITHIN SECONDS IT TAKES AWAY ALL HEAVINESS AND THOUGHTS. I WOULD LIKE TO
DANCE THE PATH WITH YOU, LAUGHING AND LAUGHING. WHAT IS LAUGHING IN YOU?
WHAT IS LAUGHING IN US, AND WANTS TO LAUGH? WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN A BUDDHA’S LAUGHTER AND THE DISCIPLE’S LAUGHTER?</p><p><br></p><p>That is the only place where there is no difference. That’s why it is
the greatest spiritual phenomenon: the master’s laughter and the
disciple’s laughter have exactly the same quality, the same value. There
is no difference at all.</p><p><br></p><p>In every other thing there are differences: the disciple is a
disciple, he is learning, groping in the dark. The master is full of
light, all groping has ceased, so every act is going to be different.
But whether you are in darkness or in full light, laughter can join
you.</p><p><br></p><p>The darkness cannot distort laughter, it cannot contaminate it;
neither can the light enhance it. To me, laughter is the highest
spiritual quality, where the ignorant and the enlightened meet.</p><p><br></p><p>And if a tradition is too serious, and the master and the disciples
never laugh, that means that in that tradition, there is no possibility
of meeting: there is a demarcation.</p><p><br></p><p>One of my contributions to religion is a sense of humor which no
other religion contains. And one of my basic statements about it is that
laughter is the highest spiritual quality.</p><p><br></p><p>It is such a strange world. Just a few days ago, a court in Germany
in a way decided in my favor against the government, but in a way the
judge could not understand my approach to life. The government was
trying to prove that I am not a religious person, because I myself have
said that religion is dead, I myself have said that I am not a serious
person, and the judge said: “Those statements were made in a press
conference, they cannot be taken seriously. And we do not know the
context. You have to produce statements from his written books. I
consider him to be a religious man, and I consider his teachings to be a
religion. And whatever he is saying and doing is a serious work.”</p><p><br></p><p>Although we won the case, the judge could not understand, neither
could the government.</p><p><br></p><p>I am seriously non-serious, but that is beyond the scope of courts to
understand. I am religiously non-religious, but courts are not meant to
understand such koans. The government was thinking that to bring the
point that I have said I am not a serious person is enough to prove that
I am not religious, because all religious people have been serious.</p><p><br></p><p>Half of it is true: all religious people up to now have been serious.
And it is because of their seriousness that humanity has not come to a
transformation. If all the religious people could laugh</p><p>rather than just talking about beliefs, arguing about things which
cannot be proved.… If Gautam Buddha and Confucius and Lao Tzu and Moses
and Zarathustra and Jesus and Mohammed all could have gathered together
and laughed, human consciousness would have taken a quantum leap. Their
seriousness has become a heaviness on the human heart. It creates guilt
in people: when you laugh, you feel you are doing something wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>Laughter is good in a movie hall, but not in a church. In a church,
you almost enter a graveyard where poor Jesus is still hung on the
cross. Twenty centuries... you can take him down now. The Jews hung him
for only six hours, and Christians have been hanging him for twenty
centuries. And seeing the poor fellow hanging there – it is difficult to
laugh.</p><p><br></p><p>All the religions have made it difficult to laugh. Sense of humor has
not been recognized by any religion as a religious quality.</p><p><br></p><p>I declare it to be the highest religious quality. And if we can
decide that every year, for one hour, at a certain date, at a certain
time, the whole world will laugh, I think it will help to dispel
darkness, violence, stupidities – because laughter is the only human
characteristic which no animal possesses.</p><p><br></p><p>All animals are incapable of laughter, and whenever these religions
make somebody a saint, he becomes like an animal, he loses laughter. He
falls down the evolutionary ladder, not rises higher.</p><p><br></p><p>Laughter has a beauty, multidimensional. It can relax you, it can
suddenly make you feel light, it can make your world not a burden, but a
beautiful experience. It can change everything in your life. Just the
touch of laughter can make life something worth living, something to be
grateful for.</p><p><br></p><p>So as far as laughter is concerned, the master and disciple meet only
at that point. That’s why it is so refreshing, so rejuvenating.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 5 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>ONE OF THE THINGS I HAVE HEARD SOME PEOPLE SAY ABOUT YOU IS THAT THEY
THINK YOU ARE THE ANTICHRIST.</p><p><br></p><p>WOULD YOU PLEASE COMMENT?</p><p><br></p><p>These are the same people who crucified Christ on the grounds that he
was not Christ. And these are the same people who poisoned Socrates,
claiming absolutely falsely that he is demoralizing the youth,
corrupting the youth. These are the same people who murdered Al-Hillaj
Mansoor, saying that his utterances are against God. Because he was
saying, “I am God” – “Ana’l Haq.”</p><p><br></p><p>But he was not saying, “You are not God,” he was saying, “You are God
too, but you are determined not to recognize it. I have dropped the old
stubbornness and I have recognized that I am God.” Nothing was wrong in
it.</p><p><br></p><p>Now they are saying the same things about me. In fact all the things
that they said about Socrates – that he is destroying people’s morals,
corrupting their minds – they are saying about me. One</p><p>government to another government, one nation to another nation, they
are sending messages that this man is capable of corrupting human minds;
hence, he is dangerous.</p><p><br></p><p>The Christians think I am the Antichrist because that is their way of
condemning a person, although I have praised Christ more than any
Christian has ever done. But I am absolutely fair: if I see that
something is not correct then it does not matter who the person is; I
will criticize it. I have praised Christ, I have criticized Christ. I
have praised Buddha, I have criticized Buddha, because no human being is
perfect. Perfection is not possible.</p><p><br></p><p>What they said about Al-Hillaj Mansoor, they are saying about me,
that I am against God. And I had devoted my whole life to teach people
how to be godly.</p><p><br></p><p>One thing should be understood: that all these people have no
arguments against me so they just pick up a name which condemns me,
without giving any argument. They should prove on what grounds they call
me Antichrist, because I am fighting on many fronts; I am not only
fighting against Christians, I am fighting against Jews, against
Mohammedans, against Jainas, against Buddhists.</p><p><br></p><p>Where in their Christian scriptures is it written that the Antichrist
will fight against all religions? Where in their Christian scriptures it
is written that the Antichrist will teach people how to rise in
consciousness towards enlightenment?</p><p><br></p><p>They don’t give any arguments, they simply condemn. Their
condemnations are meaningless. They simply show the poverty of their
intelligence. They simply show the anger and rage that is boiling within
them. In fact, they are saying that if they kill me it will be perfectly
right, because I am the Antichrist. They are trying to find an excuse to
justify their actions against me.</p><p><br></p><p>But Hindus also want to kill me. They have tried. Mohammedans also
want to kill me.</p><p>I think if I was the Antichrist, then all the religions who are
anti-Christian would have accepted me with great joy – here comes the
Antichrist who will destroy Christianity. They will not be against me.
They will not be against the Antichrist.</p><p><br></p><p>But you can say anything. The archbishop in Greece declared that I
have been sent from hell, a direct messenger from hell, to destroy the
Christian orthodox church of Greece; and I was only a tourist for four
weeks there. The messenger from hell comes on a tourist visa for four
weeks. Have you ever heard such a thing before?</p><p><br></p><p>These are just old rotten strategies to condemn something which they
cannot argue against, but they are utterly meaningless.</p><p><br></p><p>If I am the Antichrist, I have challenged the pope to face me in a
public encounter – not anywhere else, but in the Vatican. Christ is on
their side, I am the Antichrist – it will really be a great
discussion.</p><p><br></p><p>But these cowards go on doing things against me in an underground
way, and they keep their hypocrisy intact.</p><p>In Italy, sixty-five eminent people in different fields – Nobel prize
winners, painters, dancers, directors of world fame, actors, actresses,
writers, poets, all kinds of creative people – have signed a petition to
the government that I should not be prevented from entering Italy – why
am I not being given a visa?</p><p><br></p><p>But the pope is preventing it. The government does not say yes or no
because that will create a great uproar all over the country. They
cannot say yes because the pope is against it, and Catholics may not
support them in the coming elections so they want to just keep it in
limbo.</p><p><br></p><p>But they should see that their most talented people and their
geniuses are asking that I should be allowed and I should be listened
to.</p><p><br></p><p>I have said to my sannyasins, “You go to the pope too with the
protest to sign. If he does not sign it, that means he is against
freedom of speech. If he signs it, then show it to the government – ‘Now
you are in no danger, even the pope has signed.’ So put him in an
embarrassing situation.”</p><p><br></p><p>I would love to argue on each and every point because Christianity
has nothing worthwhile that can be supported by intelligence. That is
their fear; otherwise, a four-week tourist visa cannot destroy a church,
cannot destroy a country’s morality. And if it can be destroyed in four
weeks then it is not worth preserving, it should be destroyed. For two
thousand years, you have been creating it and a tourist for four weeks
will destroy it... that shows the quality of your morality, your
religion, your philosophy.</p><p><br></p><p>Things are coming closer to an ultimate exposure, and it is going to
be tremendously helpful because all the world governments are now caught
in a net.</p><p><br></p><p>I am going to fight every country in their own courts, and I am going
to enter every country – because nobody can prevent it without any
reason, just out of fear.</p><p><br></p><p>All these great nations are proving to be simply cowards. Question
6</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>FOR CHRISTIANS, THE GREATEST MIRACLE IS THAT JESUS COULD WALK ON
WATER.</p><p><br></p><p>AS I SAW YOU WOBBLE, ENTERING THE ROOM YESTERDAY MORNING, I HELD MY
BREATH. IS NOT THE GREATEST MIRACLE JUST THAT YOU MAKE IT TO YOUR CHAIR
WALKING ON THE ORDINARY FLOORS OF THIS HOUSE?</p><p><br></p><p>Milarepa, although you only imagine that you are enlightened, even in
your imagined enlightenment you get a few beautiful glimpses. This is
true – walking on water is just an invented story.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard that two old rabbis and one Christian bishop – all great
friends – went fishing one day on the sea of Galilee. The rabbis asked
the bishop, “Do you believe that Jesus walked on water?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Of course.” Then they said, “Can you walk then?”</p><p>That frightened him. He said, “I will walk only if you two walk first
– because you are an older religion. Jesus was a Jew. You are Jews. And
you are great rabbis.”</p><p><br></p><p>So one rabbi went out of the boat, walked twenty feet on water and
came back. The bishop could not believe his eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>The second rabbi went out, walked twenty feet and came back. The
bishop said, “My God!”</p><p><br></p><p>But now he had gathered courage... if two rabbis can walk – who are
not even Christians, and I am a follower of Christ.<span class=s4></span>He got out of the boat and as he put his first foot in
the water, he started</p><p>drowning. The two old rabbis said to each other, giggling, “Should we
tell the poor boy where the rocks are?”</p><p><br></p><p>Nobody has walked on water; you have just to know where the rocks
are.</p><p><br></p><p>But this is really a miracle every morning, Milarepa. I wake up and I
think whether I am going to make it to that goddamned chair. But somehow
or other, the miracle has continued to happen, and I think it will
continue to happen. I am completely drunk on the divine. So it is a
miracle to find the way – and that’s why my people have made the chair
red, so that I can see where it is.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part11>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

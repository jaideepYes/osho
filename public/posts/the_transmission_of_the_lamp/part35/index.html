PERHAPS THIS PROVERB IS ONE THOUSAND YEARS OLD. OSHO, WERE THERE REALLY PEOPLE ONCE WHO LIVED LIKE A FAMILY? OR WAS IT A VISION OF SOME MYSTIC, A VISION WHICH YOU ARE GOING TO BRING TO REALITY?\nThere has never been any society who has lived according to the vision of “VASUDHAIVA KUTUMBAKAM: the whole earth is one family.”\nThe mystics have been, for thousands of years, talking about it, visualizing it, but unfortunately people worship the mystics but don’t allow the mystic to transform them. Worshipping is really a way of escaping from transformation; it is saying, in other words, “You are right, but it is not time for me yet. I respect you, I worship you, and I will remember what you are saying; but I cannot act accordingly right now. I am just an ordinary human being, you are a great realized soul – the distance is vast.”\nWorshipping the mystics is not real respect. It is a strategy of the mind to avoid seeing the finger that is pointing towards the moon.\nMan is very cunning. He can crucify somebody to get rid of him, he can worship somebody to get rid of him. Crucifixion and worshipping are not different because the basic purpose is the same:\n“Just leave me alone; your stupid utopia is good, I don’t have any argument against it, but you are a special being, and I am just an ordinary creature.”\nTo prove this fact, people have called their mystics incarnations of God, messiahs, saviors, messengers. In some way they have made them so far away, they have created such a distance between themselves and the mystics, that the vision of the mystic remained a vision. It is impossible with this approach to make it a reality.\nThe first step to make such a grand vision a reality, is to realize that the mystic is just as ordinary a human being as you are. If he has realized himself, you can also realize yourself. What has become actual in him, is potential in you. What has blossomed in him, is just a seed in you. But between the seed and the flower there is no distance at all. The seed is already on the way, making every effort to become a flower.\nBut there have been two reasons denying this simple fact. One was that the masses wanted the distance; and the other was that it fulfilled the egos of many who were not really mystics, who were simply pretenders.\nTo say, yourself, that you are sent by God, is such a lie – because God is a lie, and now you are making that lie even more destructive by saying that you are a messenger, that you are a prophet. It fulfilled the egos of those who were not really realized people, so they never made any effort to destroy the distance. On the contrary, they emphasized that it was true – what was possible for them was impossible for you.\nTo prove that the distance is immense, either they fabricated miracles or after their death you added miracles in their life – because that makes the distinction very clear. You cannot do miracles, and these people were doing miracles. Certainly, they were coming from a higher order, with some spiritual power that you don’t have.\nThey also wanted that miracles should be fabricated around them; it helped their ego. It helped you also to protect yourself; otherwise you would have to transform yourself, bring something which looks impossible into reality – “Vasudhaiva kutumbakam: the whole world is one family.” Even one family is not one family. Brothers are fighting with brothers, husbands are fighting with wives, wives are fighting with husbands, children are fighting with children. Even the family is not a family – and the mystics are talking of the whole world being conceived as one family.\nSo it helped their egos to create the distance, it helped you because it seems almost impossible. Even five persons in one home cannot live peacefully; there is constant quarreling and fighting and conflict. Even the people who love each other are a pain in each other’s neck. So what possibility is there that the whole world becomes a family, a loving commune?\nSeeing the impossibility, it is better to accept that it is beyond you, it is only possible for those special beings. But the whole world is not consisting of those special beings, “so all that we can do is worship them.” That is a very sophisticated way of crucifying a person.\nA real mystic will deny it, that there is any difference, because he can see why you want the difference and the distinction.\nIn Gautam Buddha’s stories about his past lives there is one story that just before this life, when he became Gautam Buddha, he was an unconscious human being as everybody else is, and he heard about one man that had become awakened, enlightened. Everybody was going to see him. He also went to see him, with flowers to offer. He touched his feet, offered the flowers unto his feet. As he was standing up, he could not believe it; the man who was thought to be enlightened bowed down to this unconscious human being and touched his feet.\nBuddha said, “What are you doing? I am an unconscious, ordinary human being; you are an enlightened, awakened soul. Why have you touched my feet?”\nThe man laughed, and he said, “Yesterday I was also unconscious, unawakened; today I am awakened. Today you are unconscious, tomorrow you will be awakened. Remember that I touched your feet. Never forget it when you become awakened.”\nThis story is so significant. That man is saying, “I am trying to teach you that from now onward... because I can see the possibility, the potential that you will become awakened. It is only a question of time. The time does not matter – tomorrow or one life afterward. But remember that a Buddha touched your feet while you were unawakened.”\nWhat is the message? The message is, he is trying to create a bridge. He is trying to declare that awakening is not something supernatural, it is something that is intrinsic in your nature; that it is not something to do with God, it has something to do with you. It depends on you. You can go on sleeping as long as you want, and the moment you want to wake up you can wake up.\nAnd Buddha remembered it. His last words when he was dying were, “Please don’t start worshipping me. I was not here to create worshippers – there are millions of worshippers already. Don’t make statues of me; otherwise you will forget my teaching, a deviation, and you become satisfied with worshipping – which makes no difference to you. You remain the same.”\nAnd that’s exactly what people did. He died, and they started making statues and worshipping him in spite of his last words. In fact, there are more statues of Gautam Buddha in the world than of anybody else.\nThe Middle Eastern languages like Arabic and Persian don’t have another word for statue. Their word for statue is budt, and ‘budt’ has come from ‘buddha’. The statues of Buddha were so many that his name became synonymous with statue. And for twenty-five centuries people have been worshipping him. There are thousands of temples in the East. Nobody seems to be interested in the transformation he was teaching, and everybody is very enthusiastic about worshipping him.\nWorship seems to be a very subtle strategy to avoid the man.\nJews also avoided Jesus, but they used a very primitive method. Hindus have also avoided Gautam Buddha but they have used a very sophisticated method. And you can see by the results – because Jesus was crucified, and crucifixion became the source of Christianity. It is out of murder, out of violence and blood, that a religion arises. You cannot expect from Christianity anything else. In two thousand years it has killed millions of people. Its very origin was in murder, in crucifixion.\nThey have not bothered about Jesus’ teachings. He was saying, “Love your enemy like yourself.” Then I cannot understand who these people were killing. If you are going to love your enemy, are you going to kill your lovers? Enemies have to be loved, so who is to be killed – friends? No, the teaching has not been followed; only sermons were given in the churches. But enemies – and innocent enemies, who have done no harm to the ChristiansTheir only crime was that they were\nnot Christians, and they were not willing to be Christians; and that was too much, too big a crime.\nHindus used a more sophisticated method, perhaps because it was an older civilization, more cultured. They could have crucified Gautam Buddha, but they did not do that. On the contrary, they accepted Gautam Buddha as one of the incarnations of the Hindu God.\nYou will be surprised that Hindus have twenty-four incarnations of God. This number twenty-four got fixed in the mind of India. Just as there are twenty-four hours in the day – one circle is complete – one creation is one circle of millions and millions of years. In one circle of existence there are twenty-four tirthankaras; that was the Jaina concept.\nThings arise out of strange things. Every language and its arithmetic is based on ten digits, and those ten digits have come from the ten fingers – because uneducated people count on their fingers. So the first counting was done on fingers, and there are ten of them; this is just a coincidence. That’s why from one to ten the whole mathematics is complete, then it is repetition. Eleven, twelve, thirteen – that is repetition. Then you can go to millions of numbers, but they are all repetitions. The basic numbers are ten, but there is no necessity that there should be ten basic numbers.\nThere have been mathematicians like Leibnitz who worked only with three numbers – one, two, three – and managed to do every calculation. After three, four does not come because four does not exist in Leibnitz’ mathematics. After three comes ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, twenty. There is no problem – you can count that way. In the ordinary mathematics there will be four chairs in the room; Leibnitz will count ten, and it makes no difficulties, the calculations will be perfectly right.\nAlbert Einstein even tried to work with two. Just reading Leibnitz he said, “Why three?”\nThat too was another coincidence; it was because Leibnitz was a very Christian-minded person, and the trinity would be disturbed. If you bring down the numbers to less, if you make the numbers two, what will happen to the trinity? If there are only two digits, then one, two, ten, eleven. Ten will be the number, not three. To save the trinity and not to get into trouble with the pope, he kept the number three. Albert Einstein tried with number two. Two is certainly absolutely essential – you cannot work with just one – and he succeeded; with two it is possible.\nThe same kind of coincidence happened in India. Jainism, being the oldest religion, had the idea that just as a day and night make the whole circle, and then begins another day and night, another circle, it is the same with creation.one creation, then everything goes into dark night, disappears, then\nanother creation startsEach creation has twenty-four teachers; those are called tirthankaras, the\npath-makers. That is the literal meaning of tirthankara.\nBefore Jainism’s twenty-four tirthankaras became famous, Hindus had only ten incarnations of God; but then they started feeling a little poor. “Jainas have twenty-four and you have only ten?”\nIn every sphere, people are so competitive and behave so stupidly, that unless you look you will never find out how suddenly after Mahavira, because he was the most prominent Jaina tirthankara.… Although he was the last, he was the most important person in the whole range of twenty-four. Up to Mahavira, all Hindu scriptures have ten incarnations. Perhaps the fact there were ten incarnations is nothing but the result of tenfinger counting. Perhaps the reason is the same as in mathematics; and you will not be surprised that the number ten is also a Hindu concept. It was the Hindus who first brought the digit ten.\nSo it is not impossible that ten is the complete number; naturally ten incarnations are complete. You can look into your languages and you will find it. For example, all languages which are originated from Sanskrit – particularly all the languages of the developed countries of the West.The Sanskrit\nfor two is ‘dwa’, which becomes in some languages ‘twa’ and finally culminates in ‘two’.\nThe English ‘three’ comes from Sanskrit ‘tri’. The difference is so small – because in English there is no ‘dthra’ sound. The alphabet in Sanskrit is double that of English, so in English you cannot write ‘dthri’; if you write ‘dthri’ it will become ‘three’. You have to make ‘dthra’ by making ‘t-h’, joining two letters.\nThe Sanskrit for six is ‘sasth’, and you can see it is connected. For nine it is ‘nov’; and you can see it is connected. Ten was the complete number; after ten it is a repetition.\nBut once Mahavira emphasized twenty-four tirthankaras, Hindu scholars started feeling that they were a little behind. People started saying, “You have only ten tirthankaras, while Jainas have twenty-four.” So after Mahavira, Hindu scriptures started talking about twenty-four reincarnations – suddenly, with no reasoning, with no cause. Just as Mahavira died, immediately Hindu scriptures started talking about twenty-four reincarnations, just to compete with Jainism.\nIt gave them an opportunity also, and this was the opportunity – perhaps for this opportunity they made it twenty-four, or vice versa. They accepted Gautam Buddha, who was the most influential person outside the Hindu fold. They could not really crucify him – they were much more sophisticated people – but they could still crucify him in a very logical way.\nThey started a story about Buddha in their famous scriptures, the shivapuram. The story is that God made the world. He made hell and heaven; he made hell to be guarded by the devil. The devil was the king of hell, just as God was the king of heaven; the devil was his shadow, his opponent. But millions of years passed and nobody came to hell – everybody died and reached to heaven, because people were not doing anything wrong. They were not being criminals, sinners.\nThe devil was very angry, and he reached heaven and he asked God, “This is absolutely stupid! Why have you made hell? If nobody has to come there, then it is mere wastage. And my life is wasted – I am simply sitting there! You have made me the king of hell, and there is nobody in my kingdom. It is just empty space. Millions of years I have waited, and it is enough. You finish that kingdom, or start sending people. I want real people to dominate, I don’t want to sit there alone.”\nAnd God said, “Don’t be angry, you go back. I will be born as Gautam Buddha soon, and will convince people to do wrong things. And soon hell will be overcrowded.” That’s why God took an incarnation as Gautam Buddha.\nYou see the strategy: they are accepting Gautam Buddha as a Hindu incarnation of God, but the purpose is to send people to hell. So whoever follows Buddha is going to hell. And since then hell has been overcrowded. And they go on making extensions, but people are always coming in more and more. The situation has completely reversed: now very rarely does someone go to heaven. Most of the trains are going to hell.\nIn the shivapuram it is said that the crowd is so much that sometimes a few people are kept alive on the earth because they are on the waiting list. You cannot take them to heaven, and in hell there is no room; they are making room as fast as they can. So many people on the earth are on the waiting list, living just until some place is ready for them; then they will be taken there.\nThis way they have condemned Gautam Buddha’s whole teaching – that it is just to destroy people’s spirituality. And you see the effect in India: Buddhism disappeared. It was born in India, and India was immensely impressed with Gautam Buddha. There are thousands of temples and statues that show that the whole country was under his impact.\nBut Buddhism disappeared so totally that even in the most holy Buddhist place, Bodhgaya, where Gautam Buddha became enlightened – the bodhi tree is there and a temple stands as a memorial – they could not find a Buddhist priest for the temple, so a Hindu brahmin has been performing the worshipping rituals for hundreds of years. It has become a family tradition.\nI asked the man who is the priest, “How long have you been here?”\nHe said, “We have been here since this temple has been here.” Hindus created such an atmosphere that those who had started following Gautam Buddha moved back – who wants to go to hell, and hellfire – to the Hindu fold.\nI am trying to say to you that Jesus’ crucifixion made a fanatic religion of Christianity, which has been killing millions of Jews down the centuries, and their vengeance is not fulfilled.\nHindus did far better. They did not disrespect Gautam Buddha, they respected him as an incarnation of God, but managed to convince people that whoever followed him would go to hell, so not to follow him. The whole of India became completely clean of Buddhism. Buddhism spread all over Asia except in India. I used to go to their world conferences in Bodhgaya. Every nation of Asia was represented except India, because in India, Buddhism does not exist.\nYou can use crucifixion, you can use worship, and manage the same result; and sometimes worship may be a worse crucifixion than any crucifixion can be.\nThe mystics – the authentic mystics – have always tried to convince man: “There is no difference between us and you. The only difference is that you are sleeping and we have opened our eyes and we are awake – and it is not much of a difference.”\nVasudhaiva kutumbakam – ‘vasudhaiv’ means the whole earth, ‘kutumbakam’ means the family – has never been realized. One hopes that some day it will be realized.\nIt is my vision too.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nONE DAY IN AUGUST, 1985, I WAS TRYING WITH ALL MY EFFORTS TO CLEAN THE BAR OF THE DISCO IN RAJNEESHPURAM, AND I WAS SURE YOU WOULD GO THERE THAT NIGHT FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT THE “MAMA” WAS SO WORRIED THAT CLEANING BE PERFECT! WHILE I WAS EXPECTING YOU, I WAS FEELING LIKE A HOUSEWIFE EXPECTING THE HUSBAND, BUT I WAS THINKING, “THIS HUSBAND WILL NOT NAG ME, WILL NOT CRITICIZE MY WORK. HE WILL FIND EVERYTHING BEAUTIFUL.”\nAND IT HAPPENED THAT YOU ENTERED THAT SALOON SO GENTLE, SO FULL OF DIVINE CHARM; MY HEART WAS BEATING SO FAST. I HAVE TO CONFESS I WAS PRETTY ASHAMED. I WAS SURE THAT I HAD FALLEN IN LOVE WITH YOU, DEEPLY, INCURABLY.\nAND IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT IN JESUS GROVE SOME THIRTY DAYS LATER; I WAS THERE CELEBRATING YOU, AND IN MY HEART I WAS A LITTLE BIT JEALOUS OF THOSE BEAUTIFUL LONG-HAIRED GIRLS THAT USED TO DANCE WITH YOU!\nI ALWAYS HAD THE INFERIORITY COMPLEX OF BEING UGLY – AND NOW, AGED! “OH,” I WAS THINKING – NOT WITH ANGER BUT WITH SORROW – “I WOULD LIKE SO MUCH TO BE PRETTY NOW SO HE WOULD SEE ME!”\nAND WHEN I WAS NOT EXPECTING IT – SURPRISED – I SAW YOU COMING TOWARDS ME, GAZING AT ME AND DANCING AND CELEBRATING WITH ME! IT WAS AN ETERNITY – THOSE LONG, LONG MINUTES!\nOSHO, WHEN I WENT TO MY RESIDENCE THAT NIGHT, TALKING TO THE STARS, TO THE FULL MOON, I WAS SAYING, “NOW I KNOW SOMEBODY LOVES ME! I AM SURE HE LOVES! WE ARE HIS BELOVEDS, I AM SURE OF THAT!” AND THAT CERTAINLY CHANGED MY LIFE ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DEGREES. FROM THAT DAY ON I HAVE FELT WARMTH INSIDE ME – NOT THE UNCOMFORTABLE ABSENCE I USED TO HAVE BEFORE, BUT SOMETHING THAT GAVE ME EXTRA ENERGY TO LIVE AND TO SPREAD BEAUTIFUL THINGS THAT COME FROM YOU.\nOSHO, YOU ALWAYS SAY THAT WE SHOULD DROP THE ATTACHMENT TO YOU SOMEDAY, BUT THE ONLY THING I DEEPLY WISH IN MY HEART IS TO BE CLOSE TO YOU, SHARING GOOD AND BAD MOMENTS, UNTIL DEATH DO US PART.\nCAN I POSTPONE THE MOMENT OF DROPPING THE ATTACHMENT TO YOUR PRESENCE TO ANOTHER LIFE?\nYou are not aware of the dynamics of spiritual changes. I can say to you, “you can postpone,” but the more you will love me, the more you will love the whole existence, the more you will love yourself. And as that love deepens, you start disappearing. There is only love – and love is not an attachment. The attachment is of the ‘I’. Love is enough to take you away from that I.\nSo I say don’t be worried, you can postpone; don’t be afraid. Allow love to become total, and the I will disappear; and when on your part the I disappears, who is going to be attached to whom? Attachment falls of its own accord.\nAnd you have a feeling – which is in almost everybody’s heart – that when attachment disappears, love will disappear. That’s what happens in ordinary love experiences – love and attachment are almost one thing.\nBut loving me is a totally different phenomenon.\nIn the beginning the attachment will follow just out of old habit, but soon it will understand that now it is no longer needed, love is enough unto itself. And when attachment disappears, it is not that love disappears; it is for the first time that you feel its purity, its grandeur, its perfection. You are not a loser. Attachment dropped, you are victorious.\nBut it is up to you. You can postpone – about that I will not stop you – you can postpone for the next life. But don’t stop love. Get deeper into love, and it will take care of the whole thing. The attachment will go, the postponement will go. It will take away all junk that surrounds your inner space. And when there is only love, it is divine. Then it is not addressed to anyone, it is simply a fragrance available to all – to all the winds wherever they will take it.\nBut feel blissful that it has knocked on your door. And drop the idea that attachment and love are one thing. They are enemies. It is attachment that destroys all love. If you feed, if you nourish attachment, love will be destroyed; if you feed and nourish love, attachment will fall away by itself. They are not one; they are two separate entities and antagonistic to each other.\nQuestion 3 BELOVED OSHO,\nYOUR STORY THE OTHER NIGHT ABOUT THE MYSTIC WHO ASKED FOR VOLUNTEERS TO JOIN HIM IN NIRVANA PRODUCED SUCH A STRONG SENSATION IN THE ROOM!\nUSUALLY WHEN YOU SAY, “IT CAN HAPPEN NOW!” I FEEL, “I’VE GOT TO GET IT THIS TIME BECAUSE YOU’VE SAID IT SO OFTEN AND IT’S SIMPLY BEING RETARDED NOT TO GET IT.” ALONG WITH THIS FEELING THOUGH, SOMETHING IN ME RETRACTS WITH FEAR.\nTHE OTHER NIGHT I DIDN’T FEEL AFRAID AT ALL. I FORGOT ALL THE UNFINISHED EDITING, I FORGOT ALL THE QUESTIONS THAT NEED GATHERING. I EVEN FORGOT THAT YOU’VE TOLD ME NOT TO DISAPPEAR YET. I SAW THE CHANCE TO JUMP, BUT THE CHANCE DIDN’T SEE ME. COULD YOU PLEASE COMMENT?\nIt is easy to forget that I have told you not to disappear yet, but I don’t forget anything.

IS A FAMILY”. PERHAPS THIS PROVERB IS ONE THOUSAND YEARS OLD. OSHO, WERE
THERE REALLY PEOPLE ONCE WHO LIVED LIKE A FAMILY? OR WAS IT A VISION OF
SOME MYSTIC, A VISION WHICH YOU ARE GOING TO BRING TO REALITY?</p><p><br></p><p>There has never been any society who has lived according to the
vision of “VASUDHAIVA KUTUMBAKAM: the whole earth is one family.”</p><p><br></p><p>The mystics have been, for thousands of years, talking about it,
visualizing it, but unfortunately people worship the mystics but don’t
allow the mystic to transform them. Worshipping is really a way of
escaping from transformation; it is saying, in other words, “You are
right, but it is not time for me yet. I respect you, I worship you, and
I will remember what you are saying; but I cannot act accordingly right
now. I am just an ordinary human being, you are a great realized soul –
the distance is vast.”</p><p><br></p><p>Worshipping the mystics is not real respect. It is a strategy of the
mind to avoid seeing the finger that is pointing towards the moon.</p><p><br></p><p>Man is very cunning. He can crucify somebody to get rid of him, he
can worship somebody to get rid of him. Crucifixion and worshipping are
not different because the basic purpose is the same:</p><p>“Just leave me alone; your stupid utopia is good, I don’t have any
argument against it, but you are a special being, and I am just an
ordinary creature.”</p><p><br></p><p>To prove this fact, people have called their mystics incarnations of
God, messiahs, saviors, messengers. In some way they have made them so
far away, they have created such a distance between themselves and the
mystics, that the vision of the mystic remained a vision. It is
impossible with this approach to make it a reality.</p><p><br></p><p>The first step to make such a grand vision a reality, is to realize
that the mystic is just as ordinary a human being as you are. If he has
realized himself, you can also realize yourself. What has become actual
in him, is potential in you. What has blossomed in him, is just a seed
in you. But between the seed and the flower there is no distance at all.
The seed is already on the way, making every effort to become a
flower.</p><p><br></p><p>But there have been two reasons denying this simple fact. One was
that the masses wanted the distance; and the other was that it fulfilled
the egos of many who were not really mystics, who were simply
pretenders.</p><p><br></p><p>To say, yourself, that you are sent by God, is such a lie – because
God is a lie, and now you are making that lie even more destructive by
saying that you are a messenger, that you are a prophet. It fulfilled
the egos of those who were not really realized people, so they never
made any effort to destroy the distance. On the contrary, they
emphasized that it was true – what was possible for them was impossible
for you.</p><p><br></p><p>To prove that the distance is immense, either they fabricated
miracles or after their death you added miracles in their life – because
that makes the distinction very clear. You cannot do miracles, and these
people were doing miracles. Certainly, they were coming from a higher
order, with some spiritual power that you don’t have.</p><p><br></p><p>They also wanted that miracles should be fabricated around them; it
helped their ego. It helped you also to protect yourself; otherwise you
would have to transform yourself, bring something which looks impossible
into reality – “Vasudhaiva kutumbakam: the whole world is one family.”
Even one family is not one family. Brothers are fighting with brothers,
husbands are fighting with wives, wives are fighting with husbands,
children are fighting with children. Even the family is not a family –
and the mystics are talking of the whole world being conceived as one
family.</p><p><br></p><p>So it helped their egos to create the distance, it helped you because
it seems almost impossible. Even five persons in one home cannot live
peacefully; there is constant quarreling and fighting and conflict. Even
the people who love each other are a pain in each other’s neck. So what
possibility is there that the whole world becomes a family, a loving
commune?</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing the impossibility, it is better to accept that it is beyond
you, it is only possible for those special beings. But the whole world
is not consisting of those special beings, “so all that we can do is
worship them.” That is a very sophisticated way of crucifying a
person.</p><p><br></p><p>A real mystic will deny it, that there is any difference, because he
can see why you want the difference and the distinction.</p><p>In Gautam Buddha’s stories about his past lives there is one story
that just before this life, when he became Gautam Buddha, he was an
unconscious human being as everybody else is, and he heard about one man
that had become awakened, enlightened. Everybody was going to see him.
He also went to see him, with flowers to offer. He touched his feet,
offered the flowers unto his feet. As he was standing up, he could not
believe it; the man who was thought to be enlightened bowed down to this
unconscious human being and touched his feet.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha said, “What are you doing? I am an unconscious, ordinary human
being; you are an enlightened, awakened soul. Why have you touched my
feet?”</p><p><br></p><p>The man laughed, and he said, “Yesterday I was also unconscious,
unawakened; today I am awakened. Today you are unconscious, tomorrow you
will be awakened. Remember that I touched your feet. Never forget it
when you become awakened.”</p><p><br></p><p>This story is so significant. That man is saying, “I am trying to
teach you that from now onward... because I can see the possibility, the
potential that you will become awakened. It is only a question of time.
The time does not matter – tomorrow or one life afterward. But remember
that a Buddha touched your feet while you were unawakened.”</p><p><br></p><p>What is the message? The message is, he is trying to create a bridge.
He is trying to declare that awakening is not something supernatural, it
is something that is intrinsic in your nature; that it is not something
to do with God, it has something to do with you. It depends on you. You
can go on sleeping as long as you want, and the moment you want to wake
up you can wake up.</p><p><br></p><p>And Buddha remembered it. His last words when he was dying were,
“Please don’t start worshipping me. I was not here to create worshippers
– there are millions of worshippers already. Don’t make statues of me;
otherwise you will forget my teaching, a deviation, and you become
satisfied with worshipping – which makes no difference to you. You
remain the same.”</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s exactly what people did. He died, and they started making
statues and worshipping him in spite of his last words. In fact, there
are more statues of Gautam Buddha in the world than of anybody else.</p><p><br></p><p>The Middle Eastern languages like Arabic and Persian don’t have
another word for statue. Their word for statue is budt, and ‘budt’ has
come from ‘buddha’. The statues of Buddha were so many that his name
became synonymous with statue. And for twenty-five centuries people have
been worshipping him. There are thousands of temples in the East. Nobody
seems to be interested in the transformation he was teaching, and
everybody is very enthusiastic about worshipping him.</p><p><br></p><p>Worship seems to be a very subtle strategy to avoid the man.</p><p><br></p><p>Jews also avoided Jesus, but they used a very primitive method.
Hindus have also avoided Gautam Buddha but they have used a very
sophisticated method. And you can see by the results – because Jesus was
crucified, and crucifixion became the source of Christianity. It is out
of murder, out of violence and blood, that a religion arises. You cannot
expect from Christianity anything else. In two thousand years it has
killed millions of people. Its very origin was in murder, in
crucifixion.</p><p>They have not bothered about Jesus’ teachings. He was saying, “Love
your enemy like yourself.” Then I cannot understand who these people
were killing. If you are going to love your enemy, are you going to kill
your lovers? Enemies have to be loved, so who is to be killed – friends?
No, the teaching has not been followed; only sermons were given in the
churches. But enemies – and innocent enemies, who have done no harm to
the Christians<span class=s4></span>Their only crime was that they
were</p><p>not Christians, and they were not willing to be Christians; and that
was too much, too big a crime.</p><p><br></p><p>Hindus used a more sophisticated method, perhaps because it was an
older civilization, more cultured. They could have crucified Gautam
Buddha, but they did not do that. On the contrary, they accepted Gautam
Buddha as one of the incarnations of the Hindu God.</p><p><br></p><p>You will be surprised that Hindus have twenty-four incarnations of
God. This number twenty-four got fixed in the mind of India. Just as
there are twenty-four hours in the day – one circle is complete – one
creation is one circle of millions and millions of years. In one circle
of existence there are twenty-four tirthankaras; that was the Jaina
concept.</p><p><br></p><p>Things arise out of strange things. Every language and its arithmetic
is based on ten digits, and those ten digits have come from the ten
fingers – because uneducated people count on their fingers. So the first
counting was done on fingers, and there are ten of them; this is just a
coincidence. That’s why from one to ten the whole mathematics is
complete, then it is repetition. Eleven, twelve, thirteen – that is
repetition. Then you can go to millions of numbers, but they are all
repetitions. The basic numbers are ten, but there is no necessity that
there should be ten basic numbers.</p><p><br></p><p>There have been mathematicians like Leibnitz who worked only with
three numbers – one, two, three – and managed to do every calculation.
After three, four does not come because four does not exist in Leibnitz’
mathematics. After three comes ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, twenty.
There is no problem – you can count that way. In the ordinary
mathematics there will be four chairs in the room; Leibnitz will count
ten, and it makes no difficulties, the calculations will be perfectly
right.</p><p><br></p><p>Albert Einstein even tried to work with two. Just reading Leibnitz he
said, “Why three?”</p><p><br></p><p>That too was another coincidence; it was because Leibnitz was a very
Christian-minded person, and the trinity would be disturbed. If you
bring down the numbers to less, if you make the numbers two, what will
happen to the trinity? If there are only two digits, then one, two, ten,
eleven. Ten will be the number, not three. To save the trinity and not
to get into trouble with the pope, he kept the number three. Albert
Einstein tried with number two. Two is certainly absolutely essential –
you cannot work with just one – and he succeeded; with two it is
possible.</p><p><br></p><p>The same kind of coincidence happened in India. Jainism, being the
oldest religion, had the idea that just as a day and night make the
whole circle, and then begins another day and night, another circle, it
is the same with creation.<span class=s4></span>one creation, then
everything goes into dark night, disappears, then</p><p>another creation starts<span class=s4></span>Each creation has
twenty-four teachers; those are called tirthankaras, the</p><p>path-makers. That is the literal meaning of tirthankara.</p><p><br></p><p>Before Jainism’s twenty-four tirthankaras became famous, Hindus had
only ten incarnations of God; but then they started feeling a little
poor. “Jainas have twenty-four and you have only ten?”</p><p>In every sphere, people are so competitive and behave so stupidly,
that unless you look you will never find out how suddenly after
Mahavira, because he was the most prominent Jaina tirthankara.… Although
he was the last, he was the most important person in the whole range of
twenty-four. Up to Mahavira, all Hindu scriptures have ten incarnations.
Perhaps the fact there were ten incarnations is nothing but the result
of tenfinger counting. Perhaps the reason is the same as in mathematics;
and you will not be surprised that the number ten is also a Hindu
concept. It was the Hindus who first brought the digit ten.</p><p><br></p><p>So it is not impossible that ten is the complete number; naturally
ten incarnations are complete. You can look into your languages and you
will find it. For example, all languages which are originated from
Sanskrit – particularly all the languages of the developed countries of
the West.<span class=s4></span>The Sanskrit</p><p>for two is ‘dwa’, which becomes in some languages ‘twa’ and finally
culminates in ‘two’.</p><p><br></p><p>The English ‘three’ comes from Sanskrit ‘tri’. The difference is so
small – because in English there is no ‘dthra’ sound. The alphabet in
Sanskrit is double that of English, so in English you cannot write
‘dthri’; if you write ‘dthri’ it will become ‘three’. You have to make
‘dthra’ by making ‘t-h’, joining two letters.</p><p><br></p><p>The Sanskrit for six is ‘sasth’, and you can see it is connected. For
nine it is ‘nov’; and you can see it is connected. Ten was the complete
number; after ten it is a repetition.</p><p><br></p><p>But once Mahavira emphasized twenty-four tirthankaras, Hindu scholars
started feeling that they were a little behind. People started saying,
“You have only ten tirthankaras, while Jainas have twenty-four.” So
after Mahavira, Hindu scriptures started talking about twenty-four
reincarnations – suddenly, with no reasoning, with no cause. Just as
Mahavira died, immediately Hindu scriptures started talking about
twenty-four reincarnations, just to compete with Jainism.</p><p><br></p><p>It gave them an opportunity also, and this was the opportunity –
perhaps for this opportunity they made it twenty-four, or vice versa.
They accepted Gautam Buddha, who was the most influential person outside
the Hindu fold. They could not really crucify him – they were much more
sophisticated people – but they could still crucify him in a very
logical way.</p><p><br></p><p>They started a story about Buddha in their famous scriptures, the
shivapuram. The story is that God made the world. He made hell and
heaven; he made hell to be guarded by the devil. The devil was the king
of hell, just as God was the king of heaven; the devil was his shadow,
his opponent. But millions of years passed and nobody came to hell –
everybody died and reached to heaven, because people were not doing
anything wrong. They were not being criminals, sinners.</p><p><br></p><p>The devil was very angry, and he reached heaven and he asked God,
“This is absolutely stupid! Why have you made hell? If nobody has to
come there, then it is mere wastage. And my life is wasted – I am simply
sitting there! You have made me the king of hell, and there is nobody in
my kingdom. It is just empty space. Millions of years I have waited, and
it is enough. You finish that kingdom, or start sending people. I want
real people to dominate, I don’t want to sit there alone.”</p><p><br></p><p>And God said, “Don’t be angry, you go back. I will be born as Gautam
Buddha soon, and will convince people to do wrong things. And soon hell
will be overcrowded.” That’s why God took an incarnation as Gautam
Buddha.</p><p>You see the strategy: they are accepting Gautam Buddha as a Hindu
incarnation of God, but the purpose is to send people to hell. So
whoever follows Buddha is going to hell. And since then hell has been
overcrowded. And they go on making extensions, but people are always
coming in more and more. The situation has completely reversed: now very
rarely does someone go to heaven. Most of the trains are going to
hell.</p><p><br></p><p>In the shivapuram it is said that the crowd is so much that sometimes
a few people are kept alive on the earth because they are on the waiting
list. You cannot take them to heaven, and in hell there is no room; they
are making room as fast as they can. So many people on the earth are on
the waiting list, living just until some place is ready for them; then
they will be taken there.</p><p><br></p><p>This way they have condemned Gautam Buddha’s whole teaching – that it
is just to destroy people’s spirituality. And you see the effect in
India: Buddhism disappeared. It was born in India, and India was
immensely impressed with Gautam Buddha. There are thousands of temples
and statues that show that the whole country was under his impact.</p><p><br></p><p>But Buddhism disappeared so totally that even in the most holy
Buddhist place, Bodhgaya, where Gautam Buddha became enlightened – the
bodhi tree is there and a temple stands as a memorial – they could not
find a Buddhist priest for the temple, so a Hindu brahmin has been
performing the worshipping rituals for hundreds of years. It has become
a family tradition.</p><p><br></p><p>I asked the man who is the priest, “How long have you been here?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “We have been here since this temple has been here.” Hindus
created such an atmosphere that those who had started following Gautam
Buddha moved back – who wants to go to hell, and hellfire – to the Hindu
fold.</p><p><br></p><p>I am trying to say to you that Jesus’ crucifixion made a fanatic
religion of Christianity, which has been killing millions of Jews down
the centuries, and their vengeance is not fulfilled.</p><p><br></p><p>Hindus did far better. They did not disrespect Gautam Buddha, they
respected him as an incarnation of God, but managed to convince people
that whoever followed him would go to hell, so not to follow him. The
whole of India became completely clean of Buddhism. Buddhism spread all
over Asia except in India. I used to go to their world conferences in
Bodhgaya. Every nation of Asia was represented except India, because in
India, Buddhism does not exist.</p><p><br></p><p>You can use crucifixion, you can use worship, and manage the same
result; and sometimes worship may be a worse crucifixion than any
crucifixion can be.</p><p><br></p><p>The mystics – the authentic mystics – have always tried to convince
man: “There is no difference between us and you. The only difference is
that you are sleeping and we have opened our eyes and we are awake – and
it is not much of a difference.”</p><p><br></p><p>Vasudhaiva kutumbakam – ‘vasudhaiv’ means the whole earth,
‘kutumbakam’ means the family – has never been realized. One hopes that
some day it will be realized.</p><p><br></p><p>It is my vision too.</p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>ONE DAY IN AUGUST, 1985, I WAS TRYING WITH ALL MY EFFORTS TO CLEAN
THE BAR OF THE DISCO IN RAJNEESHPURAM, AND I WAS SURE YOU WOULD GO THERE
THAT NIGHT FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT THE “MAMA” WAS SO WORRIED THAT
CLEANING BE PERFECT! WHILE I WAS EXPECTING YOU, I WAS FEELING LIKE A
HOUSEWIFE EXPECTING THE HUSBAND, BUT I WAS THINKING, “THIS HUSBAND WILL
NOT NAG ME, WILL NOT CRITICIZE MY WORK. HE WILL FIND EVERYTHING
BEAUTIFUL.”</p><p><br></p><p>AND IT HAPPENED THAT YOU ENTERED THAT SALOON SO GENTLE, SO FULL OF
DIVINE CHARM; MY HEART WAS BEATING SO FAST. I HAVE TO CONFESS I WAS
PRETTY ASHAMED. I WAS SURE THAT I HAD FALLEN IN LOVE WITH YOU, DEEPLY,
INCURABLY.</p><p><br></p><p>AND IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT IN JESUS GROVE SOME THIRTY DAYS LATER; I
WAS THERE CELEBRATING YOU, AND IN MY HEART I WAS A LITTLE BIT JEALOUS OF
THOSE BEAUTIFUL LONG-HAIRED GIRLS THAT USED TO DANCE WITH YOU!</p><p><br></p><p>I ALWAYS HAD THE INFERIORITY COMPLEX OF BEING UGLY – AND NOW, AGED!
“OH,” I WAS THINKING – NOT WITH ANGER BUT WITH SORROW – “I WOULD LIKE SO
MUCH TO BE PRETTY NOW SO HE WOULD SEE ME!”</p><p><br></p><p>AND WHEN I WAS NOT EXPECTING IT – SURPRISED – I SAW YOU COMING
TOWARDS ME, GAZING AT ME AND DANCING AND CELEBRATING WITH ME! IT WAS AN
ETERNITY – THOSE LONG, LONG MINUTES!</p><p><br></p><p>OSHO, WHEN I WENT TO MY RESIDENCE THAT NIGHT, TALKING TO THE STARS,
TO THE FULL MOON, I WAS SAYING, “NOW I KNOW SOMEBODY LOVES ME! I AM SURE
HE LOVES! WE ARE HIS BELOVEDS, I AM SURE OF THAT!” AND THAT CERTAINLY
CHANGED MY LIFE ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DEGREES. FROM THAT DAY ON I HAVE
FELT WARMTH INSIDE ME – NOT THE UNCOMFORTABLE ABSENCE I USED TO HAVE
BEFORE, BUT SOMETHING THAT GAVE ME EXTRA ENERGY TO LIVE AND TO SPREAD
BEAUTIFUL THINGS THAT COME FROM YOU.</p><p><br></p><p>OSHO, YOU ALWAYS SAY THAT WE SHOULD DROP THE ATTACHMENT TO YOU
SOMEDAY, BUT THE ONLY THING I DEEPLY WISH IN MY HEART IS TO BE CLOSE TO
YOU, SHARING GOOD AND BAD MOMENTS, UNTIL DEATH DO US PART.</p><p><br></p><p>CAN I POSTPONE THE MOMENT OF DROPPING THE ATTACHMENT TO YOUR PRESENCE
TO ANOTHER LIFE?</p><p><br></p><p>You are not aware of the dynamics of spiritual changes. I can say to
you, “you can postpone,” but the more you will love me, the more you
will love the whole existence, the more you will love yourself. And as
that love deepens, you start disappearing. There is only love – and love
is not an attachment. The attachment is of the ‘I’. Love is enough to
take you away from that I.</p><p>So I say don’t be worried, you can postpone; don’t be afraid. Allow
love to become total, and the I will disappear; and when on your part
the I disappears, who is going to be attached to whom? Attachment falls
of its own accord.</p><p><br></p><p>And you have a feeling – which is in almost everybody’s heart – that
when attachment disappears, love will disappear. That’s what happens in
ordinary love experiences – love and attachment are almost one
thing.</p><p><br></p><p>But loving me is a totally different phenomenon.</p><p><br></p><p>In the beginning the attachment will follow just out of old habit,
but soon it will understand that now it is no longer needed, love is
enough unto itself. And when attachment disappears, it is not that love
disappears; it is for the first time that you feel its purity, its
grandeur, its perfection. You are not a loser. Attachment dropped, you
are victorious.</p><p><br></p><p>But it is up to you. You can postpone – about that I will not stop
you – you can postpone for the next life. But don’t stop love. Get
deeper into love, and it will take care of the whole thing. The
attachment will go, the postponement will go. It will take away all junk
that surrounds your inner space. And when there is only love, it is
divine. Then it is not addressed to anyone, it is simply a fragrance
available to all – to all the winds wherever they will take it.</p><p><br></p><p>But feel blissful that it has knocked on your door. And drop the idea
that attachment and love are one thing. They are enemies. It is
attachment that destroys all love. If you feed, if you nourish
attachment, love will be destroyed; if you feed and nourish love,
attachment will fall away by itself. They are not one; they are two
separate entities and antagonistic to each other.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 3 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>YOUR STORY THE OTHER NIGHT ABOUT THE MYSTIC WHO ASKED FOR VOLUNTEERS
TO JOIN HIM IN NIRVANA PRODUCED SUCH A STRONG SENSATION IN THE ROOM!</p><p><br></p><p>USUALLY WHEN YOU SAY, “IT CAN HAPPEN NOW!” I FEEL, “I’VE GOT TO GET
IT THIS TIME BECAUSE YOU’VE SAID IT SO OFTEN AND IT’S SIMPLY BEING
RETARDED NOT TO GET IT.” ALONG WITH THIS FEELING THOUGH, SOMETHING IN ME
RETRACTS WITH FEAR.</p><p><br></p><p>THE OTHER NIGHT I DIDN’T FEEL AFRAID AT ALL. I FORGOT ALL THE
UNFINISHED EDITING, I FORGOT ALL THE QUESTIONS THAT NEED GATHERING. I
EVEN FORGOT THAT YOU’VE TOLD ME NOT TO DISAPPEAR YET. I SAW THE CHANCE
TO JUMP, BUT THE CHANCE DIDN’T SEE ME. COULD YOU PLEASE COMMENT?</p><p><br></p><p>It is easy to forget that I have told you not to disappear yet, but I
don’t forget anything. You can drop anything you like, but you cannot
drop your editing work!</p><p>So when I say, “It can happen now,” you are not included in that!
Question 4</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>IF THE WITNESS IS BEYOND THE BODY/MIND COMPLEX, HOW IS IT THAT WHEN
THE BODY/MIND COMPLEX GOES TO SHOWER IN THE MORNING, IT DOESN’T LEAVE

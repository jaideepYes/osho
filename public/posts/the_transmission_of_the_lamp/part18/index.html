WHAT SO FAR HAS JUST BEEN AN INTELLECTUAL PERCEPTION SOMETIMES CRYSTALLIZES AS MOMENTS OF AWE AND ADMIRATION FOR EXISTENCE’S INTELLIGENCE, WHICH GOES SO FAR BEYOND OUR OWN LIMITED THINKING.\nTHE SMALL BUT SO REVEALING FACT THAT A SINGLE ELECTRON CAN DISAPPEAR AND REAPPEAR SOMEWHERE ELSE WITH NO TIME GAP – NO MATTER HOW FAR APART EVENTS HAPPEN – WAS SOMETHING LIKE A CLUE TO ME. IMAGINING IN TERMS OF ENERGY THAT NOTHING IS LOST OR DISAPPEARS, I FEEL SOMETIMES HOW THE ESSENCE OF PLANTS, ANIMALS AND HUMAN BEINGS IS INTERCONNECTED, AND JUST CHANGES FORMS ON THIS OR ANOTHER PLANET – LET’S SAY, SOME MILLIONS OF LIGHT YEARS AWAY. EVEN THE BIGGEST STARS DISSOLVE AND REAPPEAR SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THE COSMOS.\nI AM REMINDED OF THE INSIGHT OF AN ANCIENT MASTER: “AS ABOVE, SO BELOW” – OR VICE VERSA.\nCOULD YOU PLEASE TALK ABOUT THIS?\nThe ancient saying, “As above, so below,” or vice-versa, contains one of the most fundamental truths about mysticism. It means that there is no above, no below, that existence is one.\nDivisions are created by the mind. Existence is divisionless.\nDivisions are our projections, and we get so much identified with divisions that we lose contact with the whole.\nOur mind is just a small window opening towards the vast universe, but when you look always from the window, the frame of the window frames the sky outside – although there is no frame on the sky, it is frameless. But to your perception the frame of the window becomes the frame of existence.\nIt is something like... once in a while it happens to people who use glasses that they have their glasses on their nose and they are looking for them. And they have even forgotten that they cannot see without the glasses, so if they are looking and seeing, it is an absolute certainty that the glasses are in place.\nBut if you have been using glasses for years, slowly, slowly they become part of you, they become your eyes. You don’t think of them as separate from you. But each pair of glasses can give its own color to the things it sees. You are the seer behind – the glasses cannot see themselves. Things outside don’t have the color that the glass is imposing upon them, but you have become so identified with the glasses.\nI used to live with a man – he was a very nice man – who had glasses from his very childhood, and now they had become thicker and thicker. He was so accustomed to them that he would go to sleep with his glasses on. When one day I saw him sleeping with the glasses on, I woke him and said, “This is too much! Do you need these glasses for dreams? You can see dreams without glasses.”\nHe became aware that he had completely forgotten that those glasses were separate from him. For fifty years continuously they have been there, and he cannot see without them, so even to go to his bed he has to use them, and slowly, slowly, he started sleeping with his glasses on.\nHis whole world depends on his glasses: if they are green, everything will look green; if they are blue, everything will look blue; and he will believe that what he is seeing cannot be wrong.\nMan’s mind also is only an instrument. The glasses are outside the skull – the mind is inside the skull, so you cannot turn it off every day. And you are so close to it within, that the very closeness has become the identification, so that whatever the mind sees is thought to be the reality. But mind cannot see the reality; mind can see only its own prejudices. It can see its own projections displayed on the screen of the world.\nI have told you, once it happened that I was traveling from Bombay to Calcutta, and on the railway station hundreds of people had come to see me off. As the train moved, I went in. It was an air-conditioned coupe, and there was another man also in it. He simply fell flat, touched my feet.\nI said, “What are you doing? You don’t even know me.”\nHe said, “There is no need to know you when there are so many people to see you off; and many of them are very rich people of Bombay – I know them.”\nI said, “It is your joy – if it feels good, you can touch my feet – but I am a Mohammedan.”\nHe said, “My God! You are a Mohammedan? – you must be joking!” He tried hard to console himself for touching the feet of a Mohammedan. He said, “I am of the highest caste of Kashmiri brahmin. Are you really Mohammedan?”\nI said, “There is no question about it – I am saying it myself.”\nHe said, “But the people who had come to see you off, they did not look Mohammedan” – Mohammedans use special caps, a special dress, a special language – “they were all Hindus.”\nI said, “They were all Hindus, but because I can give you the number of the horse who is going to win the next race, those people, just to know who is going to win the race next time, were harassing me.”\nHe said, “My God! I will have to take a shower.” I said, “You will have to.”\nHe went, he took a shower, he changed his clothes and he came back. He said, “Is it really true?” I said, “I was just joking! I am of the highest class of Hindu.”\nHe fell at my feet again, and I said, “You don’t understand at all. I had told you that I am a Mohammedan.”\n“But,” he said, “just now you were saying.”\nI said, “I was just joking.”\nHe said, “It is so cold, and I have to take another shower. And why are you making a fool of me?” I said, “I have not done anything – you started the whole game.”\nHe went again, took a shower, came back and didn’t say anything to me; he sat in his seat and wouldn’t even look at me. But I called the servant and told him, “From my suitcase bring the SHRIMAD BHAGAVADGITA” – that is the Hindu’s bible.\nAnd the man jumped up from his corner and touched my feet. He said, “I have a certainty that you are a Hindu and just joking.”\nI said, “The night is cold, and again you have made the same mistake. And even if I am a Hindu, you need not touch my feet.”\nHe said, “How can it be? a saint who can see the future – which horse is going to come first in the raceI have to touch his feet.”\nI said, “That is your decision, but the SHRIMAD BHAGAVADGITA is really not the SHRIMAD BHAGAVADGITA.”\nHe said, “What? Then what is it?”\nI said, “What does it have to be – it is the KORAN SHARIF. There is only one book in my suitcase, and you will see – let the servant bring it.” He went to bring it: it was the KORAN SHARIF. One man had continually been at me for years that I should speak on the KORAN SHARIF, the bible of the Mohammedans. This time he had brought the best translation, just published. So I said, “Then let the book come, and you will see.”\nAnd when the book came he said, “My God, you are really a Mohammedan. I feel like killing you! – three times I have taken a cold shower, and again I have to take a cold shower. You could have simply said, ‘Bring the KORAN.’”\nI said, “This is my own way. You don’t have to dictate to me.”\nBefore taking a shower he tried to find the conductor. But the conductor was not in the compartment, so he took a shower. And while he was taking a shower the conductor came in, because the man had asked for him. I was there, I told him the whole thing. He laughed loudly. I said, “When he asks you to change the compartment and put him into some other compartment – there are seats vacant, but you simply say that those seats are booked; passengers will be getting on at the coming stations.\n“And say to that man, ‘He’s neither Mohammedan nor Hindu; he is a Christian – and in fact he is a sudra who has turned into a Christian.’” And to touch the feet of a sudra – a sudra is the lowest Hindu caste – after touching even the shadow of a sudra you have to take a bath... just the shadow!\nHe came out. Seeing the conductor he was very happy. He took him aside and he told him, “This man seems to be crazy or something. Four times I have taken a shower – and the night is getting colder and colder, and the water is ice cold. And he goes on deceiving me: he finds ways, and I get caught in them. I don’t want to go inside. You just give me a seat somewhere else.”\nThe conductor said, “What do you think he is, Mohammedan?”\nThe conductor said, “I have known him for years. He is a sudra who has turned and become a Christian.”\nThe man said, “My God, a sudra! I feel like jumping out of the train and finishing myself! Four times I have touched the feet of a sudra. Never in history has any Brahmin done that. Now I cannot go inside the compartment.”\nBut the conductor said, “I am sorry, all seats are booked. You will have to. Don’t touch his feet – he does not tell to you to. Does he tell to you to?”\nHe said, “No, he does not say anything, but he manages it in such a way that I feel like touching them.”\nThe conductor said, “Now you be alert. Now you have taken a bath, just go in. Just don’t look at him. Don’t give him any chance.”\nHe would not look at me. I tried to ask how the water was. He simply said, “Just keep quiet – because I am an angry man. You have fooled me four times. And the conductor said you are a sudra. Either I will kill myself or I will kill you.”\nI said, “I know what has happened – that conductor is such a joker! He must have told you, ‘He is a sudra. I have known him for many years and he has become converted to Christianity.’”\nHe said, “Yes, he told me.”\nI said, “You are so gullible – anybody says something, and you believe it.” So he said, “What finally have I to decide?”\nI said, “You don’t have to decide at all – just go to sleep.”\nHe said, “I cannot sleep with a sudra. And four times you have deceived me, and I am afraid you can do ANYTHING.”\nI said, “I will not do anything... but do you want the number of the horse?”\nHe said, “You have got me in your hands because that’s why I have been touching your feet and taking a cold shower. But I will take the number only if you are a high-caste Brahmin.”\nI said, “There is no question about it. Let the next station come and you will see.” me – with many flowers and garlands – and he was convinced that they were all Hindus.\nWhen I came back he was smiling and was saying, “Please forgive me. I have been telling you that you are this and that; just forgive me.” And he touched my feet again!\nI said, “You are a fool! First you should have taken the number of the horse. You have committed the same mistake again.”\nThen he freaked out, shouting all over the compartment. The conductor came, the servants came: “What is the matter?”\nHe said, “Nothing is the matter. I am a fool!” He asked the servants, “Does this man travel in the air-conditioned class often?”\nThey said, “Often – he is almost always traveling, and always in the air-conditioned class.” “And does he know anything about horse racing?”\nThose people said, “He knows nothing about horse racing! Are you talking nonsense? He talks about meditation, he talks about consciousness, But horse racing?”\nHe said, “My God, he is deceiving in that too – that those people are after him for a number. I can sleep in the corridor, but I cannot go inside the room. I cannot look at him. Seeing him, something goes wrong in me.”\nHis mind has a prejudice, and that prejudice decides every decision. He has a greed; that greed decides. But these are subjective feelings – they have nothing to do with objective reality.\nYou don’t see the world as it is. You see it as your mind forces you to see it. And this you can see all over the world – different people are conditioned in different ways, and the mind is nothing but conditioning. They see things according to their conditioning – and that conditioning is a certain color.\nWe make distinctions: We make somebody superior, somebody inferior; man is more powerful, woman is less powerful; somebody is more intelligent, somebody is less. Races have been claiming they are the chosen people of God. Every religion is claiming that their book is written by God himself. All these things, layer upon layer, make your mind; and unless you are able to put the whole mind aside and see the world directly, immediately, with your consciousness, you will never be able to see the truth.\nMind is polluted by every society for its own interests, given ideas which have no correspondence with reality, but help a certain society to feel egoistic, superior. And you cling to the mind because that mind gives superiority to you too.\nIn this world the greatest courage is to put the mind aside. The bravest man is one who can see the world without the barrier of the mind, just as it is. It is tremendously different, utterly beautiful. There is nobody who is inferior and there is nobody who is superior; there are no distinctions.\nOne Zen master, Hui Hai, was asked, “What do you think about the inferior and the superior people?”\nHe said, “Just outside my door there is a small rose bush and there is a big, one-hundred-foot-high, hundreds-of-years-old cedar, but I have never heard them talking about superiority or inferiority. The rose bush is a rose bush, the cedar is a cedar. Neither the cedar says, ‘Look! I am one hundred feet high and you are just a small bush. You don’t count. I will live for hundreds more years; many like you will come and go,’ nor does the rose bush say to the cedar, ‘Although you are so huge and so big and so ancient, you have not been able to produce a single rose flower. All your life is useless, meaningless. You have not created anything to give as an offering to existence. I am a small rose bush but look at my flowers.’\n“No, there has been no discussion. I have been hoping that some day the discussion will be there; but the rose bush is happy as it is, and the cedar is happy as it is, and there is no comparison because they are totally different. You cannot compare different things.”\nIn existence there are only unique things; no comparison is possible, no distinction is possible.\nAnd once you can see it with your own eyes, it is such a revelation, it brings such peace and benediction to your heart – that in existence there is nobody higher, nobody lower, nobody superior.\nThe biggest star... and you can conceive how big the biggest star is. Our sun is a star; it is sixty thousand times bigger than the earth, and it is considered to be a very mediocre star, a middle-class fellow. The bigger stars which you see in the night as stars are also suns; they have their own solar systems and they are thousands of times bigger than our sun. But the smallest blade of grass and the biggest star in the whole of existence are respected by life equally. They both are fulfilling some need. The world will be less if this small blade of grass is destroyed, it will be less green. And no star can replace it, take its place.\nExistence is absolutely communistic: everyone is unique and equal. All distinctions are because of our bourgeois mind. And you can go on making distinctions, as many as you want; and those distinctions have been the causes of wars. Millions of people have died for those distinctions, which do not have any relevance as far as reality is concerned.\nThe man who knows, also knows that existence is one. Its expressions are millions, but the spirit that is expressed is the same. It is one godliness with an infinite variety of creations. To see it as it is makes you free from complexes.\nAsk the psychoanalyst. Most of his patients are suffering from either an inferiority complex or a superiority complex. And you cannot convince them... it takes years; the person who suffers from an inferiority complex still goes on finding reasons why he is inferior. Somebody is more beautiful, somebody is more intelligent, somebody is richer, somebody is taller, somebody is stronger, somebody is never sick – always healthy.\nUnless you uproot the very idea of comparison it is impossible to free a man from his inferiority complex, and his inferiority complex creates competitiveness. He wants to prove that he is not inferior. In the first place he accepts that he is inferior; and then in the second place he starts fighting with the ghost – which does not exist anywhere – the idea that he is inferior. So he fights elections, he becomes a president or a prime minister; but that ghost is there, it never leaves.\nThen there are, at the other extreme, people who feel they are superior. That, too, is a disease. Because they have to prove their superiority continuously, they have to condemn everybody, criticize everybody. And it is very easy to criticize, very easy to condemn.\nTurgenev has a beautiful story. In one village there was a young man who was thought to be an idiot. The whole village treated him as an idiot. He was tired of it, but there was no way to convince the village that he was not an idiot. From where had they got the idea? And once they had got the idea they were proving it in every way... every small fault was a proof, solid proof, that the idiot could not do anything else, it was expected. If anybody else had done it, it would have been just a mistake.\nOne wandering monk was passing through the village. The boy was suffering too much. He went to the monk and asked, “What am I to do?”\nThe monk said, “I will tell you a simple formula. Practice it, and when I come back from my pilgrimage – it will take one year – then report to me what the situation is. You will be the wisest man in this town in one year’s time.”\nThe formula was simple – the young man could not believe it. He said, “Just a simple formula?”\nThe old monk said, “You simply do it. Just now go and do it, and you will see how it changes the whole thing.”\nThe formula was that if somebody says, “What a beautiful sunset,” you immediately ask, “What is beautiful in it? Prove it. Don’t talk nonsense. What evidence have you got that the sunset is beautiful? What is the criterion of beauty?” Somebody says, “That book is great.” Immediately jump on them – whether you have read it or not, that does not matter – “That is all rubbish. Who says it is great? Prove it! On what grounds? What are your arguments for its greatness?”\nJust go on criticizing, condemning any statement anybody in the town makes. You just watch and immediately jump on it, criticize it, condemn it, and ask for evidence. Nobody can prove that the sunset is beautiful. What proof is there? If somebody says to you, “This woman is beautiful,” and you say, “I don’t agree,” there is no way to convince you – because beauty is not something that can be measured, weighed; there is no criterion.\nAfter one year, when the monk came back, the people of the town met him as he was coming to the town and said, “You should see our young man, he is the wisest man we have ever seen!”\nHe said, “I know!”\nAnd that boy came, fell at the old monk’s feet and said, “You are really a miracle-maker – just such a simple formula, and the whole town asks my advice. Everybody thinks I am the most intelligent, the most learned, the most educated, the most well-read. Suddenly, in one year, I have become the wisest man of the town – and I’m really the same old idiot, nothing has changed.”\nBut it is difficult to prove that you are superior. Anybody can condemn it. What criterion have you got for your superiority?\nEven Adolf Hitler could not prove that the nordic Germans were the most superior people in the world, that they were born just to rule over the world, that in comparison to nordic Germans, everybody is sub-human – only they are superhuman. He convinced the Germans, and they enjoyed the idea. But nobody else in the whole world was convinced of this nonsense – everybody laughed.\nAnd their failure in the second world war proved that they were not born to rule over the world. Hitler killed six million people with this superiority complex – because to kill the inferior people is good for the earth, they are an unnecessary burden. But the people he was killing were Jews – who have been carrying the same idea for centuries, that they are the only chosen people of God.\nBut they have not been able to prove it to anybody else. It is impossible. You can believe it yourself, and you will suffer for it, because everybody whom you are trying to condemn, whom you are trying to make inferior, is going to be revengeful. So Jews have been tortured for four thousand years continuously. They are still tortured, but they will not leave that idea of superiority; that is their disease.\nAnd if anybody – a person like me – says, “That is your disease. Drop this idea. There is nothing wrong in being a Jew; simply drop this idea that you are the chosen few of God, because that makes the whole world your enemy,” they are not going to drop it because that is their cherished ego. They cannot prove it – they cannot drop it.\nIt is like the situation when you swallow something – you can neither swallow it nor can you take it out, it is just stuck in your throat. And you are dying because you cannot breathe. Unless your throat is cleared, you will not be able to breathe.\nThis superiority complex has destroyed the Hindus. The Hindus have the same idea – that God created them, that God has chosen them as His people, that he has given his own written book to them, that they are the highest and the purest people. Because of this nonsense, the people who were intelligent enough – even among the Hindus – went out of the Hindu fold. The Buddhists, the Jainas, they left the fold, saying, “This is an ugly idea.”\nBut the trouble is, if somebody gets some fixed idea, and there is some investment in the idea – howsoever crazy the idea may be – you cannot prove it wrong. The man may like to suffer, but he will not leave the idea. All religions do the same, all nations do the same, all races do the same.\nI am reminded of a mad man. His madness was really special: he thought that he was dead.\nFirst his family laughed, and said, “This is the most outrageous thing one can think of. You are alive – you argue about your being dead. That is enough proof that you are alive.”\nBut there was no way to convince the man. He would not go to the shop. He would wake up when he wanted, he would go to sleep when he wanted. He said, “What can I do? You cannot control a dead man’s behavior. I am dead.”\nFinally they took him to a psychoanalyst. The psychoanalyst said, “Don’t be worried, I have cured many cases – leave him with me.” First he tried to tell him, “You are not dead. You have walked here and you are sitting here on the chair. How can you be dead?”\nHe said, “Where is it written that dead people don’t walk?” Even the psychoanalyst was at a loss! The man said, “Show me some evidence, where it is written that dead people don’t walk, that they don’t sit on chairs, that they don’t talk. I am a living proof that dead people can walk.”\nThe psychoanalyst saw that the man seemed to be difficult! He took out a paper knife and just cut the man’s hand a little so blood came out. And before cutting his hand he asked the man, “What do you think: do dead men bleed?”\nThe man said, “I have heard that they do not bleed.”\nSo he cut his hand and blood came out. The psychoanalyst was very happy and he laughed. He said, “Now, what do you say?”\nThe man said, “That simply means that that proverb is wrong. Dead men do bleed – the proof is here.” Once you get identified with a certain idea, then you are sick.\nAll identification is mental sickness. In fact, mind is your sickness.\nAnd to put the mind aside and just to look silently – without any thought, without any prejudice – into reality is a healthy way of being acquainted with reality. And you will find a totally different reality.\nThe finding of the real will release you from many stupidities, many superstitions. It will clean your heart of all kinds of rubbish that generations have poured into you. Diseases go on from generation to generation; you inherit the whole past with all its stupid ideas. Otherwise, there would be no distinction, there is no comparison.\nAnd once you are free from making comparisons and distinctions, you are light, your whole existence is light. You lose all heaviness. You become so light that you can open your wings and fly.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nYOU SEEM TO HAVE RETAINED, OR REGAINED, FROM YOUR CHILDHOOD, A CAPACITY TO DREAM – SOMETHING WHICH PROBABLY ALMOST ALL OF US BEGIN LIFE WITH, BUT WHICH, BY AND BY, BECOMES ERODED WITH CYNICISM AND THE FEAR OF BEING THOUGHT NAIVE AND UNWORLDLY.\nI LOVE WATCHING YOU WHEN YOU TALK OF A COMMUNE IN THE SKY, FLOATING VEGETABLE GARDENS AROUND AN ISLAND-BASED CITY OF SANNYASINS, A MYSTERY SCHOOL ASAIL THE HIGH SEAS: YOUR EYES OPEN WIDE, AND WHATEVER YOU SAY – HOWEVER OFF-THE-WALL – ALWAYS SEEMS ABSOLUTELY POSSIBLE, AND I CAN NEVER BRING MYSELF TO LAUGH BECAUSE I ADORE THIS ABILITY IN YOU.\nI CAN SEE THAT THIS FACULTY ALONE IS ENOUGH TO DRIVE THE POLITICIANS AND RELIGIOUS LEADERS ALL OVER THE WORLD, NUTS.

IT IS AS IF THE VALUE LIES IN THE ABILITY TO DREAM – NOT IN WHETHER THE DREAM IS REALIZED OR NOT.\nIF THE MINDS OF THOSE AROUND YOU HAD THEIR SAY, WE WOULD FIND OURSELVES CONFINED TO THE FEEBLE MUTTERINGS OF THE MEDIOCRE, THE SAFE, THE CERTAIN. BUT IT IS AS IF YOU ARE SITTING IN THE FRONT SEAT OF A ROLLER COASTER, AND WE, THE PASSENGERS, ARE BEHIND YOU. THE HEIGHTS ARE SO DIZZYING, THE PACE, SO EXHILARATING, THE JOY, SO ADDICTIVE, THAT ONE FEELS, “HANG THE EXPENSE – I’M GOING WHEREVER THIS JOKER TAKES ME!”\nIt is possible that to you it may seem that I have retained the small child’s capacity to dream. But that is not the reality. I have certainly retained the innocence of the child, but anything that I have said, or done, or will do, is not a dream; and it is never “off-the-wall.” It looks off-the-wall because you think in very utilitarian terms.\nI am not a utilitarian. I am a poet, who does not compose poetry, who composes living beings. My effort is not to materialize a dream – I don’t have any dream – but to help you to see that your utilitarian life is not all: that much more is possible, it is just that you have not dared to cross the mundane line; that everything is possible, you just have to gather courage.\nAnd courage with innocence makes you capable of being a visionary, not a dreamer – and there is a great difference between dream and vision.\nDreams happen while you are asleep. They are part and parcel of our spiritual sleep. A vision is the equivalent when you are fully awake. Then you can see things which to others may look off-the-wall, but to you they are just in the tomorrow. The day after tomorrow, just a question of a little time, and they will be realities.\nThe politicians and the religious leaders are afraid because they know that whatever I am saying is going to happen. All their efforts are against the current. They can make a little delay, but they are moving against the current.\nFor example, my vision of ocean cities is going to happen – whether we make the first ocean city or somebody else makes it. But the earth is becoming smaller, and the population is becoming bigger. Except for the ocean there is no place where these people are going to live. And if the whole world becomes full of people, houses, roads, then where are you going to produce food?\nI am a very realistic person, not a dreamer. When I say ocean cities I speak of a simple reality: If all the people of the world move to ocean cities, around the earth, and the whole earth is used for production – for food, for vegetables, for everything else – we can support a bigger population than is present today, without any difficulty.\nThe ocean also has an infinite capacity for providing food, which has not been explored. It grows a certain kind of vegetation, deep down, thousands of feet down, that can be used as food. And it has been found in experiments that it is full of the vital elements needed for food. And this is simply wild growth. We can manage – just the way we have managed on the earth – to grow food underneath the oceans.\nOnce man was a hunter, and he never thought that he would live in cities, and that he would not be a hunter, but a farmer, a shopper, a professor. For millions of years man remained a hunter, but a time came when the population became too much, and it became difficult to survive through hunting. Then some visionary must have given the idea: “We have not used the fruits which are growing all around. To support a greater population, use fruits.”\nThen somebody else may have given the vision: “Why just use wild fruits? We can cultivate food. Just watching nature, how these fruits fall, how new trees grow out of the seeds... we can manage it better than nature – we are nature’s conscious hand.” Cultivation came in.\nAnd that’s how, slowly, slowly, man has developed things. But first it was always a vision, and people laughed at it, because they were only accustomed to the past, the old way. But the old way had come to an end – something had to be done. So these visionaries who appeared to be off-the-wall had to be listened to. Unwillingly, reluctantly, people followed them and found that they were right: we\ncultivated the whole earth. Now the earth is in a situation where it cannot feed the whole population sufficiently. The ocean is available. Life can be shifted to the oceans very easily.\nJust last night I was asking Jay – because I am planning for it – about the platforms which people use in wartime for their aircraft. Huge platforms floating in the ocean are used for hundreds of planes to land and take off. And underneath the platform, five or six thousand people can live; they have cabins underneath the platform.\nI loved the idea. Just one platform, and five or six thousand people, with all the luxuries: with television, with telephone, with radio, and your own airport on top of you – a meeting place, a mandir. And there is no problem, it simply just has to be done. One person does it, and you will see many others following.\nAnd the tremendous silence of the ocean... and you are under no government; just twelve miles off shore and you are really free. No government is over you, and you can prove that six thousand people can live without any government, without any police, without any courts, without any legal experts – without all that paraphernalia – in immense harmony.\nAnd on the huge platform you can make lawns, you can make gardens; you can have the beauty of the earth too. So you are not closed up in the cabins; you can come out on the platform, and you have miles of tennis courts, a golf course, swimming pools, lawns, beautiful trees. All this can be managed on the platform. If it can keep hundreds of planes, it can easily bear the weight of earth that we will bring to it and the trees. And you can get your food from the nearby port. Small boats can go and come for your food and your daily needs.\nThe idea can become a world-wide phenomenon. It is not a dream. Once people see that it works, then around the earth there can be many cities, vacating the earth for production. People can go in the day to work on the earth, and at evening come home to the ocean. And it seems to me very logical: man was born in the ocean, and perhaps it is time to come back home.\nI don’t see it as a dream; it is just a reality which has to be dared. And it is always that somebody has to be the pioneer; then others will follow. Then for them there is no difficulty, they can see that people are living beautifully. A whole university can float; there is no need for them to destroy the earth with their campuses.\nFinally, if we exhaust the ocean too – which will take many thousands of years – there is always a possibility of having floating cities in the sky. All scientific facts are available on how a city can be floated in the air. People will be coming to the earth for production and taking their production back, but they will be living high in the sky.\nAnd these should be adventures, great ecstasies for people, rather than starving and dying like in Ethiopia – one thousand people dying and starving every day, and nobody has any idea what to do.\nWhen I started speaking in India the population was only four hundred million. And I was from the very beginning for birth control; I was condemned because religions are against it. I was for the pill; I was stoned, efforts were made to kill me, because I was “destroying their morality.”\nIf they had listened to me they would not be in such a trouble. Now the population is nine hundred million – more than double. And by the end of this century, India will have a population of one billion, eight hundred million.\nThere is no possible way to feed this population – these people are going to die. Fifty percent of the people will be dying, and when fifty percent of people die, you can understand what will happen to the remaining fifty percent: they will be living in a graveyard. Everywhere will be corpses. Nobody will be there to burn them.\nIt is not my dream. I have all the facts from scientific experiments, that cities can be floated in the sky: but for that, the time has not come.\nBut for cities in the ocean the time has come, and it is particularly a blessing that existence has given us the chance to be the pioneers – because no country will accept me and my people, but the ocean belongs to no country.\nWe are going to do it. And only when you see with your own eyes, only when you are living on the ocean, then will you understand that it was not a dream, that it was a vision.\nDreams cannot be fulfilled – dreams are unconscious. Visions are conscious. Dreams happen to all sleeping people; visions happen only when you are awakened. A vision is a reality that can be managed; you just have to have courageous people with you. And I have the best, the most intelligent, the most courageous people with me.\nNever think anything I say is off-the-wall. It may appear to be to you – that is just because you compare it with the old, trodden path. I see it happening.\nSo just wait a little and you will be on the ocean.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"6461","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_transmission_of_the_lamp/part18/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_transmission_of_the_lamp/>The Transmission of the Lamp</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">18 You just have to gather courage</h1><div class=post-meta>31 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;6461 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Transmission_of_the_Lamp/part18.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part17>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

EVERYTHING THAT EXISTS – THAT NOBODY AND NOTHING IS AN ISLAND, SOMETHING
IS DAWNING IN ME WHICH I CAN HARDLY PUT INTO WORDS. WHAT SO FAR HAS JUST
BEEN AN INTELLECTUAL PERCEPTION SOMETIMES CRYSTALLIZES AS MOMENTS OF AWE
AND ADMIRATION FOR EXISTENCE’S INTELLIGENCE, WHICH GOES SO FAR BEYOND
OUR OWN LIMITED THINKING.</p><p><br></p><p>THE SMALL BUT SO REVEALING FACT THAT A SINGLE ELECTRON CAN DISAPPEAR
AND REAPPEAR SOMEWHERE ELSE WITH NO TIME GAP – NO MATTER HOW FAR APART
EVENTS HAPPEN – WAS SOMETHING LIKE A CLUE TO ME. IMAGINING IN TERMS OF
ENERGY THAT NOTHING IS LOST OR DISAPPEARS, I FEEL SOMETIMES HOW THE
ESSENCE OF PLANTS, ANIMALS AND HUMAN BEINGS IS INTERCONNECTED, AND JUST
CHANGES FORMS ON THIS OR ANOTHER PLANET – LET’S SAY, SOME MILLIONS OF
LIGHT YEARS AWAY. EVEN THE BIGGEST STARS DISSOLVE AND REAPPEAR SOMEWHERE
ELSE IN THE COSMOS.</p><p><br></p><p>I AM REMINDED OF THE INSIGHT OF AN ANCIENT MASTER: “AS ABOVE, SO
BELOW” – OR VICE VERSA.</p><p><br></p><p>COULD YOU PLEASE TALK ABOUT THIS?</p><p>The ancient saying, “As above, so below,” or vice-versa, contains one
of the most fundamental truths about mysticism. It means that there is
no above, no below, that existence is one.</p><p><br></p><p>Divisions are created by the mind. Existence is divisionless.</p><p>Divisions are our projections, and we get so much identified with
divisions that we lose contact with the whole.</p><p><br></p><p>Our mind is just a small window opening towards the vast universe,
but when you look always from the window, the frame of the window frames
the sky outside – although there is no frame on the sky, it is
frameless. But to your perception the frame of the window becomes the
frame of existence.</p><p><br></p><p>It is something like... once in a while it happens to people who use
glasses that they have their glasses on their nose and they are looking
for them. And they have even forgotten that they cannot see without the
glasses, so if they are looking and seeing, it is an absolute certainty
that the glasses are in place.</p><p><br></p><p>But if you have been using glasses for years, slowly, slowly they
become part of you, they become your eyes. You don’t think of them as
separate from you. But each pair of glasses can give its own color to
the things it sees. You are the seer behind – the glasses cannot see
themselves. Things outside don’t have the color that the glass is
imposing upon them, but you have become so identified with the
glasses.</p><p><br></p><p>I used to live with a man – he was a very nice man – who had glasses
from his very childhood, and now they had become thicker and thicker. He
was so accustomed to them that he would go to sleep with his glasses on.
When one day I saw him sleeping with the glasses on, I woke him and
said, “This is too much! Do you need these glasses for dreams? You can
see dreams without glasses.”</p><p><br></p><p>He became aware that he had completely forgotten that those glasses
were separate from him. For fifty years continuously they have been
there, and he cannot see without them, so even to go to his bed he has
to use them, and slowly, slowly, he started sleeping with his glasses
on.</p><p><br></p><p>His whole world depends on his glasses: if they are green, everything
will look green; if they are blue, everything will look blue; and he
will believe that what he is seeing cannot be wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>Man’s mind also is only an instrument. The glasses are outside the
skull – the mind is inside the skull, so you cannot turn it off every
day. And you are so close to it within, that the very closeness has
become the identification, so that whatever the mind sees is thought to
be the reality. But mind cannot see the reality; mind can see only its
own prejudices. It can see its own projections displayed on the screen
of the world.</p><p><br></p><p>I have told you, once it happened that I was traveling from Bombay to
Calcutta, and on the railway station hundreds of people had come to see
me off. As the train moved, I went in. It was an air-conditioned coupe,
and there was another man also in it. He simply fell flat, touched my
feet.</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “What are you doing? You don’t even know me.”</p><p>He said, “There is no need to know you when there are so many people
to see you off; and many of them are very rich people of Bombay – I know
them.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “It is your joy – if it feels good, you can touch my feet –
but I am a Mohammedan.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “My God! You are a Mohammedan? – you must be joking!” He
tried hard to console himself for touching the feet of a Mohammedan. He
said, “I am of the highest caste of Kashmiri brahmin. Are you really
Mohammedan?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “There is no question about it – I am saying it myself.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “But the people who had come to see you off, they did not
look Mohammedan” – Mohammedans use special caps, a special dress, a
special language – “they were all Hindus.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “They were all Hindus, but because I can give you the number
of the horse who is going to win the next race, those people, just to
know who is going to win the race next time, were harassing me.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “My God! I will have to take a shower.” I said, “You will
have to.”</p><p>He went, he took a shower, he changed his clothes and he came back.
He said, “Is it really true?” I said, “I was just joking! I am of the
highest class of Hindu.”</p><p>He fell at my feet again, and I said, “You don’t understand at all. I
had told you that I am a Mohammedan.<span class=s4></span>”</p><p><br></p><p>“But,” he said, “just now you were saying.<span class=s4></span>”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I was just joking.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “It is so cold, and I have to take another shower. And why
are you making a fool of me?” I said, “I have not done anything – you
started the whole game.”</p><p>He went again, took a shower, came back and didn’t say anything to
me; he sat in his seat and wouldn’t even look at me. But I called the
servant and told him, “From my suitcase bring the SHRIMAD BHAGAVADGITA”
– that is the Hindu’s bible.</p><p><br></p><p>And the man jumped up from his corner and touched my feet. He said,
“I have a certainty that you are a Hindu and just joking.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “The night is cold, and again you have made the same mistake.
And even if I am a Hindu, you need not touch my feet.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “How can it be? a saint who can see the future – which horse
is going to come first in the race<span class=s4></span>I have to
touch his feet.”</p><p>I said, “That is your decision, but the SHRIMAD BHAGAVADGITA is
really not the SHRIMAD BHAGAVADGITA.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “What? Then what is it?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “What does it have to be – it is the KORAN SHARIF. There is
only one book in my suitcase, and you will see – let the servant bring
it.” He went to bring it: it was the KORAN SHARIF. One man had
continually been at me for years that I should speak on the KORAN
SHARIF, the bible of the Mohammedans. This time he had brought the best
translation, just published. So I said, “Then let the book come, and you
will see.”</p><p><br></p><p>And when the book came he said, “My God, you are really a Mohammedan.
I feel like killing you! – three times I have taken a cold shower, and
again I have to take a cold shower. You could have simply said, ‘Bring
the KORAN.’”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “This is my own way. You don’t have to dictate to me.”</p><p><br></p><p>Before taking a shower he tried to find the conductor. But the
conductor was not in the compartment, so he took a shower. And while he
was taking a shower the conductor came in, because the man had asked for
him. I was there, I told him the whole thing. He laughed loudly. I said,
“When he asks you to change the compartment and put him into some other
compartment – there are seats vacant, but you simply say that those
seats are booked; passengers will be getting on at the coming
stations.</p><p><br></p><p>“And say to that man, ‘He’s neither Mohammedan nor Hindu; he is a
Christian – and in fact he is a sudra who has turned into a Christian.’”
And to touch the feet of a sudra – a sudra is the lowest Hindu caste –
after touching even the shadow of a sudra you have to take a bath...
just the shadow!</p><p><br></p><p>He came out. Seeing the conductor he was very happy. He took him
aside and he told him, “This man seems to be crazy or something. Four
times I have taken a shower – and the night is getting colder and
colder, and the water is ice cold. And he goes on deceiving me: he finds
ways, and I get caught in them. I don’t want to go inside. You just give
me a seat somewhere else.”</p><p><br></p><p>The conductor said, “What do you think he is, Mohammedan?”</p><p><br></p><p>The conductor said, “I have known him for years. He is a sudra who
has turned and become a Christian.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man said, “My God, a sudra! I feel like jumping out of the train
and finishing myself! Four times I have touched the feet of a sudra.
Never in history has any Brahmin done that. Now I cannot go inside the
compartment.”</p><p><br></p><p>But the conductor said, “I am sorry, all seats are booked. You will
have to. Don’t touch his feet – he does not tell to you to. Does he tell
to you to?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “No, he does not say anything, but he manages it in such a
way that I feel like touching them.”</p><p>The conductor said, “Now you be alert. Now you have taken a bath,
just go in. Just don’t look at him. Don’t give him any chance.”</p><p><br></p><p>He would not look at me. I tried to ask how the water was. He simply
said, “Just keep quiet – because I am an angry man. You have fooled me
four times. And the conductor said you are a sudra. Either I will kill
myself or I will kill you.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I know what has happened – that conductor is such a joker!
He must have told you, ‘He is a sudra. I have known him for many years
and he has become converted to Christianity.’”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Yes, he told me.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “You are so gullible – anybody says something, and you
believe it.” So he said, “What finally have I to decide?”</p><p>I said, “You don’t have to decide at all – just go to sleep.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I cannot sleep with a sudra. And four times you have
deceived me, and I am afraid you can do ANYTHING.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “I will not do anything... but do you want the number of the
horse?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “You have got me in your hands because that’s why I have
been touching your feet and taking a cold shower. But I will take the
number only if you are a high-caste Brahmin.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “There is no question about it. Let the next station come and
you will see.” me – with many flowers and garlands – and he was
convinced that they were all Hindus.</p><p><br></p><p>When I came back he was smiling and was saying, “Please forgive me. I
have been telling you that you are this and that; just forgive me.” And
he touched my feet again!</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “You are a fool! First you should have taken the number of
the horse. You have committed the same mistake again.”</p><p><br></p><p>Then he freaked out, shouting all over the compartment. The conductor
came, the servants came: “What is the matter?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Nothing is the matter. I am a fool!” He asked the servants,
“Does this man travel in the air-conditioned class often?”</p><p><br></p><p>They said, “Often – he is almost always traveling, and always in the
air-conditioned class.” “And does he know anything about horse
racing?”</p><p>Those people said, “He knows nothing about horse racing! Are you
talking nonsense? He talks about meditation, he talks about
consciousness, But horse racing?”</p><p>He said, “My God, he is deceiving in that too – that those people are
after him for a number. I can sleep in the corridor, but I cannot go
inside the room. I cannot look at him. Seeing him, something goes wrong
in me.”</p><p><br></p><p>His mind has a prejudice, and that prejudice decides every decision.
He has a greed; that greed decides. But these are subjective feelings –
they have nothing to do with objective reality.</p><p><br></p><p>You don’t see the world as it is. You see it as your mind forces you
to see it. And this you can see all over the world – different people
are conditioned in different ways, and the mind is nothing but
conditioning. They see things according to their conditioning – and that
conditioning is a certain color.</p><p><br></p><p>We make distinctions: We make somebody superior, somebody inferior;
man is more powerful, woman is less powerful; somebody is more
intelligent, somebody is less. Races have been claiming they are the
chosen people of God. Every religion is claiming that their book is
written by God himself. All these things, layer upon layer, make your
mind; and unless you are able to put the whole mind aside and see the
world directly, immediately, with your consciousness, you will never be
able to see the truth.</p><p><br></p><p>Mind is polluted by every society for its own interests, given ideas
which have no correspondence with reality, but help a certain society to
feel egoistic, superior. And you cling to the mind because that mind
gives superiority to you too.</p><p><br></p><p>In this world the greatest courage is to put the mind aside. The
bravest man is one who can see the world without the barrier of the
mind, just as it is. It is tremendously different, utterly beautiful.
There is nobody who is inferior and there is nobody who is superior;
there are no distinctions.</p><p><br></p><p>One Zen master, Hui Hai, was asked, “What do you think about the
inferior and the superior people?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Just outside my door there is a small rose bush and there
is a big, one-hundred-foot-high, hundreds-of-years-old cedar, but I have
never heard them talking about superiority or inferiority. The rose bush
is a rose bush, the cedar is a cedar. Neither the cedar says, ‘Look! I
am one hundred feet high and you are just a small bush. You don’t count.
I will live for hundreds more years; many like you will come and go,’
nor does the rose bush say to the cedar, ‘Although you are so huge and
so big and so ancient, you have not been able to produce a single rose
flower. All your life is useless, meaningless. You have not created
anything to give as an offering to existence. I am a small rose bush but
look at my flowers.’</p><p><br></p><p>“No, there has been no discussion. I have been hoping that some day
the discussion will be there; but the rose bush is happy as it is, and
the cedar is happy as it is, and there is no comparison because they are
totally different. You cannot compare different things.”</p><p><br></p><p>In existence there are only unique things; no comparison is possible,
no distinction is possible.</p><p><br></p><p>And once you can see it with your own eyes, it is such a revelation,
it brings such peace and benediction to your heart – that in existence
there is nobody higher, nobody lower, nobody superior.</p><p>The biggest star... and you can conceive how big the biggest star is.
Our sun is a star; it is sixty thousand times bigger than the earth, and
it is considered to be a very mediocre star, a middle-class fellow. The
bigger stars which you see in the night as stars are also suns; they
have their own solar systems and they are thousands of times bigger than
our sun. But the smallest blade of grass and the biggest star in the
whole of existence are respected by life equally. They both are
fulfilling some need. The world will be less if this small blade of
grass is destroyed, it will be less green. And no star can replace it,
take its place.</p><p><br></p><p>Existence is absolutely communistic: everyone is unique and equal.
All distinctions are because of our bourgeois mind. And you can go on
making distinctions, as many as you want; and those distinctions have
been the causes of wars. Millions of people have died for those
distinctions, which do not have any relevance as far as reality is
concerned.</p><p><br></p><p>The man who knows, also knows that existence is one. Its expressions
are millions, but the spirit that is expressed is the same. It is one
godliness with an infinite variety of creations. To see it as it is
makes you free from complexes.</p><p><br></p><p>Ask the psychoanalyst. Most of his patients are suffering from either
an inferiority complex or a superiority complex. And you cannot convince
them... it takes years; the person who suffers from an inferiority
complex still goes on finding reasons why he is inferior. Somebody is
more beautiful, somebody is more intelligent, somebody is richer,
somebody is taller, somebody is stronger, somebody is never sick –
always healthy.</p><p><br></p><p>Unless you uproot the very idea of comparison it is impossible to
free a man from his inferiority complex, and his inferiority complex
creates competitiveness. He wants to prove that he is not inferior. In
the first place he accepts that he is inferior; and then in the second
place he starts fighting with the ghost – which does not exist anywhere
– the idea that he is inferior. So he fights elections, he becomes a
president or a prime minister; but that ghost is there, it never
leaves.</p><p><br></p><p>Then there are, at the other extreme, people who feel they are
superior. That, too, is a disease. Because they have to prove their
superiority continuously, they have to condemn everybody, criticize
everybody. And it is very easy to criticize, very easy to condemn.</p><p><br></p><p>Turgenev has a beautiful story. In one village there was a young man
who was thought to be an idiot. The whole village treated him as an
idiot. He was tired of it, but there was no way to convince the village
that he was not an idiot. From where had they got the idea? And once
they had got the idea they were proving it in every way... every small
fault was a proof, solid proof, that the idiot could not do anything
else, it was expected. If anybody else had done it, it would have been
just a mistake.</p><p><br></p><p>One wandering monk was passing through the village. The boy was
suffering too much. He went to the monk and asked, “What am I to
do?”</p><p><br></p><p>The monk said, “I will tell you a simple formula. Practice it, and
when I come back from my pilgrimage – it will take one year – then
report to me what the situation is. You will be the wisest man in this
town in one year’s time.”</p><p><br></p><p>The formula was simple – the young man could not believe it. He said,
“Just a simple formula?”</p><p>The old monk said, “You simply do it. Just now go and do it, and you
will see how it changes the whole thing.”</p><p><br></p><p>The formula was that if somebody says, “What a beautiful sunset,” you
immediately ask, “What is beautiful in it? Prove it. Don’t talk
nonsense. What evidence have you got that the sunset is beautiful? What
is the criterion of beauty?” Somebody says, “That book is great.”
Immediately jump on them – whether you have read it or not, that does
not matter – “That is all rubbish. Who says it is great? Prove it! On
what grounds? What are your arguments for its greatness?”</p><p><br></p><p>Just go on criticizing, condemning any statement anybody in the town
makes. You just watch and immediately jump on it, criticize it, condemn
it, and ask for evidence. Nobody can prove that the sunset is beautiful.
What proof is there? If somebody says to you, “This woman is beautiful,”
and you say, “I don’t agree,” there is no way to convince you – because
beauty is not something that can be measured, weighed; there is no
criterion.</p><p><br></p><p>After one year, when the monk came back, the people of the town met
him as he was coming to the town and said, “You should see our young
man, he is the wisest man we have ever seen!”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I know!”</p><p><br></p><p>And that boy came, fell at the old monk’s feet and said, “You are
really a miracle-maker – just such a simple formula, and the whole town
asks my advice. Everybody thinks I am the most intelligent, the most
learned, the most educated, the most well-read. Suddenly, in one year, I
have become the wisest man of the town – and I’m really the same old
idiot, nothing has changed.”</p><p><br></p><p>But it is difficult to prove that you are superior. Anybody can
condemn it. What criterion have you got for your superiority?</p><p><br></p><p>Even Adolf Hitler could not prove that the nordic Germans were the
most superior people in the world, that they were born just to rule over
the world, that in comparison to nordic Germans, everybody is sub-human
– only they are superhuman. He convinced the Germans, and they enjoyed
the idea. But nobody else in the whole world was convinced of this
nonsense – everybody laughed.</p><p><br></p><p>And their failure in the second world war proved that they were not
born to rule over the world. Hitler killed six million people with this
superiority complex – because to kill the inferior people is good for
the earth, they are an unnecessary burden. But the people he was killing
were Jews – who have been carrying the same idea for centuries, that
they are the only chosen people of God.</p><p><br></p><p>But they have not been able to prove it to anybody else. It is
impossible. You can believe it yourself, and you will suffer for it,
because everybody whom you are trying to condemn, whom you are trying to
make inferior, is going to be revengeful. So Jews have been tortured for
four thousand years continuously. They are still tortured, but they will
not leave that idea of superiority; that is their disease.</p><p><br></p><p>And if anybody – a person like me – says, “That is your disease. Drop
this idea. There is nothing wrong in being a Jew; simply drop this idea
that you are the chosen few of God, because that makes the whole world
your enemy,” they are not going to drop it because that is their
cherished ego. They cannot prove it – they cannot drop it.</p><p>It is like the situation when you swallow something – you can neither
swallow it nor can you take it out, it is just stuck in your throat. And
you are dying because you cannot breathe. Unless your throat is cleared,
you will not be able to breathe.</p><p><br></p><p>This superiority complex has destroyed the Hindus. The Hindus have
the same idea – that God created them, that God has chosen them as His
people, that he has given his own written book to them, that they are
the highest and the purest people. Because of this nonsense, the people
who were intelligent enough – even among the Hindus – went out of the
Hindu fold. The Buddhists, the Jainas, they left the fold, saying, “This
is an ugly idea.”</p><p><br></p><p>But the trouble is, if somebody gets some fixed idea, and there is
some investment in the idea – howsoever crazy the idea may be – you
cannot prove it wrong. The man may like to suffer, but he will not leave
the idea. All religions do the same, all nations do the same, all races
do the same.</p><p><br></p><p>I am reminded of a mad man. His madness was really special: he
thought that he was dead.</p><p><br></p><p>First his family laughed, and said, “This is the most outrageous
thing one can think of. You are alive – you argue about your being dead.
That is enough proof that you are alive.”</p><p><br></p><p>But there was no way to convince the man. He would not go to the
shop. He would wake up when he wanted, he would go to sleep when he
wanted. He said, “What can I do? You cannot control a dead man’s
behavior. I am dead.”</p><p><br></p><p>Finally they took him to a psychoanalyst. The psychoanalyst said,
“Don’t be worried, I have cured many cases – leave him with me.” First
he tried to tell him, “You are not dead. You have walked here and you
are sitting here on the chair. How can you be dead?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Where is it written that dead people don’t walk?” Even the
psychoanalyst was at a loss! The man said, “Show me some evidence, where
it is written that dead people don’t walk, that they don’t sit on
chairs, that they don’t talk. I am a living proof that dead people can
walk.”</p><p><br></p><p>The psychoanalyst saw that the man seemed to be difficult! He took
out a paper knife and just cut the man’s hand a little so blood came
out. And before cutting his hand he asked the man, “What do you think:
do dead men bleed?”</p><p><br></p><p>The man said, “I have heard that they do not bleed.”</p><p><br></p><p>So he cut his hand and blood came out. The psychoanalyst was very
happy and he laughed. He said, “Now, what do you say?”</p><p><br></p><p>The man said, “That simply means that that proverb is wrong. Dead men
do bleed – the proof is here.” Once you get identified with a certain
idea, then you are sick.</p><p><br></p><p>All identification is mental sickness. In fact, mind is your
sickness.</p><p>And to put the mind aside and just to look silently – without any
thought, without any prejudice – into reality is a healthy way of being
acquainted with reality. And you will find a totally different
reality.</p><p><br></p><p>The finding of the real will release you from many stupidities, many
superstitions. It will clean your heart of all kinds of rubbish that
generations have poured into you. Diseases go on from generation to
generation; you inherit the whole past with all its stupid ideas.
Otherwise, there would be no distinction, there is no comparison.</p><p><br></p><p>And once you are free from making comparisons and distinctions, you
are light, your whole existence is light. You lose all heaviness. You
become so light that you can open your wings and fly.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>YOU SEEM TO HAVE RETAINED, OR REGAINED, FROM YOUR CHILDHOOD, A
CAPACITY TO DREAM – SOMETHING WHICH PROBABLY ALMOST ALL OF US BEGIN LIFE
WITH, BUT WHICH, BY AND BY, BECOMES ERODED WITH CYNICISM AND THE FEAR OF
BEING THOUGHT NAIVE AND UNWORLDLY.</p><p><br></p><p>I LOVE WATCHING YOU WHEN YOU TALK OF A COMMUNE IN THE SKY, FLOATING
VEGETABLE GARDENS AROUND AN ISLAND-BASED CITY OF SANNYASINS, A MYSTERY
SCHOOL ASAIL THE HIGH SEAS: YOUR EYES OPEN WIDE, AND WHATEVER YOU SAY –
HOWEVER OFF-THE-WALL – ALWAYS SEEMS ABSOLUTELY POSSIBLE, AND I CAN NEVER
BRING MYSELF TO LAUGH BECAUSE I ADORE THIS ABILITY IN YOU.</p><p><br></p><p>I CAN SEE THAT THIS FACULTY ALONE IS ENOUGH TO DRIVE THE POLITICIANS
AND RELIGIOUS LEADERS ALL OVER THE WORLD, NUTS. INTERNALLY THEIR MOUTHS
MUST BE AGAPE AT YOUR SHEER AUDACITY, BECAUSE IT SEEMS YOU CAN ENVISAGE
ANYTHING AND GET AWAY WITH IT. LAWS OF LOGIC, GRAVITATION AND
RELATIVITY, ALL TAKE LEAVE OF THEIR SENSES IN YOUR HANDS.</p><p><br></p><p>AND EVEN IF ONE OR OTHER IDEA DOESN’T COME ABOUT, YOU ARE NOT
REMOTELY PERTURBED. IT IS AS IF THE VALUE LIES IN THE ABILITY TO DREAM –
NOT IN WHETHER THE DREAM IS REALIZED OR NOT.</p><p><br></p><p>IF THE MINDS OF THOSE AROUND YOU HAD THEIR SAY, WE WOULD FIND
OURSELVES CONFINED TO THE FEEBLE MUTTERINGS OF THE MEDIOCRE, THE SAFE,
THE CERTAIN. BUT IT IS AS IF YOU ARE SITTING IN THE FRONT SEAT OF A
ROLLER COASTER, AND WE, THE PASSENGERS, ARE BEHIND YOU. THE HEIGHTS ARE
SO DIZZYING, THE PACE, SO EXHILARATING, THE JOY, SO ADDICTIVE, THAT ONE
FEELS, “HANG THE EXPENSE – I’M GOING WHEREVER THIS JOKER TAKES ME!”</p><p><br></p><p>It is possible that to you it may seem that I have retained the small
child’s capacity to dream. But that is not the reality. I have certainly
retained the innocence of the child, but anything that I have said, or
done, or will do, is not a dream; and it is never “off-the-wall.” It
looks off-the-wall because you think in very utilitarian terms.</p><p>I am not a utilitarian. I am a poet, who does not compose poetry, who
composes living beings. My effort is not to materialize a dream – I
don’t have any dream – but to help you to see that your utilitarian life
is not all: that much more is possible, it is just that you have not
dared to cross the mundane line; that everything is possible, you just
have to gather courage.</p><p><br></p><p>And courage with innocence makes you capable of being a visionary,
not a dreamer – and there is a great difference between dream and
vision.</p><p><br></p><p>Dreams happen while you are asleep. They are part and parcel of our
spiritual sleep. A vision is the equivalent when you are fully awake.
Then you can see things which to others may look off-the-wall, but to
you they are just in the tomorrow. The day after tomorrow, just a
question of a little time, and they will be realities.</p><p><br></p><p>The politicians and the religious leaders are afraid because they
know that whatever I am saying is going to happen. All their efforts are
against the current. They can make a little delay, but they are moving
against the current.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, my vision of ocean cities is going to happen – whether
we make the first ocean city or somebody else makes it. But the earth is
becoming smaller, and the population is becoming bigger. Except for the
ocean there is no place where these people are going to live. And if the
whole world becomes full of people, houses, roads, then where are you
going to produce food?</p><p><br></p><p>I am a very realistic person, not a dreamer. When I say ocean cities
I speak of a simple reality: If all the people of the world move to
ocean cities, around the earth, and the whole earth is used for
production – for food, for vegetables, for everything else – we can
support a bigger population than is present today, without any
difficulty.</p><p><br></p><p>The ocean also has an infinite capacity for providing food, which has
not been explored. It grows a certain kind of vegetation, deep down,
thousands of feet down, that can be used as food. And it has been found
in experiments that it is full of the vital elements needed for food.
And this is simply wild growth. We can manage – just the way we have
managed on the earth – to grow food underneath the oceans.</p><p><br></p><p>Once man was a hunter, and he never thought that he would live in
cities, and that he would not be a hunter, but a farmer, a shopper, a
professor. For millions of years man remained a hunter, but a time came
when the population became too much, and it became difficult to survive
through hunting. Then some visionary must have given the idea: “We have
not used the fruits which are growing all around. To support a greater
population, use fruits.”</p><p><br></p><p>Then somebody else may have given the vision: “Why just use wild
fruits? We can cultivate food. Just watching nature, how these fruits
fall, how new trees grow out of the seeds... we can manage it better
than nature – we are nature’s conscious hand.” Cultivation came in.</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s how, slowly, slowly, man has developed things. But first
it was always a vision, and people laughed at it, because they were only
accustomed to the past, the old way. But the old way had come to an end
– something had to be done. So these visionaries who appeared to be
off-the-wall had to be listened to. Unwillingly, reluctantly, people
followed them and found that they were right: we</p><p>cultivated the whole earth. Now the earth is in a situation where it
cannot feed the whole population sufficiently. The ocean is available.
Life can be shifted to the oceans very easily.</p><p><br></p><p>Just last night I was asking Jay – because I am planning for it –
about the platforms which people use in wartime for their aircraft. Huge
platforms floating in the ocean are used for hundreds of planes to land
and take off. And underneath the platform, five or six thousand people
can live; they have cabins underneath the platform.</p><p><br></p><p>I loved the idea. Just one platform, and five or six thousand people,
with all the luxuries: with television, with telephone, with radio, and
your own airport on top of you – a meeting place, a mandir. And there is
no problem, it simply just has to be done. One person does it, and you
will see many others following.</p><p><br></p><p>And the tremendous silence of the ocean... and you are under no
government; just twelve miles off shore and you are really free. No
government is over you, and you can prove that six thousand people can
live without any government, without any police, without any courts,
without any legal experts – without all that paraphernalia – in immense
harmony.</p><p><br></p><p>And on the huge platform you can make lawns, you can make gardens;
you can have the beauty of the earth too. So you are not closed up in
the cabins; you can come out on the platform, and you have miles of
tennis courts, a golf course, swimming pools, lawns, beautiful trees.
All this can be managed on the platform. If it can keep hundreds of
planes, it can easily bear the weight of earth that we will bring to it
and the trees. And you can get your food from the nearby port. Small
boats can go and come for your food and your daily needs.</p><p><br></p><p>The idea can become a world-wide phenomenon. It is not a dream. Once
people see that it works, then around the earth there can be many
cities, vacating the earth for production. People can go in the day to
work on the earth, and at evening come home to the ocean. And it seems
to me very logical: man was born in the ocean, and perhaps it is time to
come back home.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t see it as a dream; it is just a reality which has to be
dared. And it is always that somebody has to be the pioneer; then others
will follow. Then for them there is no difficulty, they can see that
people are living beautifully. A whole university can float; there is no
need for them to destroy the earth with their campuses.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, if we exhaust the ocean too – which will take many thousands
of years – there is always a possibility of having floating cities in
the sky. All scientific facts are available on how a city can be floated
in the air. People will be coming to the earth for production and taking
their production back, but they will be living high in the sky.</p><p><br></p><p>And these should be adventures, great ecstasies for people, rather
than starving and dying like in Ethiopia – one thousand people dying and
starving every day, and nobody has any idea what to do.</p><p><br></p><p>When I started speaking in India the population was only four hundred
million. And I was from the very beginning for birth control; I was
condemned because religions are against it. I was for the pill; I was
stoned, efforts were made to kill me, because I was “destroying their
morality.”</p><p>If they had listened to me they would not be in such a trouble. Now
the population is nine hundred million – more than double. And by the
end of this century, India will have a population of one billion, eight
hundred million.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no possible way to feed this population – these people are
going to die. Fifty percent of the people will be dying, and when fifty
percent of people die, you can understand what will happen to the
remaining fifty percent: they will be living in a graveyard. Everywhere
will be corpses. Nobody will be there to burn them.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not my dream. I have all the facts from scientific experiments,
that cities can be floated in the sky: but for that, the time has not
come.</p><p><br></p><p>But for cities in the ocean the time has come, and it is particularly
a blessing that existence has given us the chance to be the pioneers –
because no country will accept me and my people, but the ocean belongs
to no country.</p><p><br></p><p>We are going to do it. And only when you see with your own eyes, only
when you are living on the ocean, then will you understand that it was
not a dream, that it was a vision.</p><p><br></p><p>Dreams cannot be fulfilled – dreams are unconscious. Visions are
conscious. Dreams happen to all sleeping people; visions happen only
when you are awakened. A vision is a reality that can be managed; you
just have to have courageous people with you. And I have the best, the
most intelligent, the most courageous people with me.</p><p><br></p><p>Never think anything I say is off-the-wall. It may appear to be to
you – that is just because you compare it with the old, trodden path. I
see it happening.</p><p><br></p><p>So just wait a little and you will be on the ocean.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part17>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

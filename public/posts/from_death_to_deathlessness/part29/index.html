COULD YOU TELL ME, WHERE IS HEAVEN AND WHERE IS HELL?\nThey will never locate heaven and hell anywhere. They are fictions, lies told to humanity to keep it enslaved, to console it in its suffering and torture, to prevent it from any revolution that could change the whole scene on the earth.\nBut in a certain sense, those words are significant. They are usable but only for your psychology, not for your geography.\nAnd you know perfectly well where they are.\nEverybody knows moments when he is in hell and moments when he is in heaven. These are states of the mind. Most of the time you are in hell. Once in a while, on the weekend, perhaps you have a little bit of heaven too.\nThat little bit of heaven is dangerous. It keeps you in hell, hoping for that little bit of heaven: “Tomorrow it will be coming. So it is only a question of somehow passing today, and just waiting patiently for tomorrow.”\nHell is the state of the mind in turmoil, in neurosis, in psychosis – split, in schizophrenia; a chaos, feeling no meaning, no purpose, and darkness all around. There are moments – you are perfectly acquainted with them: those moments are hell. It is not a reality outside you, it is what you create inside you.\nAnd in the same way, sometimes just tired of the hell – continuous suffering, torture, you cannot take it anymore – you relax for a moment. And a little breeze, a little coolness – you have a glimpse of heaven: in your love, in your friendship, in watching a sunrise, a sunset, or in just looking at the immensity of the universe, the stars. If you can see beauty, if you can be sensitive to the delicate music of existence, you will have a few moments here and there, scattered, which you can call heaven.\nBut this is not what the religions have been telling you. They say there is heaven above your heads, far away in the clouds, and a hell below you, far below.\nThere is a problem.In India, the hell used to be here in Oregon, deep down. If you go on digging\na hole from India, it is going to end up in Oregon – that’s how I ended up here. Just trying to dig a hole, suddenly I found myself in this desert. And for the Oregonians India is hell, because it is below them.\nThe earth is round! What is above your head? Heaven, if it existed, or hell, if it existed, would be in constant trouble, because your head is continuously moving with the earth. They would go crazy! Hell would be trying to remain below your feet; heaven would be trying to remain above your head. And the earth is revolving on its own center; not only that, it is also going around the sun.\nNo such heaven, no such hell exist.\nYuri Gagarin, the first man who went closest to the moon, who had the first close look and circled around the moon, the first question he was asked in Soviet Russia was, “Did you see God there?”\nHe said, “I did not see anybody.” So in Moscow they have a planetarium. In golden letters on the gate of the planetarium is written, “There is no God. Yuri Gagarin has looked and He has not been found.”\nYou can go to the farthest stars – one day man will go, but he will not find God. And you will not find anywhere heaven and hell; they have never been there.\nReligions have been playing upon your greed, your fear, your tremendous need for protection.\nMan is in a very precarious condition. All kinds of fear – and particularly the fear of death, sickness, disease, old age – and they go on increasing. It is not only man that is evolving; diseases go on evolving side by side. The fear of poverty, the fear of dying hungry in a street, the fear that perhaps nobody needs you – that you are just accidental, that if you are gone nobody will ever miss you.… There are layers and layers of fear in your psychology.\nThe priests became aware of your fear very early, in the very beginning times of humanity. They were the first psychoanalysts. And your fear can be exploited, you just have to be convinced that if\nyou do certain things you need not fear. If you do certain other things, then certainly you will fall into even deeper and darker spaces, into hellfire.\nThe earth is only a place where you have to prove whether you are worthy of enjoying heaven, or you deserve hell.\nThey exploited your greed. Who does not want to enjoy? Who does not want to live forever? Who does not want no sickness, no old age, to be always young, fresh? They created a heaven for your greed; it is the projection of your greed. And hell is the projection of your fear.\nNaturally, someone has to be in the seat of judgment; otherwise, who is going to decide where to send you? Without a judge there will be difficulties: the stronger people, although they have committed every kind of crime, may enter into heaven; simple people who have never committed any crime will have to go to hell. No, somebody has to be there with omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent powers; somebody who can see all, who can be present everywhere, who knows all, who can do everything. An absolutely powerful God is needed to decide.\nAnd it seems to be logical. If there is going to be something like a hell and a heaven, then somebody has to be decisive, and somebody has to force you to go to the right place. So they created God. Out of your fear and greed you accepted heaven and hell, and then you had to accept God.\nIn every culture, in every society, in every civilization, it is not the same God – obviously, because their psychologies differ. Their minds are conditioned differently, so their projections differ. There is a question here about the Mormons: they believe in a material God, and they also believe that God created the world out of preexisting material. Who created that material?\nWhen you create a fiction you create many problems. If nobody asks any questions it is okay, but if somebody starts asking questions, your fiction is going to be exposed. So there are religions who believe that before God nothing existed, God created everything. Now the question arises, from where? Just out of nothing?\nAnd if he could create out of nothing this whole universe, why did he wait so long? Christians say only four thousand and four years before Jesus Christ he created the world. So what was that dodo doing all the time for eternity? Just sitting in his rocking chair? But there is no mention of a rocking chair in any holy scripture. He must have been doing something.\nAny fiction will create problems. To avoid that, Mormons say God created the world from preexisting material so he is not producing the world out of nothing. But they forget that you can patch up your fiction from one side; the hole will appear on another side. From where did this preexisting matter come? Who created it? There must be another God, bigger. But it will lead you into an infinite regress. That bigger God will also create the world and your first God out of preexisting material. Who created that? Now you will be simply going into stupidity.\nThe Mormons are strange people – nice, intelligent, and still believing in such stupid things! The leader of the Mormons had seven or eight wives. If God is the creator of this whole world, at least the leader of the Mormons can create a little world out of eight wives – a big family. And that was their idea, that if all the Mormons marry many women, then sooner or later Mormons will be ruling over the world: just go on creating children.\nBut a strange idea, that God is a material thing.… This does not solve anything, it creates more problems. Other religions have the problem that God is a spiritual being and he creates the world – but the problem is: a spiritual being, from where does he get all this matter?\nHe is spiritual, just pure spirit. He cannot take out from himself any matter, but he cannot take it out from anywhere else, because that will mean the matter was already in existence. To avoid the difficulty Mormons believe God is a material thing, and now they fall into a bigger ditch: a material thing can create other material things?\nMatter cannot create matter. And matter cannot be worshipped either. Matter cannot be prayed to. What is the difference between the matter you walk upon and the matter that God is? To avoid one difficulty, they fell into another difficulty.\nThe other religions who think God is a spiritual being and the world is material have created a split in existence; it is not one, it is two. And that split is the cause of all human schizophrenia and suffering. Because they believed God is separate and the world is separate, naturally that separation goes down, back to your life.\nYour body is separate, your soul is separate; and you have to fight the body, destroy the body, torture the body, so that you can become a saint. The soul has to be freed from the body and bodily desires, bodily instincts.\nIt you look at the history of all the religions you will simply think, “Is this a history of religions, or mad people?”\nThere has been a Christian sect – it still exists – whose basic prayer is to beat themselves early in the morning as much as they can, till the blood starts coming out of their body – because the body is the enemy. It is the matter that is preventing them from becoming totally spiritual.\nIt is the body who asks for food, asks for sex, asks for a thousand and one things; and because of these desires they cannot reach desirelessness. This body has to be beaten and put right. Anybody who beats himself better than others becomes a saint, obviously – he is better in beating his body, he has more soul. He is becoming victorious over the body.\nIn Russia before the revolution, there was a Christian sect which used to cut off their genitals, because these are the troublemakers. But they could not see a single, simple point – that by cutting off the genitals you will not be able to get rid of your sexual mind. The real sex center exists in the mind; the genitals are only extensions of that center. Even without genitals, you will go on thinking about sex – perhaps more than ever.\nBut by cutting off their genitals, they became spiritual! Of course the women were not going to be left behind; they started cutting off their tits. These people were thought to be very great religious people – they were worshipped. They should be put into mental asylums. But the whole idea arises from the division of God and the world.\nThere is no God, so don’t be afraid of the judgment day. There is never going to be any judgment day. And anyway, in twenty-four hours, just think – even if your God is absolutely powerful – how\nmany millions of people who have lived for millennia will be gathered on one judgment day in one court? And half of them will be women, who don’t care about the court or anything; they will go yakketty-yak, yakketty-yak.An immeasurable crowd shouting for judgment!\nI don’t think it is manageable just in twenty-four hours to decide who is going where. Judgment day – the very idea is stupid. There will be so many files on everybody that it will take eternity for God to sort out the files. According to many religions you don’t have only one life, you have millions of lives – transmigration of life. And each life – even if you think moderately it is seventy years – will have loads of files about your actions, because even the smallest action has to be counted.\nAccording to Jainism, if you kill an ant it is recorded. Jaina monks use a mask on their nose, like the doctors do in the hospitals, because from the nose comes hot air and that hot air kills very small living beings in the air. With each breath you are killing almost one million living beings. Everything has to be counted. Even while sleeping you are committing sins.\nAnd Jainism goes to the very logical end. It says whether you commit a sin really or you only dream about it, it makes no difference. As far as your record is concerned, it will be recorded.\nThoughts are the origin of things. If you have an idea of murder, you may not get the opportunity to materialize it, but the very idea of murder in your dream shows your mind. You are a murderer. Now, making love in your dream with somebody else’s wife, which almost everybody is doing.You don’t\nallow it in the daytime, so the poor human mind has found a substitute. In the daytime the neighbor is sitting there with his gun, but in the night you have absolute freedom to make love to Cleopatra or anybody, even the queen of England. Even God cannot save her! In your dream, nobody can save her.\nIn Egypt there was one king who commanded his people, “Anybody coming into my dream will be immediately beheaded. I want silent sleep and I don’t want to be disturbed.” You cannot go even into his dream – and you are not going! You have nothing to do with him, it is his dream!\nBut many people were beheaded because once in a while somebody would show up. Most of them were women – neighbors’ women. Most of them were his own court people, because you see in your dream people with whom you are in some way acquainted. Some work is incomplete; the dream completes it.\nThe dream is a tremendous help to you. For example, your bladder is full in the night and you are asleep. Now if you become aware of the bladder, you will have to go to the bathroom and your sleep will be disturbed. The dream is very protective – you start dreaming that you are going to the bathroom. There is no need to go anywhere, there is no need to disturb the sleep. You simply dream you are going into the bathroom and you are relaxed. The dream saved you. The disturbance in the sleep is not allowed; the dream has created a buffer.\nEvery dream is your dream – nobody else is responsible for it. But there are idiots of all kinds. That king killed many people. And people were at a loss – what to do? Everybody was afraid, because if somehow he appears in the king’s dream, his life is finished. People stopped going any place where he could see their face, because perhaps he may remember the face in his dream and that is the end of their life.\nMan has been in many ways repressed.\nThe body has to be repressed... in fact that’s why you have dreams, because you are repressing so many desires which pop up in your dreams. If you were living your life totally and fully, without any repression, you wouldn’t have any dreams. One beautiful woman journalist was just asking me, “I have heard you don’t have dreams.”\nI said, “Certainly, I don’t have dreams. For example, I love you. You can be my girlfriend.”\nShe was shocked! She could not believe it! She enjoyed it too. She said, “But why are you saying it?”\nI said, “That’s why I don’t have any dreams. It came to me to say it, so I said it; it is finished. You need not trouble yourself to come into my dream. But if I don’t say it to you now, then you would have to come into my dream, and THEN I would say it to you.\n“It is simply finished. I have said it, you have heard, you have enjoyed. You have giggled. You will never have such an interview again in your whole life! I just do the thing that I want to do, without thinking of any consequences. That’s why I don’t have dreams. Do you want to question me more about it?”\nShe said, “No!” – because this man seems to be crazy. He may start making love to me, right now, here, before the television camera! If he can say it, he can do it too! It is better to change the subject.\nIf you are living your life consciously, alertly, not repressing, not being against your body, you will have a tremendous silence. In your night there will be no disturbance – no dreams, just silent sleep. And in your day you will have a very cool feeling surrounding you – no thoughts, no traffic of thoughts which keeps your head hot the whole day.\nSomebody was asking me, “In India you never used to have a cap. Why have you started wearing strange caps here?”\nI said to him the reason was that in India I had to keep my head open so thoughts could go out. Now I don’t have any thoughts! I have to prevent other people’s thoughts entering me, because they are all throwing their thoughts. I don’t see anybody having a cap here! It is dangerous among so many people throwing thoughts at you. I need a shelter, and the shelter has to be thick!\nThoughts are very cunning – just a small loophole and they will enter. With much difficulty I have been able to throw my thoughts; now I don’t want anybody’s burden, anybody’s rubbish thrown on my head.\nThe religions have not been beneficial to humanity. They have been committing very basic crimes, and this is one of the basic roles: to make man feel split, to make him feel his body is wrong and his soul is right.\nThe division is false – you are one.\nYour body, your consciousness, are different only in words, in dictionaries – but not in existence. Neither can your soul live without your body, nor can your body live without your soul. They are one, interwoven.\nAnd from there you can understand that there is no God as a creator separate from creation. Creativity itself is divine. Creativity itself is godliness. Once you remove God, you remove all split, all schizophrenia. And strangely enough, if you are not split you will not suffer hell. Fighting with yourself, you are destroying your life, hence you are miserable. Not fighting with your life but enjoying it, relishing it, you will be in heaven.\nFirst, send God into nothingness forever. He is not needed at all.\nHe has done enough harm. And it is only a word, it does not mean anything. And with God disappear heaven and hell; and you start living a natural, beautiful, authentic, sincere life. No religion is needed.\nMedicine is needed if you are sick. The doctors will die from starvation if nobody falls sick. The doctor’s profession is a very contradictory profession. He helps people to come out of sickness, knowing perfectly well he is destroying his own business. That’s why poor people get healthy quickly; they are not much of a business. Rich people... the doctor helps the process linger on.\nI have heard about a doctor who sent his son to medical college. The son came back, and the old man said, “Now that you are a doctor, I can retire. I am really tired” – because the doctor’s profession is such; in the middle of the night he may be called, in the cold night with snow falling, he will be called, and he has to go. Day and night, twenty-four hours he is on duty.\n“So I am really tired. You have come, now you take charge of the clinic.”\nThe boy was very happy. After three, four days the father asked him, “How are things going?”\nHe said, “Really great. The woman that you could not cure for thirty years, I have cured in three days.”\nThe father said, “My God, that was our basic income! That woman I have been keeping sick for thirty years. She has so much money, she can afford to remain sick for three hundred years. You idiot – you cured her! All your education has come from her sickness. Who do you think was sending you money to study in a medical college? It was that woman. If this is the way you are going to behave with my patients, perhaps you should retire; I will do my work. You will destroy the whole business.”\nThe boy can be forgiven – he was not yet aware of the profession. He had just acquired the medical knowledge, but he was not aware that there is a business side to it. He said, “I can understand. Now I know why you were sending me so much money.”\nHis father said, “It was all coming from that woman, and that woman could afford it, there was no problem – I just had to keep her sick.”\nThe religious priests depend on your fear, on your greed. They create hell and heaven; they create a god and they become the mediators. Anything you want to send to God, you cannot send directly. You don’t even know the address, or the phone number.\nThe Mormons believe that their president has a direct phone connection with God and whatever he says is God’s order.\nI came to know about this when this city was incorporated legally by a panel of three judges in Wasco County. Two judges were favorable. They were the majority; naturally the city was incorporated. Out of the two, one was a very nice old man – but he was a Mormon. And God immediately informed the president of the Mormons that this fellow has to be sent to Nigeria to spread the message of the Mormons.\nCertainly this message was from the White House. What does God have to do with this poor man in Wasco County, and how will he know?... In this big world he chooses immediately this Mormon! Strange choice, at a strange time.…\nBecause the politicians should not pressurize him – he is a sincere man – they sent him for one year to Nigeria. And of course they appointed another judge, who was appointed only because he is against me and my people. Now the majority is against us, so for two years the city remained legal – and suddenly after two years it became illegal.\nWe have not committed any illegal act. In fact, this is the only place where no illegal acts are being committed: no rape, no prostitution, no stealing, no murder, no suicide. And this is our fault, that we are not committing any illegalities. And in New York, every moment a crime is committed. But New York is a legal city; we are illegal.\nIn four years not a single illegal act – this is a record. No other city in the whole world can say that in four years not a single illegal act has happened there.\nWe don’t have a prison. The police, which belong to the Oregon state – we call it the peace force, because to us the word “police” seems to be dirty – they are getting tired, holding their guns the whole day. Nothing happens. And I am afraid if someday something happens, by that time they may have forgotten how to use their guns!\nThis man is educated, a gentleman in every way, but the religious stupidity is still there inside. He went to Nigeria.\nI sent him a message, “This is very strange, that you have been chosen especially, so suddenly. God has never shown any interest in you before, and there are so many Mormons. You are not a priest, you are not an orator either. What word are you going to spread there? Some priest should be sent, somebody who can speak should be sent. And why Nigeria? In this whole world, only Nigeria needs the word of Mormons to be spread?”\nPerhaps the White House was hoping – because Nigeria is the only country that has cannibalsIt\nwas an absolutely considered phenomenon to send him to Nigeria. Why not India? The whole world is there... but he is sent particularly to Nigeria where he will be facing.Poor man, he is not very\nstrong, old – those cannibals may finish him!\nThat must have been the idea, so that he does not come back again, because he has a respectability in the country; if he stands again for judge, he will be chosen. But somehow he has managed not to go near the cannibals.\nThey have their camp – nobody goes there. Once in a while a Christian priest is caught. When one Christian priest was caught and they tied him to a tree and started making a big fire, he said, “What are you doing?”\nThey said, “We are going to cook you.”\nHe was at a loss – what to do now? – he has come to spread the message. Still, he said, “Whatsoever time is left... while they prepare the fire, and bring big pots and oil, I should do my work. I should spread the word as much as I can in this small time.”\nHe asked the cannibals, “Have you ever tasted religion? Christianity?”\nThey said, “No, you are going to be our first taste. We will taste Christianity within one hour, don’t be worried!”\nThis poor judge somehow remained hanging around the cities where there are no cannibals. Cannibals are decreasing in number because they go on eating their own people. If they don’t find anybody else, what else to do? At the beginning of this century there were two thousand cannibals in Nigeria. Now there are only three hundred, and every day their number goes on decreasing.\nReligion has exploited people tremendously. Man has to free himself from all this exploitation. But that is possible only if you destroy the fiction of God, heaven and hell.\nLife is enough, more than enough. This universe is autonomous, it needs no creation. And this universe is totally one, it needs no division. And you have to live an undivided life; then you will know what paradise is.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO\nMY FATHER IS HERE TO VISIT, AND HE IS ENJOYING THE COMMUNE VERY MUCH. HOWEVER, HE FEELS THAT WE ARE TOTALLY DEPENDENT ON YOU, AND THAT YOU ARE DEPENDENT ON US. PLEASE COMMENT.\nYour father is really enjoying, it seems, because whatever he is saying is absolutely right. He just has to learn a little bit of my language.\nDependence, independence – both are fictions. Interdependence is the reality.\nAnd it is not only that you and I are interdependent, the whole existence is interdependent. If you don’t breathe for a few minutes you are gone. That means you were somehow connected with the\natmosphere around you, the air. If you don’t eat food, how long can you stay alive? If you don’t drink waterBut will your father say that he is dependent on water, he is dependent on air, oxygen, he\nis dependent on the sun, the sunrise?\nAnd the other way is also the same. It is difficult to prove because science has not yet been able to discover the proof but it is assumed that if the sun gives energy to us, it must be getting some energy from us. Otherwise, this business cannot go on forever. There must be some mutual transfer of energy.\nAnd we know it about trees – there is a continuous transfer of energy. They give you oxygen, you give them carbon dioxide. But will your father say he is dependent on trees and trees are dependent on him? The word “dependent” seems to be not right, because there is nothing which is independent – not for a single moment!\nExistence is an organic unity. So either call it interdependent.But if you would like me to give you\na word, I will call it organic unity, because that word “interdependence” somehow carries the word “dependence” and all the wrong associations with it. It is an organic unity.\nCertainly my commune is an organic unity. We are all one, so the question of dependence or independence does not arise at all. But if he is attached so much to those words, he can call it interdependence.\nBut he should remember that God is also dependent on the world, because without creation how will he be the creator? And the pope is dependent on Catholics – without the Catholics he will have to go back to Poland and be what actually he is!\nCan you give me a single example of anybody, anything, which is independent? It is not possible. We are all one life, different expressions of one life – just like sea waves. They all look different – some are higher, tidal waves; some are slower, smaller – but they are all one in the ocean. Their expressions, their personalities may be different, but their being is part of the whole.\nSo I support your father, he is perfectly right. But he should remember this truth does not apply only to this commune, this truth applies to the whole existence. And we are an existential commune.\nCertainly I cannot be here without you, because then I will think, “What the hell am I doing here?” And the same is true about you. Without me, the same question will arise in you.\nIn fact your father is also dependent. What the hell is he doing here? – dependent on his son! And because his son is in the commune, he has to come to the commune. And now he is enjoying the commune. If he is really enjoying, and if he is sincere... then be part of the commune, show it! Otherwise the commune will drive you nuts in your dreams.\nHis understanding is correct. And a man of such a correct understanding need not be an outsider here. So, help your father so he can be part of this beautiful phenomenon. Then he need not come to visit you, he can be here. And then he will find that not only his son is worth visiting, every sannyasin is worth visiting, because every sannyasin has some unique expression.\nWhy remain attached to small things – “my son”, “my father”? In this commune we have lost all small attachments. It may be difficult for you because your wife may be at home, and you may be afraid of her; she must be preparing hell for you. Don’t go!\nYou have come to the right place accidentally. But you are a man of understanding, so it is perfectly good to get lost in the orange people. Just become red, then even your wife will not be able to find you out.\nIt is better to be red than to be dead! I mean: d-a-d, dad!\nQuestion 3 BELOVED OSHO,\nA WELL-KNOWN STORY TOLD IN THE VATICAN SAYS THAT IF JESUS CAME BACK HE WOULD NOT BE CRUCIFIED AGAIN, BUT, AT THE MAXIMUM, BE PUT IN JAIL FOR HIS WHOLE LIFE. ACCORDING TO THE CARDINALS THIS IS PROOF THAT HUMANITY IS NO LONGER BARBARIAN. CAN THIS NEW FACT OPEN YOUR VISION ON HUMANITY AND ITS EVOLUTION?\nIn the first place, Jesus will be by this time so old that I don’t think it is possible for him to have another coming. Even the first coming will be difficult! Second time coming...? Impossible!\nThe story that is around there in the Vatican is in a way true. And that’s why he had promised his disciples, “I will be coming soon.” Now, you cannot stretch the word “soon” for two thousand years. Maybe one hour, two hours, one day, one week – but you cannot stretch it for two thousand years. What happened to his promise?\nAs far as I can see, although he was not very learned – he was illiterate – he was a man of a certain intelligence. Why should he come here?\nWhat did you do to him when he had come for the first time? You crucified him. That was the reward. It is enough. And now you are saying that if he comes this time – which is absolutely improbable – you will put him in jail for his whole life, to prove to him that humanity is no longer barbarian.\nBut being crucified finishes within a few hours. Keeping him his whole life in prison will prove you more barbarous. That is a long torture.\nMy suggestion is use an electric chair. That will really prove you are no longer barbarian, you are no longer primitive; you are scientific, technological, in every way evolved. Use an electric chair, comfortable – and within a second, not even knowing when he is gone, he will be gone.\nBut this will not prove that you are civilized. What method you use in killing him does not matter, that only proves methods of killing have improved; but the killer is the same.\nTwo thousand years ago, rabbis had killed him; now cardinals and popes will kill him – they are the same people, just the name is different. The rabbi and the cardinal are not different people – they are both priests!\nIn Dostoevsky’s masterpiece, BROTHERS KARAMAZOV, he has a beautiful story about Jesus coming back to the earth one day. Of course he had chosen Sunday, because on the other six days who will take care of him? Who will bother about him? Sunday... and he had chosen the right place – in the center of the town, before the church.\nPeople were coming out of the church after the sermon in the morning, and Jesus was standing there on a platform under a tree, waiting to see whether they recognize him or not. The crowd gathered. They said, “He looks like Jesus Christ. What a strange coincidence! Certainly he is a hippie, but he looks exactly like Jesus Christ.”\nListening to this, that they are thinking he is a hippie, Jesus said, “No, I am not a hippie. You are my people. You worship me in the church, you have my statue on the cross. You can’t recognize me?”\nThe people were in shock, looking at each other. What to do? They said, “As far as we are concerned, it does not matter whether you are a hippie or Jesus Christ. One thing you should do quickly – because the bishop is coming out; if he sees you, you will be in trouble – you escape as fast as you can!”\nJesus could not believe it! He said, “Wait! You are ignorant people, you don’t understand. You don’t recognize me, but my bishop – who has been teaching my teachings his whole life, kneeling down before my statue, praying to me every day – certainly he will recognize me.”\nThe bishop came, the crowd gave way. The bishop came near, looked from up to down, from down to up, and thought, “Looks exactly like Jesus Christ. A great actor!” And he said, “You get down from the platform! You get down immediately!”\nJesus said, “Don’t you recognize me?”\nHe said, “I have recognized you. You get down!” And he told a few people in the crowd, “Catch hold of him and take him inside the church, and lock him up there.”\nJesus said, “What are you doing? You must be joking! The people who crucified me of course were not my people. The rabbis of course were not my followers, but you are my follower”\nHe said, “You keep quiet! You simply do what you are being told to do.”\nAnd Jesus was locked in a small cabin, dark, dismal. He could not believe what was happening. “These people go on praying, ‘When are you coming?’ Now I have come – and this is the treatment you give to the founder of your religion?”\nThe whole day, hungry, thirsty, he waited. In the middle of the night somebody opened the door. The bishop entered, put a candle on the windowsill, fell at the feet of Jesus Christ and said, “I had recognized you, but I cannot recognize you in front of people. You will destroy our whole business. With great difficulty we have established the firm! It took us tremendous labor, fights, bloodshed, wars; finally, somehow we have managed the church. And you should be proud of us, that we are the biggest religion in the whole world. The largest number of people belong to your religion.\n“But I cannot accept you, recognize you, in front of the crowd for the simple reason that people of your type are always rebellious, dangerous. It is good when you are dead, but it is not good when you are alive! You will disrupt everything, you will destroy everything!\n“You were saying to the people, ‘Blessed are the poor.’ Now the Vatican is the richest place in the whole world. The pope rules over the greatest kingdom anybody can rule – immense power, immense riches. You will disturb things; we cannot allow it to happen.\n“You need not come, we are taking care of your business perfectly well. So you have to decide: either you get out and get lost – with due respect – or we will have to crucify you again tomorrow morning, because there is no other way to deal with you. When you are dead, we worship you; when you are alive, we crucify you.”\nI can understand. That’s what they have been doing with me. Many attempts have been made on my life; twice I have been poisoned. The last attempt was made before ten thousand sannyasins. Just like this morning, it was a beautiful morning, ten thousand sannyasins listening in utter silence.\nThe police got the message from some anonymous source that somebody is going to assault me, so the police officers reached in time. Twenty topmost police officers were present, ten thousand eyewitnesses, and the man threw the knife at me. The police caught him.\nWe did not get involved in it at all because it was a police case. The police themselves had caught him red-handed, making an effort to kill me. Still, the man was freed – respectfully. The court said, “There has been no such thing.”\nTen thousand eyewitnesses can be disbelieved because they are my people, but twenty topmost police officers? They had caught the man, we had nothing to do with it. They all told the court that this man had made an attempt on my life, but the court dismissed the case.\nThe magistrate must have felt guilty, seeing the whole thing. It was absolutely certain – his own police officers were saying it, and ten thousand witnesses were there. The knife was there that the man had thrown. On the knife you could have found his fingerprints – but nothing was done. No witness was called. The case was dismissed.\nThe magistrate must have felt guilty.\nThrough a common friend he informed me, “Please forgive me. There is so much political pressure and so much religious pressure on me, because that man belongs to a fanatic Hindu group and he has immense political power.\n“I am a poor man, and my promotion is due. If I do anything against him my promotion will be postponed forever. And they will send me to the ugliest, dirtiest place they can possibly find.”\nIn India you can find everything. There is a place, Cherapunji, where it rains five hundred inches in a year. You cannot get out of the house-it is always raining!\nFive hundred inches – that is the record in the whole world! Nowhere else does it rain so much. It simply rains the whole year! Nothing can be done. And whenever they want to punish somebody, they send him to Cherapunji.\nSo he asked my forgiveness. I told the intermediary, “Tell him, don’t feel guilty. I can understand – even without his saying – that the man who has tried to kill me has the support of the politicians, of the religious leaders. And don’t lose your promotion – I have not lost my life! Don’t be worried, you just get your promotion, get a better salary.\n“And as far as I am concerned, it does not matter whether I am killed or not. I have lived my live. I have enjoyed each moment of it, I have relished everything. I have never repressed any desire. What more can tomorrow bring me? There is no promotion for me.\n“I have experienced the ultimate; now, nothing more can happen. So life or death, both have become the same. And one day anyway I will have to die. This is far better.”\nNinety-nine percent of people die on their beds. That is the most dangerous place – just looked at mathematically, a simple calculation. Never sleep on the bed! Sleep on the ground. Ninety-nine percent of people have died on the bed – don’t take the risk. But wherever you sleep, you will die – death is certain from the very moment one is born.\nAnd in fact, I am a nonserious man. I would love the drama – somebody killing me.\nSo I will say to the pope and the cardinals, don’t be worried. Give Jesus a good, beautiful electric chair. Last time it was a little hard: he had to carry his own cross.\nAnd the cross must have been very heavy... because he was a carpenter’s son, his whole life he had been carrying big logs to his father’s shop; and he was a young man – thirty-three years old, in the prime of life. The cross must have been really heavy, because he fell three times on the ground before he reached the place where he was going to be crucified. The weight forced him to fall down on the ground three times. Now, don’t be so cruel to him.\nIn the first place, that experience is enough! He is not going to come. But in old age people become senile. Two thousand years old, he may have become senile and forgotten what has happened two thousand years before, and may come again. This time, give him a little more comfortable a death.\nYou will give him death, that much is certain, because either he can live or you can live – both cannot live together.\nYou may be reading the Bible, but everything you have been doing is against the Bible! And he will not tolerate it. He is not a very peaceful man; he is very angry, arrogant, easily excited.\nHe has done everything the last time he was here. He had thrown – when he was only thirteen years of age – all money changers out of the temple of Jerusalem; overturned their tables, their monies, and threw them out. And he was only thirteen!\nHe said to them, “I have come here to clean the house of my father.” The rabbis could not prevent him, they were standing there in shock: what was he doing? But whatever he was doing was according to the scripture.\nThe rabbis could not forgive this man. Whatever he was doing was according to scripture, and sooner or later people would start asking them questions. And he was going to destroy the whole\ntemple, because the whole temple depended on the money that came to it from poor people. He had to be finished.\nJesus was not a pacifist; otherwise he could not do such a thing. And he used to get angry very easily. He cursed a fig tree! Even the angriest man, even a madman like Adolf Hitler would not do such a stupid thing – cursing a fig tree because he and his disciples are hungry and the fig tree has not offered figs to them. And you have to know one thing more: it was not the season for figs. It was no fault of the poor tree.\nSo if Jesus comes, help him. Give him good champagne, which he loved. And let him sit on an electric chair so that he knows how much, technologically, man has evolved.\nAs far as man is concerned, there has been no evolution for thousands of years. We are stuck. And the people who are stopping the evolution of man are the priests and the politicians and the educationists.\nMy effort here is to free you from this triangle: the priest, the politician, the professor – these three P’s.\nFinish them before they finish you.\nFinish them before they finish the whole humanity.\nIf we can get rid of these three P’s, humanity can create a paradise without any difficulty.\nWe have already created in this desert an oasis. We are living joyously – no fights, no anger, no jealousy. And my people, of course, are giving me beautiful chairs – but not electric chairs!\nQuestion 4 BELOVED OSHO,\nWHAT IS A BLESSING?\nI am!

THEY ARE NOT YET ABLE TO LOCATE HEAVEN AND HELL. COULD YOU TELL ME,
WHERE IS HEAVEN AND WHERE IS HELL?</p><p><br></p><p>They will never locate heaven and hell anywhere. They are fictions,
lies told to humanity to keep it enslaved, to console it in its
suffering and torture, to prevent it from any revolution that could
change the whole scene on the earth.</p><p><br></p><p>But in a certain sense, those words are significant. They are usable
but only for your psychology, not for your geography.</p><p><br></p><p>And you know perfectly well where they are.</p><p><br></p><p>Everybody knows moments when he is in hell and moments when he is in
heaven. These are states of the mind. Most of the time you are in hell.
Once in a while, on the weekend, perhaps you have a little bit of heaven
too.</p><p><br></p><p>That little bit of heaven is dangerous. It keeps you in hell, hoping
for that little bit of heaven: “Tomorrow it will be coming. So it is
only a question of somehow passing today, and just waiting patiently for
tomorrow.”</p><p>Hell is the state of the mind in turmoil, in neurosis, in psychosis –
split, in schizophrenia; a chaos, feeling no meaning, no purpose, and
darkness all around. There are moments – you are perfectly acquainted
with them: those moments are hell. It is not a reality outside you, it
is what you create inside you.</p><p><br></p><p>And in the same way, sometimes just tired of the hell – continuous
suffering, torture, you cannot take it anymore – you relax for a moment.
And a little breeze, a little coolness – you have a glimpse of heaven:
in your love, in your friendship, in watching a sunrise, a sunset, or in
just looking at the immensity of the universe, the stars. If you can see
beauty, if you can be sensitive to the delicate music of existence, you
will have a few moments here and there, scattered, which you can call
heaven.</p><p><br></p><p>But this is not what the religions have been telling you. They say
there is heaven above your heads, far away in the clouds, and a hell
below you, far below.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a problem.<span class=s4></span>In India, the hell used to
be here in Oregon, deep down. If you go on digging</p><p>a hole from India, it is going to end up in Oregon – that’s how I
ended up here. Just trying to dig a hole, suddenly I found myself in
this desert. And for the Oregonians India is hell, because it is below
them.</p><p><br></p><p>The earth is round! What is above your head? Heaven, if it existed,
or hell, if it existed, would be in constant trouble, because your head
is continuously moving with the earth. They would go crazy! Hell would
be trying to remain below your feet; heaven would be trying to remain
above your head. And the earth is revolving on its own center; not only
that, it is also going around the sun.</p><p><br></p><p>No such heaven, no such hell exist.</p><p><br></p><p>Yuri Gagarin, the first man who went closest to the moon, who had the
first close look and circled around the moon, the first question he was
asked in Soviet Russia was, “Did you see God there?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I did not see anybody.” So in Moscow they have a
planetarium. In golden letters on the gate of the planetarium is
written, “There is no God. Yuri Gagarin has looked and He has not been
found.”</p><p><br></p><p>You can go to the farthest stars – one day man will go, but he will
not find God. And you will not find anywhere heaven and hell; they have
never been there.</p><p><br></p><p>Religions have been playing upon your greed, your fear, your
tremendous need for protection.</p><p><br></p><p>Man is in a very precarious condition. All kinds of fear – and
particularly the fear of death, sickness, disease, old age – and they go
on increasing. It is not only man that is evolving; diseases go on
evolving side by side. The fear of poverty, the fear of dying hungry in
a street, the fear that perhaps nobody needs you – that you are just
accidental, that if you are gone nobody will ever miss you.… There are
layers and layers of fear in your psychology.</p><p><br></p><p>The priests became aware of your fear very early, in the very
beginning times of humanity. They were the first psychoanalysts. And
your fear can be exploited, you just have to be convinced that if</p><p>you do certain things you need not fear. If you do certain other
things, then certainly you will fall into even deeper and darker spaces,
into hellfire.</p><p><br></p><p>The earth is only a place where you have to prove whether you are
worthy of enjoying heaven, or you deserve hell.</p><p><br></p><p>They exploited your greed. Who does not want to enjoy? Who does not
want to live forever? Who does not want no sickness, no old age, to be
always young, fresh? They created a heaven for your greed; it is the
projection of your greed. And hell is the projection of your fear.</p><p><br></p><p>Naturally, someone has to be in the seat of judgment; otherwise, who
is going to decide where to send you? Without a judge there will be
difficulties: the stronger people, although they have committed every
kind of crime, may enter into heaven; simple people who have never
committed any crime will have to go to hell. No, somebody has to be
there with omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent powers; somebody who can
see all, who can be present everywhere, who knows all, who can do
everything. An absolutely powerful God is needed to decide.</p><p><br></p><p>And it seems to be logical. If there is going to be something like a
hell and a heaven, then somebody has to be decisive, and somebody has to
force you to go to the right place. So they created God. Out of your
fear and greed you accepted heaven and hell, and then you had to accept
God.</p><p><br></p><p>In every culture, in every society, in every civilization, it is not
the same God – obviously, because their psychologies differ. Their minds
are conditioned differently, so their projections differ. There is a
question here about the Mormons: they believe in a material God, and
they also believe that God created the world out of preexisting
material. Who created that material?</p><p><br></p><p>When you create a fiction you create many problems. If nobody asks
any questions it is okay, but if somebody starts asking questions, your
fiction is going to be exposed. So there are religions who believe that
before God nothing existed, God created everything. Now the question
arises, from where? Just out of nothing?</p><p><br></p><p>And if he could create out of nothing this whole universe, why did he
wait so long? Christians say only four thousand and four years before
Jesus Christ he created the world. So what was that dodo doing all the
time for eternity? Just sitting in his rocking chair? But there is no
mention of a rocking chair in any holy scripture. He must have been
doing something.</p><p><br></p><p>Any fiction will create problems. To avoid that, Mormons say God
created the world from preexisting material so he is not producing the
world out of nothing. But they forget that you can patch up your fiction
from one side; the hole will appear on another side. From where did this
preexisting matter come? Who created it? There must be another God,
bigger. But it will lead you into an infinite regress. That bigger God
will also create the world and your first God out of preexisting
material. Who created that? Now you will be simply going into
stupidity.</p><p><br></p><p>The Mormons are strange people – nice, intelligent, and still
believing in such stupid things! The leader of the Mormons had seven or
eight wives. If God is the creator of this whole world, at least the
leader of the Mormons can create a little world out of eight wives – a
big family. And that was their idea, that if all the Mormons marry many
women, then sooner or later Mormons will be ruling over the world: just
go on creating children.</p><p>But a strange idea, that God is a material thing.… This does not
solve anything, it creates more problems. Other religions have the
problem that God is a spiritual being and he creates the world – but the
problem is: a spiritual being, from where does he get all this
matter?</p><p><br></p><p>He is spiritual, just pure spirit. He cannot take out from himself
any matter, but he cannot take it out from anywhere else, because that
will mean the matter was already in existence. To avoid the difficulty
Mormons believe God is a material thing, and now they fall into a bigger
ditch: a material thing can create other material things?</p><p><br></p><p>Matter cannot create matter. And matter cannot be worshipped either.
Matter cannot be prayed to. What is the difference between the matter
you walk upon and the matter that God is? To avoid one difficulty, they
fell into another difficulty.</p><p><br></p><p>The other religions who think God is a spiritual being and the world
is material have created a split in existence; it is not one, it is two.
And that split is the cause of all human schizophrenia and suffering.
Because they believed God is separate and the world is separate,
naturally that separation goes down, back to your life.</p><p><br></p><p>Your body is separate, your soul is separate; and you have to fight
the body, destroy the body, torture the body, so that you can become a
saint. The soul has to be freed from the body and bodily desires, bodily
instincts.</p><p><br></p><p>It you look at the history of all the religions you will simply
think, “Is this a history of religions, or mad people?”</p><p><br></p><p>There has been a Christian sect – it still exists – whose basic
prayer is to beat themselves early in the morning as much as they can,
till the blood starts coming out of their body – because the body is the
enemy. It is the matter that is preventing them from becoming totally
spiritual.</p><p><br></p><p>It is the body who asks for food, asks for sex, asks for a thousand
and one things; and because of these desires they cannot reach
desirelessness. This body has to be beaten and put right. Anybody who
beats himself better than others becomes a saint, obviously – he is
better in beating his body, he has more soul. He is becoming victorious
over the body.</p><p><br></p><p>In Russia before the revolution, there was a Christian sect which
used to cut off their genitals, because these are the troublemakers. But
they could not see a single, simple point – that by cutting off the
genitals you will not be able to get rid of your sexual mind. The real
sex center exists in the mind; the genitals are only extensions of that
center. Even without genitals, you will go on thinking about sex –
perhaps more than ever.</p><p><br></p><p>But by cutting off their genitals, they became spiritual! Of course
the women were not going to be left behind; they started cutting off
their tits. These people were thought to be very great religious people
– they were worshipped. They should be put into mental asylums. But the
whole idea arises from the division of God and the world.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no God, so don’t be afraid of the judgment day. There is
never going to be any judgment day. And anyway, in twenty-four hours,
just think – even if your God is absolutely powerful – how</p><p>many millions of people who have lived for millennia will be gathered
on one judgment day in one court? And half of them will be women, who
don’t care about the court or anything; they will go yakketty-yak,
yakketty-yak.<span class=s4></span>An immeasurable crowd shouting for
judgment!</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t think it is manageable just in twenty-four hours to decide
who is going where. Judgment day – the very idea is stupid. There will
be so many files on everybody that it will take eternity for God to sort
out the files. According to many religions you don’t have only one life,
you have millions of lives – transmigration of life. And each life –
even if you think moderately it is seventy years – will have loads of
files about your actions, because even the smallest action has to be
counted.</p><p><br></p><p>According to Jainism, if you kill an ant it is recorded. Jaina monks
use a mask on their nose, like the doctors do in the hospitals, because
from the nose comes hot air and that hot air kills very small living
beings in the air. With each breath you are killing almost one million
living beings. Everything has to be counted. Even while sleeping you are
committing sins.</p><p><br></p><p>And Jainism goes to the very logical end. It says whether you commit
a sin really or you only dream about it, it makes no difference. As far
as your record is concerned, it will be recorded.</p><p><br></p><p>Thoughts are the origin of things. If you have an idea of murder, you
may not get the opportunity to materialize it, but the very idea of
murder in your dream shows your mind. You are a murderer. Now, making
love in your dream with somebody else’s wife, which almost everybody is
doing.<span class=s4></span>You don’t</p><p>allow it in the daytime, so the poor human mind has found a
substitute. In the daytime the neighbor is sitting there with his gun,
but in the night you have absolute freedom to make love to Cleopatra or
anybody, even the queen of England. Even God cannot save her! In your
dream, nobody can save her.</p><p><br></p><p>In Egypt there was one king who commanded his people, “Anybody coming
into my dream will be immediately beheaded. I want silent sleep and I
don’t want to be disturbed.” You cannot go even into his dream – and you
are not going! You have nothing to do with him, it is his dream!</p><p><br></p><p>But many people were beheaded because once in a while somebody would
show up. Most of them were women – neighbors’ women. Most of them were
his own court people, because you see in your dream people with whom you
are in some way acquainted. Some work is incomplete; the dream completes
it.</p><p><br></p><p>The dream is a tremendous help to you. For example, your bladder is
full in the night and you are asleep. Now if you become aware of the
bladder, you will have to go to the bathroom and your sleep will be
disturbed. The dream is very protective – you start dreaming that you
are going to the bathroom. There is no need to go anywhere, there is no
need to disturb the sleep. You simply dream you are going into the
bathroom and you are relaxed. The dream saved you. The disturbance in
the sleep is not allowed; the dream has created a buffer.</p><p><br></p><p>Every dream is your dream – nobody else is responsible for it. But
there are idiots of all kinds. That king killed many people. And people
were at a loss – what to do? Everybody was afraid, because if somehow he
appears in the king’s dream, his life is finished. People stopped going
any place where he could see their face, because perhaps he may remember
the face in his dream and that is the end of their life.</p><p>Man has been in many ways repressed.</p><p><br></p><p>The body has to be repressed... in fact that’s why you have dreams,
because you are repressing so many desires which pop up in your dreams.
If you were living your life totally and fully, without any repression,
you wouldn’t have any dreams. One beautiful woman journalist was just
asking me, “I have heard you don’t have dreams.”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Certainly, I don’t have dreams. For example, I love you. You
can be my girlfriend.”</p><p><br></p><p>She was shocked! She could not believe it! She enjoyed it too. She
said, “But why are you saying it?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “That’s why I don’t have any dreams. It came to me to say it,
so I said it; it is finished. You need not trouble yourself to come into
my dream. But if I don’t say it to you now, then you would have to come
into my dream, and THEN I would say it to you.</p><p><br></p><p>“It is simply finished. I have said it, you have heard, you have
enjoyed. You have giggled. You will never have such an interview again
in your whole life! I just do the thing that I want to do, without
thinking of any consequences. That’s why I don’t have dreams. Do you
want to question me more about it?”</p><p><br></p><p>She said, “No!” – because this man seems to be crazy. He may start
making love to me, right now, here, before the television camera! If he
can say it, he can do it too! It is better to change the subject.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are living your life consciously, alertly, not repressing, not
being against your body, you will have a tremendous silence. In your
night there will be no disturbance – no dreams, just silent sleep. And
in your day you will have a very cool feeling surrounding you – no
thoughts, no traffic of thoughts which keeps your head hot the whole
day.</p><p><br></p><p>Somebody was asking me, “In India you never used to have a cap. Why
have you started wearing strange caps here?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said to him the reason was that in India I had to keep my head open
so thoughts could go out. Now I don’t have any thoughts! I have to
prevent other people’s thoughts entering me, because they are all
throwing their thoughts. I don’t see anybody having a cap here! It is
dangerous among so many people throwing thoughts at you. I need a
shelter, and the shelter has to be thick!</p><p><br></p><p>Thoughts are very cunning – just a small loophole and they will
enter. With much difficulty I have been able to throw my thoughts; now I
don’t want anybody’s burden, anybody’s rubbish thrown on my head.</p><p><br></p><p>The religions have not been beneficial to humanity. They have been
committing very basic crimes, and this is one of the basic roles: to
make man feel split, to make him feel his body is wrong and his soul is
right.</p><p><br></p><p>The division is false – you are one.</p><p>Your body, your consciousness, are different only in words, in
dictionaries – but not in existence. Neither can your soul live without
your body, nor can your body live without your soul. They are one,
interwoven.</p><p><br></p><p>And from there you can understand that there is no God as a creator
separate from creation. Creativity itself is divine. Creativity itself
is godliness. Once you remove God, you remove all split, all
schizophrenia. And strangely enough, if you are not split you will not
suffer hell. Fighting with yourself, you are destroying your life, hence
you are miserable. Not fighting with your life but enjoying it,
relishing it, you will be in heaven.</p><p><br></p><p>First, send God into nothingness forever. He is not needed at
all.</p><p>He has done enough harm. And it is only a word, it does not mean
anything. And with God disappear heaven and hell; and you start living a
natural, beautiful, authentic, sincere life. No religion is needed.</p><p><br></p><p>Medicine is needed if you are sick. The doctors will die from
starvation if nobody falls sick. The doctor’s profession is a very
contradictory profession. He helps people to come out of sickness,
knowing perfectly well he is destroying his own business. That’s why
poor people get healthy quickly; they are not much of a business. Rich
people... the doctor helps the process linger on.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard about a doctor who sent his son to medical college. The
son came back, and the old man said, “Now that you are a doctor, I can
retire. I am really tired” – because the doctor’s profession is such; in
the middle of the night he may be called, in the cold night with snow
falling, he will be called, and he has to go. Day and night, twenty-four
hours he is on duty.</p><p><br></p><p>“So I am really tired. You have come, now you take charge of the
clinic.”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy was very happy. After three, four days the father asked him,
“How are things going?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Really great. The woman that you could not cure for thirty
years, I have cured in three days.”</p><p><br></p><p>The father said, “My God, that was our basic income! That woman I
have been keeping sick for thirty years. She has so much money, she can
afford to remain sick for three hundred years. You idiot – you cured
her! All your education has come from her sickness. Who do you think was
sending you money to study in a medical college? It was that woman. If
this is the way you are going to behave with my patients, perhaps you
should retire; I will do my work. You will destroy the whole
business.”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy can be forgiven – he was not yet aware of the profession. He
had just acquired the medical knowledge, but he was not aware that there
is a business side to it. He said, “I can understand. Now I know why you
were sending me so much money.”</p><p><br></p><p>His father said, “It was all coming from that woman, and that woman
could afford it, there was no problem – I just had to keep her
sick.”</p><p>The religious priests depend on your fear, on your greed. They create
hell and heaven; they create a god and they become the mediators.
Anything you want to send to God, you cannot send directly. You don’t
even know the address, or the phone number.</p><p><br></p><p>The Mormons believe that their president has a direct phone
connection with God and whatever he says is God’s order.</p><p><br></p><p>I came to know about this when this city was incorporated legally by
a panel of three judges in Wasco County. Two judges were favorable. They
were the majority; naturally the city was incorporated. Out of the two,
one was a very nice old man – but he was a Mormon. And God immediately
informed the president of the Mormons that this fellow has to be sent to
Nigeria to spread the message of the Mormons.</p><p><br></p><p>Certainly this message was from the White House. What does God have
to do with this poor man in Wasco County, and how will he know?... In
this big world he chooses immediately this Mormon! Strange choice, at a
strange time.…</p><p><br></p><p>Because the politicians should not pressurize him – he is a sincere
man – they sent him for one year to Nigeria. And of course they
appointed another judge, who was appointed only because he is against me
and my people. Now the majority is against us, so for two years the city
remained legal – and suddenly after two years it became illegal.</p><p><br></p><p>We have not committed any illegal act. In fact, this is the only
place where no illegal acts are being committed: no rape, no
prostitution, no stealing, no murder, no suicide. And this is our fault,
that we are not committing any illegalities. And in New York, every
moment a crime is committed. But New York is a legal city; we are
illegal.</p><p><br></p><p>In four years not a single illegal act – this is a record. No other
city in the whole world can say that in four years not a single illegal
act has happened there.</p><p><br></p><p>We don’t have a prison. The police, which belong to the Oregon state
– we call it the peace force, because to us the word “police” seems to
be dirty – they are getting tired, holding their guns the whole day.
Nothing happens. And I am afraid if someday something happens, by that
time they may have forgotten how to use their guns!</p><p><br></p><p>This man is educated, a gentleman in every way, but the religious
stupidity is still there inside. He went to Nigeria.</p><p><br></p><p>I sent him a message, “This is very strange, that you have been
chosen especially, so suddenly. God has never shown any interest in you
before, and there are so many Mormons. You are not a priest, you are not
an orator either. What word are you going to spread there? Some priest
should be sent, somebody who can speak should be sent. And why Nigeria?
In this whole world, only Nigeria needs the word of Mormons to be
spread?”</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps the White House was hoping – because Nigeria is the only
country that has cannibals<span class=s4></span>It</p><p>was an absolutely considered phenomenon to send him to Nigeria. Why
not India? The whole world is there... but he is sent particularly to
Nigeria where he will be facing.<span class=s4></span>Poor man, he is
not very</p><p>strong, old – those cannibals may finish him!</p><p>That must have been the idea, so that he does not come back again,
because he has a respectability in the country; if he stands again for
judge, he will be chosen. But somehow he has managed not to go near the
cannibals.</p><p><br></p><p>They have their camp – nobody goes there. Once in a while a Christian
priest is caught. When one Christian priest was caught and they tied him
to a tree and started making a big fire, he said, “What are you
doing?”</p><p><br></p><p>They said, “We are going to cook you.”</p><p><br></p><p>He was at a loss – what to do now? – he has come to spread the
message. Still, he said, “Whatsoever time is left... while they prepare
the fire, and bring big pots and oil, I should do my work. I should
spread the word as much as I can in this small time.”</p><p><br></p><p>He asked the cannibals, “Have you ever tasted religion?
Christianity?”</p><p><br></p><p>They said, “No, you are going to be our first taste. We will taste
Christianity within one hour, don’t be worried!”</p><p><br></p><p>This poor judge somehow remained hanging around the cities where
there are no cannibals. Cannibals are decreasing in number because they
go on eating their own people. If they don’t find anybody else, what
else to do? At the beginning of this century there were two thousand
cannibals in Nigeria. Now there are only three hundred, and every day
their number goes on decreasing.</p><p><br></p><p>Religion has exploited people tremendously. Man has to free himself
from all this exploitation. But that is possible only if you destroy the
fiction of God, heaven and hell.</p><p><br></p><p>Life is enough, more than enough. This universe is autonomous, it
needs no creation. And this universe is totally one, it needs no
division. And you have to live an undivided life; then you will know
what paradise is.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO</p><p>MY FATHER IS HERE TO VISIT, AND HE IS ENJOYING THE COMMUNE VERY MUCH.
HOWEVER, HE FEELS THAT WE ARE TOTALLY DEPENDENT ON YOU, AND THAT YOU ARE
DEPENDENT ON US. PLEASE COMMENT.</p><p><br></p><p>Your father is really enjoying, it seems, because whatever he is
saying is absolutely right. He just has to learn a little bit of my
language.</p><p><br></p><p>Dependence, independence – both are fictions. Interdependence is the
reality.</p><p>And it is not only that you and I are interdependent, the whole
existence is interdependent. If you don’t breathe for a few minutes you
are gone. That means you were somehow connected with the</p><p>atmosphere around you, the air. If you don’t eat food, how long can
you stay alive? If you don’t drink water<span class=s4></span>But will
your father say that he is dependent on water, he is dependent on air,
oxygen, he</p><p>is dependent on the sun, the sunrise?</p><p><br></p><p>And the other way is also the same. It is difficult to prove because
science has not yet been able to discover the proof but it is assumed
that if the sun gives energy to us, it must be getting some energy from
us. Otherwise, this business cannot go on forever. There must be some
mutual transfer of energy.</p><p><br></p><p>And we know it about trees – there is a continuous transfer of
energy. They give you oxygen, you give them carbon dioxide. But will
your father say he is dependent on trees and trees are dependent on him?
The word “dependent” seems to be not right, because there is nothing
which is independent – not for a single moment!</p><p><br></p><p>Existence is an organic unity. So either call it interdependent.<span class=s4></span>But if you would like me to give you</p><p>a word, I will call it organic unity, because that word
“interdependence” somehow carries the word “dependence” and all the
wrong associations with it. It is an organic unity.</p><p><br></p><p>Certainly my commune is an organic unity. We are all one, so the
question of dependence or independence does not arise at all. But if he
is attached so much to those words, he can call it interdependence.</p><p><br></p><p>But he should remember that God is also dependent on the world,
because without creation how will he be the creator? And the pope is
dependent on Catholics – without the Catholics he will have to go back
to Poland and be what actually he is!</p><p><br></p><p>Can you give me a single example of anybody, anything, which is
independent? It is not possible. We are all one life, different
expressions of one life – just like sea waves. They all look different –
some are higher, tidal waves; some are slower, smaller – but they are
all one in the ocean. Their expressions, their personalities may be
different, but their being is part of the whole.</p><p><br></p><p>So I support your father, he is perfectly right. But he should
remember this truth does not apply only to this commune, this truth
applies to the whole existence. And we are an existential commune.</p><p><br></p><p>Certainly I cannot be here without you, because then I will think,
“What the hell am I doing here?” And the same is true about you. Without
me, the same question will arise in you.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact your father is also dependent. What the hell is he doing
here? – dependent on his son! And because his son is in the commune, he
has to come to the commune. And now he is enjoying the commune. If he is
really enjoying, and if he is sincere... then be part of the commune,
show it! Otherwise the commune will drive you nuts in your dreams.</p><p><br></p><p>His understanding is correct. And a man of such a correct
understanding need not be an outsider here. So, help your father so he
can be part of this beautiful phenomenon. Then he need not come to visit
you, he can be here. And then he will find that not only his son is
worth visiting, every sannyasin is worth visiting, because every
sannyasin has some unique expression.</p><p>Why remain attached to small things – “my son”, “my father”? In this
commune we have lost all small attachments. It may be difficult for you
because your wife may be at home, and you may be afraid of her; she must
be preparing hell for you. Don’t go!</p><p><br></p><p>You have come to the right place accidentally. But you are a man of
understanding, so it is perfectly good to get lost in the orange people.
Just become red, then even your wife will not be able to find you
out.</p><p><br></p><p>It is better to be red than to be dead! I mean: d-a-d, dad!</p><p>Question 3 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>A WELL-KNOWN STORY TOLD IN THE VATICAN SAYS THAT IF JESUS CAME BACK
HE WOULD NOT BE CRUCIFIED AGAIN, BUT, AT THE MAXIMUM, BE PUT IN JAIL FOR
HIS WHOLE LIFE. ACCORDING TO THE CARDINALS THIS IS PROOF THAT HUMANITY
IS NO LONGER BARBARIAN. CAN THIS NEW FACT OPEN YOUR VISION ON HUMANITY
AND ITS EVOLUTION?</p><p><br></p><p>In the first place, Jesus will be by this time so old that I don’t
think it is possible for him to have another coming. Even the first
coming will be difficult! Second time coming...? Impossible!</p><p><br></p><p>The story that is around there in the Vatican is in a way true. And
that’s why he had promised his disciples, “I will be coming soon.” Now,
you cannot stretch the word “soon” for two thousand years. Maybe one
hour, two hours, one day, one week – but you cannot stretch it for two
thousand years. What happened to his promise?</p><p><br></p><p>As far as I can see, although he was not very learned – he was
illiterate – he was a man of a certain intelligence. Why should he come
here?</p><p><br></p><p>What did you do to him when he had come for the first time? You
crucified him. That was the reward. It is enough. And now you are saying
that if he comes this time – which is absolutely improbable – you will
put him in jail for his whole life, to prove to him that humanity is no
longer barbarian.</p><p><br></p><p>But being crucified finishes within a few hours. Keeping him his
whole life in prison will prove you more barbarous. That is a long
torture.</p><p><br></p><p>My suggestion is use an electric chair. That will really prove you
are no longer barbarian, you are no longer primitive; you are
scientific, technological, in every way evolved. Use an electric chair,
comfortable – and within a second, not even knowing when he is gone, he
will be gone.</p><p><br></p><p>But this will not prove that you are civilized. What method you use
in killing him does not matter, that only proves methods of killing have
improved; but the killer is the same.</p><p><br></p><p>Two thousand years ago, rabbis had killed him; now cardinals and
popes will kill him – they are the same people, just the name is
different. The rabbi and the cardinal are not different people – they
are both priests!</p><p>In Dostoevsky’s masterpiece, BROTHERS KARAMAZOV, he has a beautiful
story about Jesus coming back to the earth one day. Of course he had
chosen Sunday, because on the other six days who will take care of him?
Who will bother about him? Sunday... and he had chosen the right place –
in the center of the town, before the church.</p><p><br></p><p>People were coming out of the church after the sermon in the morning,
and Jesus was standing there on a platform under a tree, waiting to see
whether they recognize him or not. The crowd gathered. They said, “He
looks like Jesus Christ. What a strange coincidence! Certainly he is a
hippie, but he looks exactly like Jesus Christ.”</p><p><br></p><p>Listening to this, that they are thinking he is a hippie, Jesus said,
“No, I am not a hippie. You are my people. You worship me in the church,
you have my statue on the cross. You can’t recognize me?”</p><p><br></p><p>The people were in shock, looking at each other. What to do? They
said, “As far as we are concerned, it does not matter whether you are a
hippie or Jesus Christ. One thing you should do quickly – because the
bishop is coming out; if he sees you, you will be in trouble – you
escape as fast as you can!”</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus could not believe it! He said, “Wait! You are ignorant people,
you don’t understand. You don’t recognize me, but my bishop – who has
been teaching my teachings his whole life, kneeling down before my
statue, praying to me every day – certainly he will recognize me.”</p><p><br></p><p>The bishop came, the crowd gave way. The bishop came near, looked
from up to down, from down to up, and thought, “Looks exactly like Jesus
Christ. A great actor!” And he said, “You get down from the platform!
You get down immediately!”</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus said, “Don’t you recognize me?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I have recognized you. You get down!” And he told a few
people in the crowd, “Catch hold of him and take him inside the church,
and lock him up there.”</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus said, “What are you doing? You must be joking! The people who
crucified me of course were not my people. The rabbis of course were not
my followers, but you are my follower<span class=s4></span>”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “You keep quiet! You simply do what you are being told to
do.”</p><p><br></p><p>And Jesus was locked in a small cabin, dark, dismal. He could not
believe what was happening. “These people go on praying, ‘When are you
coming?’ Now I have come – and this is the treatment you give to the
founder of your religion?”</p><p><br></p><p>The whole day, hungry, thirsty, he waited. In the middle of the night
somebody opened the door. The bishop entered, put a candle on the
windowsill, fell at the feet of Jesus Christ and said, “I had recognized
you, but I cannot recognize you in front of people. You will destroy our
whole business. With great difficulty we have established the firm! It
took us tremendous labor, fights, bloodshed, wars; finally, somehow we
have managed the church. And you should be proud of us, that we are the
biggest religion in the whole world. The largest number of people belong
to your religion.</p><p>“But I cannot accept you, recognize you, in front of the crowd for
the simple reason that people of your type are always rebellious,
dangerous. It is good when you are dead, but it is not good when you are
alive! You will disrupt everything, you will destroy everything!</p><p><br></p><p>“You were saying to the people, ‘Blessed are the poor.’ Now the
Vatican is the richest place in the whole world. The pope rules over the
greatest kingdom anybody can rule – immense power, immense riches. You
will disturb things; we cannot allow it to happen.</p><p><br></p><p>“You need not come, we are taking care of your business perfectly
well. So you have to decide: either you get out and get lost – with due
respect – or we will have to crucify you again tomorrow morning, because
there is no other way to deal with you. When you are dead, we worship
you; when you are alive, we crucify you.”</p><p><br></p><p>I can understand. That’s what they have been doing with me. Many
attempts have been made on my life; twice I have been poisoned. The last
attempt was made before ten thousand sannyasins. Just like this morning,
it was a beautiful morning, ten thousand sannyasins listening in utter
silence.</p><p><br></p><p>The police got the message from some anonymous source that somebody
is going to assault me, so the police officers reached in time. Twenty
topmost police officers were present, ten thousand eyewitnesses, and the
man threw the knife at me. The police caught him.</p><p><br></p><p>We did not get involved in it at all because it was a police case.
The police themselves had caught him red-handed, making an effort to
kill me. Still, the man was freed – respectfully. The court said, “There
has been no such thing.<span class=s4></span>”</p><p><br></p><p>Ten thousand eyewitnesses can be disbelieved because they are my
people, but twenty topmost police officers? They had caught the man, we
had nothing to do with it. They all told the court that this man had
made an attempt on my life, but the court dismissed the case.</p><p><br></p><p>The magistrate must have felt guilty, seeing the whole thing. It was
absolutely certain – his own police officers were saying it, and ten
thousand witnesses were there. The knife was there that the man had
thrown. On the knife you could have found his fingerprints – but nothing
was done. No witness was called. The case was dismissed.</p><p>The magistrate must have felt guilty.</p><p><br></p><p>Through a common friend he informed me, “Please forgive me. There is
so much political pressure and so much religious pressure on me, because
that man belongs to a fanatic Hindu group and he has immense political
power.</p><p><br></p><p>“I am a poor man, and my promotion is due. If I do anything against
him my promotion will be postponed forever. And they will send me to the
ugliest, dirtiest place they can possibly find.”</p><p><br></p><p>In India you can find everything. There is a place, Cherapunji, where
it rains five hundred inches in a year. You cannot get out of the
house-it is always raining!</p><p><br></p><p>Five hundred inches – that is the record in the whole world! Nowhere
else does it rain so much. It simply rains the whole year! Nothing can
be done. And whenever they want to punish somebody, they send him to
Cherapunji.</p><p>So he asked my forgiveness. I told the intermediary, “Tell him, don’t
feel guilty. I can understand – even without his saying – that the man
who has tried to kill me has the support of the politicians, of the
religious leaders. And don’t lose your promotion – I have not lost my
life! Don’t be worried, you just get your promotion, get a better
salary.</p><p><br></p><p>“And as far as I am concerned, it does not matter whether I am killed
or not. I have lived my live. I have enjoyed each moment of it, I have
relished everything. I have never repressed any desire. What more can
tomorrow bring me? There is no promotion for me.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have experienced the ultimate; now, nothing more can happen. So
life or death, both have become the same. And one day anyway I will have
to die. This is far better.”</p><p><br></p><p>Ninety-nine percent of people die on their beds. That is the most
dangerous place – just looked at mathematically, a simple calculation.
Never sleep on the bed! Sleep on the ground. Ninety-nine percent of
people have died on the bed – don’t take the risk. But wherever you
sleep, you will die – death is certain from the very moment one is
born.</p><p><br></p><p>And in fact, I am a nonserious man. I would love the drama – somebody
killing me.</p><p><br></p><p>So I will say to the pope and the cardinals, don’t be worried. Give
Jesus a good, beautiful electric chair. Last time it was a little hard:
he had to carry his own cross.</p><p><br></p><p>And the cross must have been very heavy... because he was a
carpenter’s son, his whole life he had been carrying big logs to his
father’s shop; and he was a young man – thirty-three years old, in the
prime of life. The cross must have been really heavy, because he fell
three times on the ground before he reached the place where he was going
to be crucified. The weight forced him to fall down on the ground three
times. Now, don’t be so cruel to him.</p><p><br></p><p>In the first place, that experience is enough! He is not going to
come. But in old age people become senile. Two thousand years old, he
may have become senile and forgotten what has happened two thousand
years before, and may come again. This time, give him a little more
comfortable a death.</p><p><br></p><p>You will give him death, that much is certain, because either he can
live or you can live – both cannot live together.</p><p><br></p><p>You may be reading the Bible, but everything you have been doing is
against the Bible! And he will not tolerate it. He is not a very
peaceful man; he is very angry, arrogant, easily excited.</p><p><br></p><p>He has done everything the last time he was here. He had thrown –
when he was only thirteen years of age – all money changers out of the
temple of Jerusalem; overturned their tables, their monies, and threw
them out. And he was only thirteen!</p><p><br></p><p>He said to them, “I have come here to clean the house of my father.”
The rabbis could not prevent him, they were standing there in shock:
what was he doing? But whatever he was doing was according to the
scripture.</p><p><br></p><p>The rabbis could not forgive this man. Whatever he was doing was
according to scripture, and sooner or later people would start asking
them questions. And he was going to destroy the whole</p><p>temple, because the whole temple depended on the money that came to
it from poor people. He had to be finished.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus was not a pacifist; otherwise he could not do such a thing. And
he used to get angry very easily. He cursed a fig tree! Even the
angriest man, even a madman like Adolf Hitler would not do such a stupid
thing – cursing a fig tree because he and his disciples are hungry and
the fig tree has not offered figs to them. And you have to know one
thing more: it was not the season for figs. It was no fault of the poor
tree.</p><p><br></p><p>So if Jesus comes, help him. Give him good champagne, which he loved.
And let him sit on an electric chair so that he knows how much,
technologically, man has evolved.</p><p><br></p><p>As far as man is concerned, there has been no evolution for thousands
of years. We are stuck. And the people who are stopping the evolution of
man are the priests and the politicians and the educationists.</p><p><br></p><p>My effort here is to free you from this triangle: the priest, the
politician, the professor – these three P’s.</p><p><br></p><p>Finish them before they finish you.</p><p><br></p><p>Finish them before they finish the whole humanity.</p><p><br></p><p>If we can get rid of these three P’s, humanity can create a paradise
without any difficulty.</p><p><br></p><p>We have already created in this desert an oasis. We are living
joyously – no fights, no anger, no jealousy. And my people, of course,
are giving me beautiful chairs – but not electric chairs!</p><p><br></p><p>Question 4 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>WHAT IS A BLESSING?</p><p><br></p><p>I am! Okay?</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part28>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

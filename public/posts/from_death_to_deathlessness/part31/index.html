AT THE PRESENT TIME – ESPECIALLY IN THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES – REPORTS ARE SURFACING EVERY DAY OF UNBELIEVABLE ATROCITIES COMMITTED BY MAN AGAINST MAN. FROM WHERE DOES THIS DESIRE TO TORTURE OTHERS ARISE? DO SUCH PERVERTED ACTS STEM FROM A DEEP SENSE OF FRUSTRATION AND THE NEED TO TAKE REVENGE AGAINST SOCIETY? PLEASE COMMENT.\nMan’s whole history is a history of torture, murder, rape. But in the past it was not possible to know about the whole world, what was happening; people knew only about local things. Now the earth has become so small that within minutes, wherever anything happens, it spreads all over the world. The media has made people aware of man’s reality. In the past it remained hidden. Now it has surfaced.\nThere are reasons why man is so inhuman. The reasons are many, but the few most important ones should be understood.\nOne, all the religions of the world have been teaching unnatural things to humanity – celibacy, renouncing the pleasures and comforts of life, living in poverty. For centuries they have been telling these things to people, and they have kept the people uneducated, illiterate.\nBut an explosion in the contemporary world of education has created a tremendous problem. Now people know that what has been told to them was not right – it was not according to nature, it was against nature. They are full of rage against the whole past.\nThe religions have corrupted their minds, have led them to perverted sexual practices. The religions have put one man against another. There are three hundred religions on the earth, and each claims that it is the only ultimate truth, all others are false.\nNow, anybody who has a little intelligence can see the point that there can be only one kind of religiousness, unnamed – just like science. You don’t call it Jewish science, Mohammedan science, Hindu science, Christian science. Just to call it science is enough; its rules are universal.\nReligion is the science of the inner world. Its rules also are universal.\nBut these three hundred religions have been teaching you just the opposite. They have been teaching you rituals which don’t lead you inside. They have been teaching you about a God who lives above the clouds; nobody has seen him. They have been teaching you commandments written three thousand years ago, written five thousand years ago – written, and you have to live according to them.\nThey have encaged you.\nIn every possible way you are chained – not only your body, but your spirit.\nHence, everywhere atrocities are surfacing. They have been surfacing down the ages, but the media to inform you about the reality that is happening all around the earth was missing. Education was missing. Now you are educated, whether you are a Jew or a Christian or a Hindu or a Buddhist, in the same way, in the same science, the same laws.\nIn every way science has made the whole humanity one. But religions go on carrying the hangover of the past, dividing man against man.\nThe violence that they have repressed for centuries has come to a climax. The people want to take revenge, because they have been mistreated, they have been deceived by the people they have trusted – by their prophets, their messiahs, their incarnations of God.\nThese people have been the greatest criminals. They divided humanity.\nThey divided you, split you into body and soul: you have to torture your body if you want to know the soul. So for thousands of years people have been torturing their bodies; that was the only way to become saintly. But now it is difficult to convince people that by torturing their bodies they will become holy. There seems to be no sense in it.\nMan has been divided into man and woman. Half of humanity consists of women, and they have lived a life of slavery, torture, indignity. They are rebelling.\nMan is rebelling against the past unconsciously. He is enraged by the whole human history. And he is so full of anger, violence, that any small thing brings it up, and it starts spreading like a wildfire.\nSecondly, man is tremendously frustrated because the leaders of mankind in the past have been giving him hope, hope of a paradise beyond death. Not a single person has returned after death and given his eyewitness evidence that there is a paradise, that there is a God, that your acts will be judged – you will be thrown into eternal hell or into the eternal blissfulness of paradise.\nNobody has ever returned. Nobody knows anything about life after death, and people have been sacrificing their present for an unknown future. Now they cannot do it anymore, they have done enough. They want paradise here and now. The leaders cannot supply the goods that they have been promising them. Beyond death, of course, they are ready to give you anything you want, but people want it now. That creates a great hopelessness, frustration, meaninglessness.\nPeople have not been taught the art of living beautifully, the art of being graceful, the art of being silent, meditative. Instead of teaching these authentic realities which can be done right now, their minds were taken away from the present to some unknown future – nobody knows whether it exists or not.\nNow, because people become literate, educated, they can see the great deceit. They have been cheated, and a great anger is there. Not only their life but millions of lives for centuries have been exploited by these cheaters.\nReligious priests have parasites sucking your blood. Now it is absolutely impossible for those religions to exist anymore. They should disappear gracefully, and allow a new way of life which is centered in the present, so that something can be done to the human psychology.\nMan has immense capacity to love.\nIf his love is given freedom, he will never commit anything that goes against love. Man has immense capacity to be compassionate.\nHe will not commit violence on any slight excuse. But he has to be awakened!\nThe religions have been giving him opium, and for thousands of years they have made him completely unconscious. It was good for them – they could exploit people easily.\nAll the vested interests were together: the politician, the priest, the pedagogue, all were together, because if man becomes awake then there is no need for politicians; he will see them as criminals. There is no need for priests; he will see them as the greatest cheats that have existed ever.\nThese priests have been telling people, “Blessed are the poor.” They themselves are not poor – pope the Polack is the richest man in the world. But nobody asks him the question, “Blessed are the poor – so what the hell are you doing in the Vatican? Go to Calcutta and start begging on the streets! –\nbecause if you remain the pope you will be the last to enter into paradise, and perhaps you will be thrown into hell.”\nThe pope goes on quoting Jesus Christ, and for centuries you have listened to, “Blessed are the poor.” The rich are cursed, because even a camel can pass through the eye of a needle, but the rich man cannot pass through the gates of paradise.\nAnd why are people poor? Every religion has given some explanation, has to give one. The Christians are poor because God is very loving to you. You are the blessed; he is preparing you for paradise. This is a test of your trust.\nIn India, Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism have been telling people, “You are poor because in your past life you committed some grave sins, some evil acts, and this is the punishment. Don’t do anything wrong in this life. Patiently suffer, gracefully accept the punishment – in the next life you will be rich.”\nNow this is distracting people from the reality. The reality is that they are being exploited in this life, right now.\nAnd the explanation is really far-fetched. In a past life you put your hand on a candle flame – you did not burn yourself then, but you have a burned hand! Nobody knows about the past life; and cause and effect cannot be so distant. You do something, you hit your head against the wall and you will suffer now. You put your hand in the fire and you will be burned now. There is no explanation why the result comes in the next life.\nSo either past lives have been taken as an explanation to the poor, to give them consolation that they deserve this poverty; or God has to be brought in, that he is testing your trust. Strangely enough... why is he not testing the rich people? Why is he against the rich people?\nAnd in Christianity, Mohammedanism, Judaism, there is only one life. So the rich person is born without any past life in which he would have committed some evil acts; that’s why God has not given him the test of trust and has taken away the opportunity of entering into paradise.\nA strange God! He makes people rich, comfortable, luxurious, because he is against them. But why is he against them? They have not done anything. This is their only life! Why has he chosen a few people to be rich, and many people to be poor?\nAll these explanations are bogus; and the contemporary mind is becoming clear about all these explanations, that they were strategies to keep the poor, poor, and to make the rich, richer.\nIn a country like India no revolution has ever happened, although the whole country is poor. In the hands of only a few families all the riches of the country have gathered. The whole country is starving, hungry, but they have accepted it patiently up to now.\nThere is a limit to everything. Now they are burning. They know they have been cheated, badly cheated. So there are going to be riots, there are going to be killings. And the responsibility goes to your prophets, your messiahs, your messengers of God – and finally, to God. If God exists anywhere, he is the greatest criminal. To create a world with so much hatred, anger, rage, violence.…\nThis is something strange. You make something wrong, and if it behaves wrongly then you punish it. Who has made you a sexual being? If God wanted celibacy, there was no problem for him. If he can create the whole world within six days, can’t he manage that man is born without sex, without greed, without jealousy, without anger, without hate? No, He has made a man full of all these things. And anger, hate, jealousy you need not learn; they are instinctive, they are God-given.\nMeditation you will have to learn – God has not given that to you. This God must be nuts! He has not given you the most precious thing: the art of knowing yourself. In fact, he was against all knowledge. He prevented Adam and Eve from eating from the tree of knowledge and from eating from the tree of eternal life.\nCan you think of this God as divine, who is preventing his children from wisdom and from the taste of eternal life? These are the two things that he should have insisted on: “First taste these two trees, and then the whole Garden of Eden is yours.”\nBut this God is the invention of the vested interests. The priests never wanted people to be educated, they never wanted the people to become intelligent, because there was danger. In their education, in their intelligence the people will start asking questions. And the priests don’t have any authentic answers, because all that the priests have created in the name of religion is fiction – and ugly fiction.\nNow the new generation is becoming aware everywhere that this God has to be dropped. Nietzsche said, “God is dead and man is free.” But the younger generation wants God not to be dead, they want to murder him. Just an easy death does not appeal; they want to murder him. And you will see your temples, your synagogues, your churches on fire soon! Your Bible, your holy Koran, your holy Gita – you will soon see in bonfires.\nMan has come of age, he is mature.\nHe can see how he has been deceived, and he has to destroy everything that has deceived him.\nBut the priests are very cunning; cunningness is their profession. They are professional exploiters, parasites, because for centuries they have done nothing else; they have become very skillful. So rather than allowing you to burn the Bible, to burn the Vatican, to kill God, they go on diverting you – Christians against Mohammedans, Mohammedans against Hindus, Hindus against Buddhists. And you are so full of rage that you have lost all reason, you simply want to destroy. And the priests are using this situation. If they don’t use it, you will destroy them!\nSo all over the world religions are fighting, nations are fighting, races are fighting. Who is creating all this? The people who have dominated you for centuries know perfectly well that your anger, your hatred has to be diverted; otherwise, they will be the targets.\nThey are all against me for a single reason – that I want your rage to go in the right direction. I don’t want to divert it. I want you to meditate and in silence see what has been done to man in the whole history. And out of your silence and peace, if you feel that something has to be destroyed because it has been hindering the growth of man, his consciousness, that destruction will be totally different.\nIt will not be of people. If will be of your holy books, it will be of your holy places, it will be of your synagogues, churches, mosques. It will not be directed to other human beings who belong to other\ngroups. It will not be between Americans and Soviet people – they both have been exploited by different kinds of priests.\nCommunism is the latest religion.\nIt has its own priests, it has its own holy DAS KAPITAL. It has its own holy place of pilgrimage – the Kremlin. It has its own trinity – Marx, Engels, Lenin. It has replaced the old religion.\nThere is no need for Americans to destroy Russians, or Russians to destroy Americans. If we are intelligent, all the politicians – Russians and Americans – should be imprisoned immediately. And the masses can do it! They just have to be awakened as to who is the real enemy.\nBoundaries of the countries should be dissolved. They don’t exist on the earth, only on the map. The whole humanity is one, and the whole humanity should pool all its energies. And we can make this earth a paradise.…\nYou can see this small commune – only five thousand people are living here, and within four years we have changed the desert into an oasis. We are growing our food, our vegetables, our milk products; we are self-sufficient. And in four years not a single crime has happened. Nobody has been beaten, nobody has been raped, nobody has committed suicide, nobody has been murdered.\nFive thousand people living together have pooled their energies. One kitchen is enough for five thousand people. Naturally, it saves immensely in money, in human power. Otherwise, there would have been at least one thousand kitchens, one thousand women would have been doing just one thing. Now only a few women manage; and far better food is provided to the commune than you can get from a nagging wife.\nWe are living comfortably, we are enjoying everything that is beautiful. We are rejoicing, dancing, singing – you will not see long faces here. And nobody is bothered about God – strange! Nobody is bothered about heaven and hell. Those are stupid questions. Why waste your intelligence on stupid questions?\nPeople are concerned with how to be more creative, how to produce more, how to make the commune absolutely self-sufficient so that even if the whole world suddenly disappears leaving this commune alone, there will be no problem.\nYou say, “Everywhere atrocities are surfacing” – please, exclude my commune! There are no atrocities here.\nPeople are so loving, so compassionate – they just need to be made aware of their great potential. People are intelligent – they just have to be given a chance to sharpen their intelligence.\nThe whole world has been fed with the idea of belief. All the religions want you to believe, have faith. That destroys your intelligence. That’s their way of destroying your intelligence, keeping you retarded.\nIn my commune, belief is non-existent.\nWe trust in doubt, because doubt sharpens intelligence, it creates questions for which you have to find answers. This is the way your intelligence becomes sharp. We teach doubt, we teach skepticism, we teach agnosticism. Agnosticism means, be sincere about one thing – what you know and what you don’t know. And if you don’t know something, accept it, that “I don’t know.”\nThis will be punished in the outside world. The outside world respects hypocrites. Whether you know or not, you have to pretend that you know.\nThe American scouts have just rejected and expelled one brilliant young man – just fourteen years of age. He was their best cadet, he was always first in everything. Why did he have to be expelled? – for a single reason, because he was an intelligent boyThey were filling in the form for higher\npromotion, in which it is asked, “Do you believe in God?” He simply said, “I don’t know. I don’t know God, how can I believe or disbelieve?”\nDo you see how people’s intelligence is killed? A boy is being agnostic, and absolutely correct: he says, “I don’t know. And without knowing you ask me to believe?” Rather than answering him, they expelled him. Belief in God is absolutely necessary for every cadet.\nTricky ways of keeping people retarded!\nIn the first world war, for the first time, psychologists suggested that when soldiers were recruited their mental age should be checked. And they were all shocked, because the average mental age of all their soldiers was only thirteen years!\nThings have not changed. You may be eighty years old with a thirteen-year-old mind. Naturally you will find anguish, tension, worries. You will find yourself in a very confused situation. Your body is allowed to grow, your mind is stopped.\nFrom the very childhood you have to believe in some religion, in some absolutely fictitious ideas, ultimate lies. And once a child starts believing in ultimate lies, his intelligence stops growing.\nIn this commune and my other communes in the world, we don’t have a belief system, we don’t have any faith in which you have to be indoctrinated. We are allowing our people to be as deeply agnostic as possible.\nAnd why fear? If God is there and you enquire, question, you will find him. The fear is that if you doubt and inquire you will not find him. That’s why doubt has to be from the very beginning completely erased from your mind.\nDoubt is the method of science. Scientists are not afraid; they go on doubting and questioning every hypothesis, experimenting. And only if they come to some conclusion which is supported by evidence, supported by experiments, supported by intelligence, and you cannot doubt it, is it accepted.\nAnd then too, it is accepted only hypothetically, because perhaps tomorrow you may have better instruments, better minds, better people, and they may find some loopholes in it. They may find that something else is more accurate, more right.\nSo in science there is no belief, ever. Doubt brings you to a hypothesis. A hypothesis means, for the time being you believe in it – but only for the time being. If tomorrow somebody goes ahead and declares that we can move on, the old hypothesis is dissolved; then the new hypothesis takes its place until you come to something which is indubitable. But it is a great surprise. The moment you find the indubitable, you don’t believe in it, there is no need. It is your own experience.\nTruth needs no belief. Only lies need beliefs.\nThe whole young generation around the world is certainly at a great angry stage. But we have to make the young people aware... because if your leaders who have exploited you are still your leaders, they will exploit your anger too, they will direct it in wrong directions. And that is what is happening.\nIn India, my experience was that it was so easy to create a riot. For example, Mohammedans believe that music is something evil, so before their mosque you cannot go on playing music – a flute, or a band. You have to stop playing it, move silently before the mosque, and then you can start again. Even in marriages.…\nIn India, the marriage procession is something beautiful to see – music, danceBut if the marriage\nparty comes in front of a mosque and continues its music and dance, immediately there will be a riot. Soon Hindus will be killing Mohammedans, Mohammedans will be killing Hindus.\nIf you want to start a riot, then just hang a dead cow in front of a Hindu temple – the cow may have died by herself, that does not matter – and immediately you have put the whole city on fire.\nAnybody can do it! Politicians are continuously doing it. Religious leaders are continuously doing it. Whenever they see that the anger is turning towards them, they immediately do some small thing: the anger moves, and people destroy themselves.\nThe other thing to understand very deeply is, scientists have discovered that every animal has a territorial imperative. He has a certain territory; for example, around him for thirty yards nobody should enter. If you remain out of his territory, he will not in any way be upset by you, you can remain there. But the moment you trespass the boundary line, immediately the animal becomes dangerous.\nEvery animal has a territorial imperative. Man comes from animals. You all feel once in a while to be left alone. Always in the crowd... what happened to your territory? Why do you feel at ease in your home? Why do you feel beautiful in a vast forest or sitting on the beach seeing the immense ocean? It gives you a vast area around you, which is something very essential.\nBut the world is overcrowded. Wherever you are, you are in a crowd. And the world goes on becoming more and more overcrowded. This overcrowding is one of the psychological reasons why people are so on edge. Any moment, anything, and they are ready to fight – in three thousand years man has fought five thousand wars.\nEverybody is encroached upon; and the pope, the Hindu shankaracharya, the Mohammedan, Ayatollah Khomeini – they all go on preaching against birth control, against abortion, against the\npill. They want the world to be so crowded – and it will be so crowded – that there is not going to be any elbow room. There will not be any need to go to any meeting; wherever you are, you will be in a meeting. But these idiots keep saying around the world.…\nIndia is fifty percent ready to become another Ethiopia. In Ethiopia one thousand people have been dying every day for the whole year. Now it is no longer news at all, nobody bothers. It has been accepted that Ethiopians die, one thousand every day.\nThe same will soon be the case in India. The same will be the case in other Third World countries, because they are all growing so fast. And nobody is ready to tell these people that they are teaching simple nonsense.\nThe pope is in South Africa, where the birthrate is the highest in the world. People are utterly poor, and he is teaching them that they should not use any birth control methods; it is against God!\nBut there is not much difference between Ethiopia and America, because here also Reverend Falwell is teaching against abortion, against birth control. And what is the reason? – because God is sending people children and you prevent him. This is against God.\nBut I cannot understand that a small pill – God cannot remove it? He managed to part the ocean for Moses and his whole company to pass. He went against the law of nature, he managed to give birth to Jesus Christ without a father. He seems to be a skillful man. He can remove the pill! He can change the nature of the pill so that the woman who takes the pill gives birth to two children instead of none. Naturally, people will stop taking the pill, because this is dangerous! you cannot go against God. If God wants people, he can create them.\nThere are so many millions of planets around, so many solar systems, but only this earth is evolved to the point of human consciousness, only on this earth have there been a few people who have reached to the ultimate in consciousness – enlightenment.\nWhy destroy this earth? It has enriched the whole existence, and the rest of existence is empty. God can manage to send people to any other planet, any other place.\nBut no, Reverend Falwell wants God to go on sending more people here. Mother Teresa wants more people here. The pope wants more people here, because these poor people are vulnerable, ready to become Christians, Catholics. These poor people and their children will be on the streets, and Mother Teresa can gather the orphans and make the Catholics.\nThese people go on distracting you from the real problems. Now, the pope in South Africa.The\nreal problem in South Africa is that fifteen percent of the population, the white people – who are all foreigners – are dominating the country. Eighty-five percent of the people are slaves, and the country belongs to them! They don’t have even the voting rights. Naturally, the fifteen percent, the white people, cannot stay a single moment more if those eighty-five percent of the people have voting power.\nThe fifteen percent who are white have all the riches of the country. South Africa is one of the richest places, with gold minds, silver mines, diamond mines. But all those mines are under the control of\nthe white people. The people to whom the country belongs are so poor, and the pope is preaching to those poor to become more poor, because from there he recruits his Catholics.\nPoor people are needed because the religions cannot convert rich people. The uneducated are needed, the orphans are needed because Christians cannot get hold of the educated people. Their own educated young people are getting out of hand. Their churches are empty, the young generation does not go there anymore. They need to fill their churches, their congregations, and their numbers must come from poor countries.\nAnd the poor people cannot argue against what they are saying, that God sends people. It has been accepted for centuries that God sends people.\nNobody knows about God, and if he is omnipotent, all-powerful, then whatever you do – any birth control method, anything, abortion, he is all-powerful – can’t he do something so that you cannot prevent him from sending people?\nGod cannot do anything because he does not exist!\nThese reverends and popes and bishops, these are the people who want the world to become as poor as possible – because the poor man is ready to pray, he is ready to go to the church. The poor man is always ready for paradise, heaven, hell. He has no guts, no intelligence to deny anything.\nAlready he is so much in suffering, how can he deny the existence of paradise? That is his only hope, that after death.It is only a question of a few years more of suffering, and then there is an\neternity of pleasures – all the pleasures that religions deny here, renounce here! Strange argument... strange logic.\nMohammedans are not allowed to drink alcoholic beverages here on the earth, but in their heaven there are rivers of wine, champagne, and all kinds of alcoholic beverages which you can choose. Rivers flowing, not bottles! You can drink, you can jump in, you can swim, you can drown – you can do anything!\nHere, alcohol is a sin. Can’t you see the stupidity of the logic? Here it is sin. Those who don’t drink will become virtuous, they will enter paradise. And there, these saints will be rewarded with beautiful women who always remain young, who do not perspire, who do not need any deodorant; they are always fresh and always virgin. Their virginity is unspoilable; all the saints can make love to them, they are still virgin.\nYour saints who renounced here on the earth the woman, the home, the family and all comforts, and lived in poverty – you reward them with these things?\nAs far as I can see, these saints will be simply shocked when they enter paradise, that other popes are making love under the trees. They will not be able to believe it.\nI have heard about one thing.… An old saint died. His whole teaching was celibacy. And after a few days one of his chief disciples died. The disciple was very excited that he would be meeting his master again. He enquired about him. People showed him: “You will find him under that tree\nnear the river. Perhaps he may recognize you, or he may not recognize you because he is so drunk. Somehow we have pulled him out of the river.”\nOne thing is good: you cannot die in heaven, there is no death; so you can drown but you will live. There is no way to commit suicide in heaven. “We have just pulled him out. He is lying there under the tree.”\nThe disciple rushed there – he could not believe his eyes. He closed his eyes, because his old master, naked, had a beautiful woman in his lap, holding her and playing with her, swaying with her. He could not believe it. But then he thought, “Perhaps this is the reward for my master’s great celibacy, renunciation, living in poverty, torture. This must be...” because such a beautiful woman he had never seen.\nHe just fell down at the feet of the master, and said, “Master, you are well rewarded.”\nBefore the master could speak, the woman said, “You idiot, you don’t understand anything! He is not being rewarded, I am being punished!”\nBut the poor people have always hoped for heaven. That hope keeps them suffering patiently; otherwise, there is no reason for them to suffer. Just a little understanding.…\nThe population has to go down; and immediately, with the population going down, all these atrocities will stop.\nPeople need space. Everybody needs a certain space; that space gives him a certain spiritual freedom. Everybody wants to live comfortably, luxuriously – that is natural. But this small earth cannot support so many people.\nPopes, Ayatollah Khomeini, shankaracharyas, Reverend Falwell – all these people should be behind bars, sentenced for their whole life. These people are wild animals let loose in the world! They should be first tamed, and if they are tamed they can enter a circus – but not the world again.\nThe world’s population has to be one fourth of what it is. Then everybody will have space, everybody will have enough – more than enough; everybody will be satisfied, contented, nourished.\nAnd the world needs only one thing – not great scriptures, just a simple method of becoming silent, of becoming yourself, of coming to your innermost center. That center is the temple, the synagogue, the church. There is no other church, no other synagogue.\nDon’t go anywhere. Go inside, inward.\nAnd there is your paradise, your wisdom, your eternal life.\nA man who knows his wisdom and his eternal life cannot behave the way people are behaving all around the world.\nEvery politician should be forced to participate in some school of meditation, and unless he graduates from there he cannot stand for any political post. All politicians, unless they are meditative, are disqualified. If they have any sense of dignity they should renounce, they should immediately resign from their posts. They don’t know themselves, what are they doing there? They don’t know themselves and they are controlling millions of people and their lives.\nMy religion consists only of one word: meditativeness. It has no prayer, because there is nobody to whom you can pray. You are here, a reality. Why not go in and find out from where your life comes, the source of your life? the source of your intelligence? the source of your love?\nGo deep inside, and you will be surprised that hate, anger, jealousy all exist only on the periphery. In the innermost center of your being there is only love and love and love. And it blossoms the moment you reach there, and spreads all over your periphery.\nAnd just as when you bring light in a dark room, darkness disappears, the moment you bring your silence, your peace, your love to your periphery, all the darkness that consisted of jealousy, violence, hatred, anger, competitiveness, disappears. You have not to do anything about it, you have not to control it: it is not there at all.\nYou cannot control darkness. Either it is there, or you bring a candle in, or light a candle which is already there. And after the light you never ask, “What to do about the darkness now?” It simply is not found.\nHumanity has only one saving device available, and that is meditation. Everything else has failed:\nGive a try to meditation.\nI told you, in four years’ time there has not been any illegal act here. The reason is, people are meditating. There is no competition, no stealing, no hurting anybody. Nobody feels himself higher than the other. And we are not teaching equality, we are not communists. Communism is outdated.\nWe are teaching meditativeness, and the feeling of equality arises of its own accord. You need not have a dictatorship of the proletariat to enforce equality on people. Any enforced thing is not going to last long, because deep down whatever you have repressed is there. And it is gathering more and more energy, it is becoming a cancer. Equality cannot be imposed.\nBut a loving person does not feel himself superior to anybody or inferior to anybody. These two complexes, inferiority complex and superiority complex, simply disappear from his being. He is just like a tree or a cloud or a mountain, enjoying his being.\nAnd the moment you start enjoying your being, rejoicing in your being, you cannot hurt anybody. It is impossible. You can hurt somebody only if you are yourself hurting, if you are carrying wounds within you. When you are healed and whole, your vision about everybody else simply changes. You cannot condemn, you cannot humiliate anybody. Your love will not allow you to do that.\nThrough meditation we have to create communes around the world – we have many already. We have to create them in every country.\nIn countries like the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, East Germany, China, where creating a commune will be almost impossible, we are creating underground communes. There are sannyasins in every communist country. They meditate in basements, they read books, they listen to the tapes – and they are immensely excited because for sixty years they have been repressed.\nCommunist Russia is the only country where revolution is almost impossible. Strange fate of a revolutionary country where the greatest revolution happened in 1917! But after that, they say “Revolution has happened, now there is no need for any complaint.”\nAnd the moment they suspect anybody, that he can sabotage the society, the man simply disappears. He is killed, imprisoned, poisoned, sent to a madhouse where they go on injecting chemicals into him which make him mad; or he is sent to Siberia where there are eternal snows and he cannot escape, there is no need even to chain him.\nBut the youth.Wherever there is youth there is always a romance with revolution, with change.\nRussian youth for seventy years has not tasted youthfulness. It has been missing one of the most beautiful experiences – of being in love with a revolutionary idea. You will be surprised to know that meditation is for them a revolutionary idea. In other communist countries the same is the case.\nIn other countries which are not communist, we are creating our communes. And we want our communes to be models for others to see that people can live without crime, without murder, without suicide, without frustration. People can be creative, people can be loving and friendly. And people can rejoice for no reason at all – just for the sake of rejoicing.\nIf we can make these existential experiments available to the whole humanity, there is a hope that we can free them from the long, long bondage of politicians and priests. In the future, if humanity is to exist, then politicians and priests are not to exist. We have to make a clear choice.\nOn one side is the whole humanity of innocent people, and on the other side is the company of all the criminals and conspirators against humanity: the politicians, the priests.\nAnd the time has come. We have come to an ultimate crisis where decision is possible. Politicians gone, nations are gone.\nPriests gone, there is only one humanity.\nAnd then every university can become a place, not only to teach you geography – which is stupid – history – which is just rubbish; but to teach you something very essential: meditation, love, the art of living, the art of being human.\nEach university should become a temple of wisdom; it is not yet. It is called a university but it is not a university, because it is not universal – just a name. Inside.… I cannot believe it: there are Catholic universities, Mohammedan universities, Hindu universities! It seems man has gone mad.\nThe universe is not Mohammedan, not Hindu nor Catholic. The universities should be completely free of all politics, all religions, but they should teach you the basic arts of being human – which has not been done up to now. That’s why there are so many atrocities, so many inhuman acts against human beings.\nWhat man has done to man is inconceivable. Just Adolf Hitler alone is responsible for killing at least ten million people. Joseph Stalin is not far behind. In the twentieth century, are you going to allow all this to go on?\nNo, we are not going to allow it anymore.\nOur ways of changing this world are certainly different. We are not going to create nuclear weapons to conquer the world and change it, no.\nWe have already the greatest weapon in our hands: meditation. Spread it far and wide to everyone you love, to everyone you know.\nDon’t tell anybody that it is something to be believed in. Just say, “I experimented, and it is something not to be missed. You experiment. There is nothing to lose. If you don’t get anything out of it, you have not lost anything. And it is such a simple thing that everybody, even a small child, can start doing it. And it can be done even by the dying man in the last moment of his life.”\nAnd if a dying man can do it, can reach his center, he will know that death is happening only to the house in which he used to live, but he is not going to die. He will know his eternity, his immortality. And that knowledge, that wisdom is the greatest richness that one can achieve.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nI HAVE BEEN A SANNYASIN FOR ELEVEN YEARS. NEVER IN MY LIFE HAVE I BEEN AS HAPPY AS NOW. BUT WHEN I LISTEN TO YOU LATELY, I FEEL THAT I HAVE NEVER REALLY GONE INSIDE. IS THIS POSSIBLE?\nNot only possible, it is absolutely certain.\nJust being happy is nothing. It is dangerous too, because somebody who is unhappy at least tries to find some way to get out of it.\nYou have been a sannyasin for eleven years. Naturally – my people are immensely happy people, and happiness is catching – you are caught by the happiness of everybody. And there is no reason to be sad here, there is no reason to be frustrated here, there is no reason to be disappointed here. But this happiness is not what I call blissfulness. This happiness is good, but just good is not enough.\nYou will have to enter into yourself.\nAnd remember, in entering into yourself you are not going to lose your happiness. You are fortunate, because the person who starts from unhappiness will have to lose unhappiness.\nYou are not going to lose anything.\nYou will find more and more happiness.\nAnd you will find the happiness turning, changing into blissfulness, and finally into enlightenment. You are on the right track, but you are not moving!\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"6966","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/from_death_to_deathlessness/part31/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/from_death_to_deathlessness/>From Death to Deathlessness</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">31 The art of being human</h1><div class=post-meta>33 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;6966 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/From_Death_to_Deathlessness/part31.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part30>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

AT THE PRESENT TIME –
ESPECIALLY IN THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES – REPORTS ARE SURFACING EVERY DAY OF
UNBELIEVABLE ATROCITIES COMMITTED BY MAN AGAINST MAN. FROM WHERE DOES
THIS DESIRE TO TORTURE OTHERS ARISE? DO SUCH PERVERTED ACTS STEM FROM A
DEEP SENSE OF FRUSTRATION AND THE NEED TO TAKE REVENGE AGAINST SOCIETY?
PLEASE COMMENT.</p><p><br></p><p>Man’s whole history is a history of torture, murder, rape. But in the
past it was not possible to know about the whole world, what was
happening; people knew only about local things. Now the earth has become
so small that within minutes, wherever anything happens, it spreads all
over the world. The media has made people aware of man’s reality. In the
past it remained hidden. Now it has surfaced.</p><p><br></p><p>There are reasons why man is so inhuman. The reasons are many, but
the few most important ones should be understood.</p><p><br></p><p>One, all the religions of the world have been teaching unnatural
things to humanity – celibacy, renouncing the pleasures and comforts of
life, living in poverty. For centuries they have been telling these
things to people, and they have kept the people uneducated,
illiterate.</p><p>But an explosion in the contemporary world of education has created a
tremendous problem. Now people know that what has been told to them was
not right – it was not according to nature, it was against nature. They
are full of rage against the whole past.</p><p><br></p><p>The religions have corrupted their minds, have led them to perverted
sexual practices. The religions have put one man against another. There
are three hundred religions on the earth, and each claims that it is the
only ultimate truth, all others are false.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, anybody who has a little intelligence can see the point that
there can be only one kind of religiousness, unnamed – just like
science. You don’t call it Jewish science, Mohammedan science, Hindu
science, Christian science. Just to call it science is enough; its rules
are universal.</p><p><br></p><p>Religion is the science of the inner world. Its rules also are
universal.</p><p><br></p><p>But these three hundred religions have been teaching you just the
opposite. They have been teaching you rituals which don’t lead you
inside. They have been teaching you about a God who lives above the
clouds; nobody has seen him. They have been teaching you commandments
written three thousand years ago, written five thousand years ago –
written, and you have to live according to them.</p><p><br></p><p>They have encaged you.</p><p><br></p><p>In every possible way you are chained – not only your body, but your
spirit.</p><p><br></p><p>Hence, everywhere atrocities are surfacing. They have been surfacing
down the ages, but the media to inform you about the reality that is
happening all around the earth was missing. Education was missing. Now
you are educated, whether you are a Jew or a Christian or a Hindu or a
Buddhist, in the same way, in the same science, the same laws.</p><p><br></p><p>In every way science has made the whole humanity one. But religions
go on carrying the hangover of the past, dividing man against man.</p><p><br></p><p>The violence that they have repressed for centuries has come to a
climax. The people want to take revenge, because they have been
mistreated, they have been deceived by the people they have trusted – by
their prophets, their messiahs, their incarnations of God.</p><p><br></p><p>These people have been the greatest criminals. They divided
humanity.</p><p>They divided you, split you into body and soul: you have to torture
your body if you want to know the soul. So for thousands of years people
have been torturing their bodies; that was the only way to become
saintly. But now it is difficult to convince people that by torturing
their bodies they will become holy. There seems to be no sense in
it.</p><p><br></p><p>Man has been divided into man and woman. Half of humanity consists of
women, and they have lived a life of slavery, torture, indignity. They
are rebelling.</p><p>Man is rebelling against the past unconsciously. He is enraged by the
whole human history. And he is so full of anger, violence, that any
small thing brings it up, and it starts spreading like a wildfire.</p><p><br></p><p>Secondly, man is tremendously frustrated because the leaders of
mankind in the past have been giving him hope, hope of a paradise beyond
death. Not a single person has returned after death and given his
eyewitness evidence that there is a paradise, that there is a God, that
your acts will be judged – you will be thrown into eternal hell or into
the eternal blissfulness of paradise.</p><p><br></p><p>Nobody has ever returned. Nobody knows anything about life after
death, and people have been sacrificing their present for an unknown
future. Now they cannot do it anymore, they have done enough. They want
paradise here and now. The leaders cannot supply the goods that they
have been promising them. Beyond death, of course, they are ready to
give you anything you want, but people want it now. That creates a great
hopelessness, frustration, meaninglessness.</p><p><br></p><p>People have not been taught the art of living beautifully, the art of
being graceful, the art of being silent, meditative. Instead of teaching
these authentic realities which can be done right now, their minds were
taken away from the present to some unknown future – nobody knows
whether it exists or not.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, because people become literate, educated, they can see the great
deceit. They have been cheated, and a great anger is there. Not only
their life but millions of lives for centuries have been exploited by
these cheaters.</p><p><br></p><p>Religious priests have parasites sucking your blood. Now it is
absolutely impossible for those religions to exist anymore. They should
disappear gracefully, and allow a new way of life which is centered in
the present, so that something can be done to the human psychology.</p><p><br></p><p>Man has immense capacity to love.</p><p><br></p><p>If his love is given freedom, he will never commit anything that goes
against love. Man has immense capacity to be compassionate.</p><p>He will not commit violence on any slight excuse. But he has to be
awakened!</p><p>The religions have been giving him opium, and for thousands of years
they have made him completely unconscious. It was good for them – they
could exploit people easily.</p><p><br></p><p>All the vested interests were together: the politician, the priest,
the pedagogue, all were together, because if man becomes awake then
there is no need for politicians; he will see them as criminals. There
is no need for priests; he will see them as the greatest cheats that
have existed ever.</p><p><br></p><p>These priests have been telling people, “Blessed are the poor.” They
themselves are not poor – pope the Polack is the richest man in the
world. But nobody asks him the question, “Blessed are the poor – so what
the hell are you doing in the Vatican? Go to Calcutta and start begging
on the streets! –</p><p>because if you remain the pope you will be the last to enter into
paradise, and perhaps you will be thrown into hell.”</p><p><br></p><p>The pope goes on quoting Jesus Christ, and for centuries you have
listened to, “Blessed are the poor.” The rich are cursed, because even a
camel can pass through the eye of a needle, but the rich man cannot pass
through the gates of paradise.</p><p><br></p><p>And why are people poor? Every religion has given some explanation,
has to give one. The Christians are poor because God is very loving to
you. You are the blessed; he is preparing you for paradise. This is a
test of your trust.</p><p><br></p><p>In India, Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism have been telling people, “You
are poor because in your past life you committed some grave sins, some
evil acts, and this is the punishment. Don’t do anything wrong in this
life. Patiently suffer, gracefully accept the punishment – in the next
life you will be rich.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now this is distracting people from the reality. The reality is that
they are being exploited in this life, right now.</p><p><br></p><p>And the explanation is really far-fetched. In a past life you put
your hand on a candle flame – you did not burn yourself then, but you
have a burned hand! Nobody knows about the past life; and cause and
effect cannot be so distant. You do something, you hit your head against
the wall and you will suffer now. You put your hand in the fire and you
will be burned now. There is no explanation why the result comes in the
next life.</p><p><br></p><p>So either past lives have been taken as an explanation to the poor,
to give them consolation that they deserve this poverty; or God has to
be brought in, that he is testing your trust. Strangely enough... why is
he not testing the rich people? Why is he against the rich people?</p><p><br></p><p>And in Christianity, Mohammedanism, Judaism, there is only one life.
So the rich person is born without any past life in which he would have
committed some evil acts; that’s why God has not given him the test of
trust and has taken away the opportunity of entering into paradise.</p><p><br></p><p>A strange God! He makes people rich, comfortable, luxurious, because
he is against them. But why is he against them? They have not done
anything. This is their only life! Why has he chosen a few people to be
rich, and many people to be poor?</p><p><br></p><p>All these explanations are bogus; and the contemporary mind is
becoming clear about all these explanations, that they were strategies
to keep the poor, poor, and to make the rich, richer.</p><p><br></p><p>In a country like India no revolution has ever happened, although the
whole country is poor. In the hands of only a few families all the
riches of the country have gathered. The whole country is starving,
hungry, but they have accepted it patiently up to now.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a limit to everything. Now they are burning. They know they
have been cheated, badly cheated. So there are going to be riots, there
are going to be killings. And the responsibility goes to your prophets,
your messiahs, your messengers of God – and finally, to God. If God
exists anywhere, he is the greatest criminal. To create a world with so
much hatred, anger, rage, violence.…</p><p>This is something strange. You make something wrong, and if it
behaves wrongly then you punish it. Who has made you a sexual being? If
God wanted celibacy, there was no problem for him. If he can create the
whole world within six days, can’t he manage that man is born without
sex, without greed, without jealousy, without anger, without hate? No,
He has made a man full of all these things. And anger, hate, jealousy
you need not learn; they are instinctive, they are God-given.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation you will have to learn – God has not given that to you.
This God must be nuts! He has not given you the most precious thing: the
art of knowing yourself. In fact, he was against all knowledge. He
prevented Adam and Eve from eating from the tree of knowledge and from
eating from the tree of eternal life.</p><p><br></p><p>Can you think of this God as divine, who is preventing his children
from wisdom and from the taste of eternal life? These are the two things
that he should have insisted on: “First taste these two trees, and then
the whole Garden of Eden is yours.”</p><p><br></p><p>But this God is the invention of the vested interests. The priests
never wanted people to be educated, they never wanted the people to
become intelligent, because there was danger. In their education, in
their intelligence the people will start asking questions. And the
priests don’t have any authentic answers, because all that the priests
have created in the name of religion is fiction – and ugly fiction.</p><p><br></p><p>Now the new generation is becoming aware everywhere that this God has
to be dropped. Nietzsche said, “God is dead and man is free.” But the
younger generation wants God not to be dead, they want to murder him.
Just an easy death does not appeal; they want to murder him. And you
will see your temples, your synagogues, your churches on fire soon! Your
Bible, your holy Koran, your holy Gita – you will soon see in
bonfires.</p><p><br></p><p>Man has come of age, he is mature.</p><p><br></p><p>He can see how he has been deceived, and he has to destroy everything
that has deceived him.</p><p><br></p><p>But the priests are very cunning; cunningness is their profession.
They are professional exploiters, parasites, because for centuries they
have done nothing else; they have become very skillful. So rather than
allowing you to burn the Bible, to burn the Vatican, to kill God, they
go on diverting you – Christians against Mohammedans, Mohammedans
against Hindus, Hindus against Buddhists. And you are so full of rage
that you have lost all reason, you simply want to destroy. And the
priests are using this situation. If they don’t use it, you will destroy
them!</p><p><br></p><p>So all over the world religions are fighting, nations are fighting,
races are fighting. Who is creating all this? The people who have
dominated you for centuries know perfectly well that your anger, your
hatred has to be diverted; otherwise, they will be the targets.</p><p><br></p><p>They are all against me for a single reason – that I want your rage
to go in the right direction. I don’t want to divert it. I want you to
meditate and in silence see what has been done to man in the whole
history. And out of your silence and peace, if you feel that something
has to be destroyed because it has been hindering the growth of man, his
consciousness, that destruction will be totally different.</p><p><br></p><p>It will not be of people. If will be of your holy books, it will be
of your holy places, it will be of your synagogues, churches, mosques.
It will not be directed to other human beings who belong to other</p><p>groups. It will not be between Americans and Soviet people – they
both have been exploited by different kinds of priests.</p><p><br></p><p>Communism is the latest religion.</p><p><br></p><p>It has its own priests, it has its own holy DAS KAPITAL. It has its
own holy place of pilgrimage – the Kremlin. It has its own trinity –
Marx, Engels, Lenin. It has replaced the old religion.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no need for Americans to destroy Russians, or Russians to
destroy Americans. If we are intelligent, all the politicians – Russians
and Americans – should be imprisoned immediately. And the masses can do
it! They just have to be awakened as to who is the real enemy.</p><p><br></p><p>Boundaries of the countries should be dissolved. They don’t exist on
the earth, only on the map. The whole humanity is one, and the whole
humanity should pool all its energies. And we can make this earth a
paradise.…</p><p><br></p><p>You can see this small commune – only five thousand people are living
here, and within four years we have changed the desert into an oasis. We
are growing our food, our vegetables, our milk products; we are
self-sufficient. And in four years not a single crime has happened.
Nobody has been beaten, nobody has been raped, nobody has committed
suicide, nobody has been murdered.</p><p><br></p><p>Five thousand people living together have pooled their energies. One
kitchen is enough for five thousand people. Naturally, it saves
immensely in money, in human power. Otherwise, there would have been at
least one thousand kitchens, one thousand women would have been doing
just one thing. Now only a few women manage; and far better food is
provided to the commune than you can get from a nagging wife.</p><p><br></p><p>We are living comfortably, we are enjoying everything that is
beautiful. We are rejoicing, dancing, singing – you will not see long
faces here. And nobody is bothered about God – strange! Nobody is
bothered about heaven and hell. Those are stupid questions. Why waste
your intelligence on stupid questions?</p><p><br></p><p>People are concerned with how to be more creative, how to produce
more, how to make the commune absolutely self-sufficient so that even if
the whole world suddenly disappears leaving this commune alone, there
will be no problem.</p><p><br></p><p>You say, “Everywhere atrocities are surfacing” – please, exclude my
commune! There are no atrocities here.</p><p><br></p><p>People are so loving, so compassionate – they just need to be made
aware of their great potential. People are intelligent – they just have
to be given a chance to sharpen their intelligence.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole world has been fed with the idea of belief. All the
religions want you to believe, have faith. That destroys your
intelligence. That’s their way of destroying your intelligence, keeping
you retarded.</p><p><br></p><p>In my commune, belief is non-existent.</p><p>We trust in doubt, because doubt sharpens intelligence, it creates
questions for which you have to find answers. This is the way your
intelligence becomes sharp. We teach doubt, we teach skepticism, we
teach agnosticism. Agnosticism means, be sincere about one thing – what
you know and what you don’t know. And if you don’t know something,
accept it, that “I don’t know.”</p><p><br></p><p>This will be punished in the outside world. The outside world
respects hypocrites. Whether you know or not, you have to pretend that
you know.</p><p><br></p><p>The American scouts have just rejected and expelled one brilliant
young man – just fourteen years of age. He was their best cadet, he was
always first in everything. Why did he have to be expelled? – for a
single reason, because he was an intelligent boy<span class=s4></span>They were filling in the form for higher</p><p>promotion, in which it is asked, “Do you believe in God?” He simply
said, “I don’t know. I don’t know God, how can I believe or
disbelieve?”</p><p><br></p><p>Do you see how people’s intelligence is killed? A boy is being
agnostic, and absolutely correct: he says, “I don’t know. And without
knowing you ask me to believe?” Rather than answering him, they expelled
him. Belief in God is absolutely necessary for every cadet.</p><p><br></p><p>Tricky ways of keeping people retarded!</p><p><br></p><p>In the first world war, for the first time, psychologists suggested
that when soldiers were recruited their mental age should be checked.
And they were all shocked, because the average mental age of all their
soldiers was only thirteen years!</p><p><br></p><p>Things have not changed. You may be eighty years old with a
thirteen-year-old mind. Naturally you will find anguish, tension,
worries. You will find yourself in a very confused situation. Your body
is allowed to grow, your mind is stopped.</p><p><br></p><p>From the very childhood you have to believe in some religion, in some
absolutely fictitious ideas, ultimate lies. And once a child starts
believing in ultimate lies, his intelligence stops growing.</p><p><br></p><p>In this commune and my other communes in the world, we don’t have a
belief system, we don’t have any faith in which you have to be
indoctrinated. We are allowing our people to be as deeply agnostic as
possible.</p><p><br></p><p>And why fear? If God is there and you enquire, question, you will
find him. The fear is that if you doubt and inquire you will not find
him. That’s why doubt has to be from the very beginning completely
erased from your mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Doubt is the method of science. Scientists are not afraid; they go on
doubting and questioning every hypothesis, experimenting. And only if
they come to some conclusion which is supported by evidence, supported
by experiments, supported by intelligence, and you cannot doubt it, is
it accepted.</p><p><br></p><p>And then too, it is accepted only hypothetically, because perhaps
tomorrow you may have better instruments, better minds, better people,
and they may find some loopholes in it. They may find that something
else is more accurate, more right.</p><p>So in science there is no belief, ever. Doubt brings you to a
hypothesis. A hypothesis means, for the time being you believe in it –
but only for the time being. If tomorrow somebody goes ahead and
declares that we can move on, the old hypothesis is dissolved; then the
new hypothesis takes its place until you come to something which is
indubitable. But it is a great surprise. The moment you find the
indubitable, you don’t believe in it, there is no need. It is your own
experience.</p><p><br></p><p>Truth needs no belief. Only lies need beliefs.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole young generation around the world is certainly at a great
angry stage. But we have to make the young people aware... because if
your leaders who have exploited you are still your leaders, they will
exploit your anger too, they will direct it in wrong directions. And
that is what is happening.</p><p><br></p><p>In India, my experience was that it was so easy to create a riot. For
example, Mohammedans believe that music is something evil, so before
their mosque you cannot go on playing music – a flute, or a band. You
have to stop playing it, move silently before the mosque, and then you
can start again. Even in marriages.…</p><p><br></p><p>In India, the marriage procession is something beautiful to see –
music, dance<span class=s4></span>But if the marriage</p><p>party comes in front of a mosque and continues its music and dance,
immediately there will be a riot. Soon Hindus will be killing
Mohammedans, Mohammedans will be killing Hindus.</p><p><br></p><p>If you want to start a riot, then just hang a dead cow in front of a
Hindu temple – the cow may have died by herself, that does not matter –
and immediately you have put the whole city on fire.</p><p><br></p><p>Anybody can do it! Politicians are continuously doing it. Religious
leaders are continuously doing it. Whenever they see that the anger is
turning towards them, they immediately do some small thing: the anger
moves, and people destroy themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>The other thing to understand very deeply is, scientists have
discovered that every animal has a territorial imperative. He has a
certain territory; for example, around him for thirty yards nobody
should enter. If you remain out of his territory, he will not in any way
be upset by you, you can remain there. But the moment you trespass the
boundary line, immediately the animal becomes dangerous.</p><p><br></p><p>Every animal has a territorial imperative. Man comes from animals.
You all feel once in a while to be left alone. Always in the crowd...
what happened to your territory? Why do you feel at ease in your home?
Why do you feel beautiful in a vast forest or sitting on the beach
seeing the immense ocean? It gives you a vast area around you, which is
something very essential.</p><p><br></p><p>But the world is overcrowded. Wherever you are, you are in a crowd.
And the world goes on becoming more and more overcrowded. This
overcrowding is one of the psychological reasons why people are so on
edge. Any moment, anything, and they are ready to fight – in three
thousand years man has fought five thousand wars.</p><p><br></p><p>Everybody is encroached upon; and the pope, the Hindu shankaracharya,
the Mohammedan, Ayatollah Khomeini – they all go on preaching against
birth control, against abortion, against the</p><p>pill. They want the world to be so crowded – and it will be so
crowded – that there is not going to be any elbow room. There will not
be any need to go to any meeting; wherever you are, you will be in a
meeting. But these idiots keep saying around the world.…</p><p><br></p><p>India is fifty percent ready to become another Ethiopia. In Ethiopia
one thousand people have been dying every day for the whole year. Now it
is no longer news at all, nobody bothers. It has been accepted that
Ethiopians die, one thousand every day.</p><p><br></p><p>The same will soon be the case in India. The same will be the case in
other Third World countries, because they are all growing so fast. And
nobody is ready to tell these people that they are teaching simple
nonsense.</p><p><br></p><p>The pope is in South Africa, where the birthrate is the highest in
the world. People are utterly poor, and he is teaching them that they
should not use any birth control methods; it is against God!</p><p><br></p><p>But there is not much difference between Ethiopia and America,
because here also Reverend Falwell is teaching against abortion, against
birth control. And what is the reason? – because God is sending people
children and you prevent him. This is against God.</p><p><br></p><p>But I cannot understand that a small pill – God cannot remove it? He
managed to part the ocean for Moses and his whole company to pass. He
went against the law of nature, he managed to give birth to Jesus Christ
without a father. He seems to be a skillful man. He can remove the pill!
He can change the nature of the pill so that the woman who takes the
pill gives birth to two children instead of none. Naturally, people will
stop taking the pill, because this is dangerous! you cannot go against
God. If God wants people, he can create them.</p><p><br></p><p>There are so many millions of planets around, so many solar systems,
but only this earth is evolved to the point of human consciousness, only
on this earth have there been a few people who have reached to the
ultimate in consciousness – enlightenment.</p><p><br></p><p>Why destroy this earth? It has enriched the whole existence, and the
rest of existence is empty. God can manage to send people to any other
planet, any other place.</p><p><br></p><p>But no, Reverend Falwell wants God to go on sending more people here.
Mother Teresa wants more people here. The pope wants more people here,
because these poor people are vulnerable, ready to become Christians,
Catholics. These poor people and their children will be on the streets,
and Mother Teresa can gather the orphans and make the Catholics.</p><p><br></p><p>These people go on distracting you from the real problems. Now, the
pope in South Africa.<span class=s4></span>The</p><p>real problem in South Africa is that fifteen percent of the
population, the white people – who are all foreigners – are dominating
the country. Eighty-five percent of the people are slaves, and the
country belongs to them! They don’t have even the voting rights.
Naturally, the fifteen percent, the white people, cannot stay a single
moment more if those eighty-five percent of the people have voting
power.</p><p><br></p><p>The fifteen percent who are white have all the riches of the country.
South Africa is one of the richest places, with gold minds, silver
mines, diamond mines. But all those mines are under the control of</p><p>the white people. The people to whom the country belongs are so poor,
and the pope is preaching to those poor to become more poor, because
from there he recruits his Catholics.</p><p><br></p><p>Poor people are needed because the religions cannot convert rich
people. The uneducated are needed, the orphans are needed because
Christians cannot get hold of the educated people. Their own educated
young people are getting out of hand. Their churches are empty, the
young generation does not go there anymore. They need to fill their
churches, their congregations, and their numbers must come from poor
countries.</p><p><br></p><p>And the poor people cannot argue against what they are saying, that
God sends people. It has been accepted for centuries that God sends
people.</p><p><br></p><p>Nobody knows about God, and if he is omnipotent, all-powerful, then
whatever you do – any birth control method, anything, abortion, he is
all-powerful – can’t he do something so that you cannot prevent him from
sending people?</p><p><br></p><p>God cannot do anything because he does not exist!</p><p><br></p><p>These reverends and popes and bishops, these are the people who want
the world to become as poor as possible – because the poor man is ready
to pray, he is ready to go to the church. The poor man is always ready
for paradise, heaven, hell. He has no guts, no intelligence to deny
anything.</p><p><br></p><p>Already he is so much in suffering, how can he deny the existence of
paradise? That is his only hope, that after death.<span class=s4></span>It is only a question of a few years more of
suffering, and then there is an</p><p>eternity of pleasures – all the pleasures that religions deny here,
renounce here! Strange argument... strange logic.</p><p><br></p><p>Mohammedans are not allowed to drink alcoholic beverages here on the
earth, but in their heaven there are rivers of wine, champagne, and all
kinds of alcoholic beverages which you can choose. Rivers flowing, not
bottles! You can drink, you can jump in, you can swim, you can drown –
you can do anything!</p><p><br></p><p>Here, alcohol is a sin. Can’t you see the stupidity of the logic?
Here it is sin. Those who don’t drink will become virtuous, they will
enter paradise. And there, these saints will be rewarded with beautiful
women who always remain young, who do not perspire, who do not need any
deodorant; they are always fresh and always virgin. Their virginity is
unspoilable; all the saints can make love to them, they are still
virgin.</p><p><br></p><p>Your saints who renounced here on the earth the woman, the home, the
family and all comforts, and lived in poverty – you reward them with
these things?</p><p><br></p><p>As far as I can see, these saints will be simply shocked when they
enter paradise, that other popes are making love under the trees. They
will not be able to believe it.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard about one thing.… An old saint died. His whole teaching
was celibacy. And after a few days one of his chief disciples died. The
disciple was very excited that he would be meeting his master again. He
enquired about him. People showed him: “You will find him under that
tree</p><p>near the river. Perhaps he may recognize you, or he may not recognize
you because he is so drunk. Somehow we have pulled him out of the
river.”</p><p><br></p><p>One thing is good: you cannot die in heaven, there is no death; so
you can drown but you will live. There is no way to commit suicide in
heaven. “We have just pulled him out. He is lying there under the
tree.”</p><p><br></p><p>The disciple rushed there – he could not believe his eyes. He closed
his eyes, because his old master, naked, had a beautiful woman in his
lap, holding her and playing with her, swaying with her. He could not
believe it. But then he thought, “Perhaps this is the reward for my
master’s great celibacy, renunciation, living in poverty, torture. This
must be...” because such a beautiful woman he had never seen.</p><p><br></p><p>He just fell down at the feet of the master, and said, “Master, you
are well rewarded.”</p><p><br></p><p>Before the master could speak, the woman said, “You idiot, you don’t
understand anything! He is not being rewarded, I am being punished!”</p><p><br></p><p>But the poor people have always hoped for heaven. That hope keeps
them suffering patiently; otherwise, there is no reason for them to
suffer. Just a little understanding.…</p><p><br></p><p>The population has to go down; and immediately, with the population
going down, all these atrocities will stop.</p><p><br></p><p>People need space. Everybody needs a certain space; that space gives
him a certain spiritual freedom. Everybody wants to live comfortably,
luxuriously – that is natural. But this small earth cannot support so
many people.</p><p><br></p><p>Popes, Ayatollah Khomeini, shankaracharyas, Reverend Falwell – all
these people should be behind bars, sentenced for their whole life.
These people are wild animals let loose in the world! They should be
first tamed, and if they are tamed they can enter a circus – but not the
world again.</p><p><br></p><p>The world’s population has to be one fourth of what it is. Then
everybody will have space, everybody will have enough – more than
enough; everybody will be satisfied, contented, nourished.</p><p><br></p><p>And the world needs only one thing – not great scriptures, just a
simple method of becoming silent, of becoming yourself, of coming to
your innermost center. That center is the temple, the synagogue, the
church. There is no other church, no other synagogue.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t go anywhere. Go inside, inward.</p><p>And there is your paradise, your wisdom, your eternal life.</p><p><br></p><p>A man who knows his wisdom and his eternal life cannot behave the way
people are behaving all around the world.</p><p>Every politician should be forced to participate in some school of
meditation, and unless he graduates from there he cannot stand for any
political post. All politicians, unless they are meditative, are
disqualified. If they have any sense of dignity they should renounce,
they should immediately resign from their posts. They don’t know
themselves, what are they doing there? They don’t know themselves and
they are controlling millions of people and their lives.</p><p><br></p><p>My religion consists only of one word: meditativeness. It has no
prayer, because there is nobody to whom you can pray. You are here, a
reality. Why not go in and find out from where your life comes, the
source of your life? the source of your intelligence? the source of your
love?</p><p><br></p><p>Go deep inside, and you will be surprised that hate, anger, jealousy
all exist only on the periphery. In the innermost center of your being
there is only love and love and love. And it blossoms the moment you
reach there, and spreads all over your periphery.</p><p><br></p><p>And just as when you bring light in a dark room, darkness disappears,
the moment you bring your silence, your peace, your love to your
periphery, all the darkness that consisted of jealousy, violence,
hatred, anger, competitiveness, disappears. You have not to do anything
about it, you have not to control it: it is not there at all.</p><p><br></p><p>You cannot control darkness. Either it is there, or you bring a
candle in, or light a candle which is already there. And after the light
you never ask, “What to do about the darkness now?” It simply is not
found.</p><p><br></p><p>Humanity has only one saving device available, and that is
meditation. Everything else has failed:</p><p>Give a try to meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>I told you, in four years’ time there has not been any illegal act
here. The reason is, people are meditating. There is no competition, no
stealing, no hurting anybody. Nobody feels himself higher than the
other. And we are not teaching equality, we are not communists.
Communism is outdated.</p><p><br></p><p>We are teaching meditativeness, and the feeling of equality arises of
its own accord. You need not have a dictatorship of the proletariat to
enforce equality on people. Any enforced thing is not going to last
long, because deep down whatever you have repressed is there. And it is
gathering more and more energy, it is becoming a cancer. Equality cannot
be imposed.</p><p><br></p><p>But a loving person does not feel himself superior to anybody or
inferior to anybody. These two complexes, inferiority complex and
superiority complex, simply disappear from his being. He is just like a
tree or a cloud or a mountain, enjoying his being.</p><p><br></p><p>And the moment you start enjoying your being, rejoicing in your
being, you cannot hurt anybody. It is impossible. You can hurt somebody
only if you are yourself hurting, if you are carrying wounds within you.
When you are healed and whole, your vision about everybody else simply
changes. You cannot condemn, you cannot humiliate anybody. Your love
will not allow you to do that.</p><p>Through meditation we have to create communes around the world – we
have many already. We have to create them in every country.</p><p><br></p><p>In countries like the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, East Germany, China,
where creating a commune will be almost impossible, we are creating
underground communes. There are sannyasins in every communist country.
They meditate in basements, they read books, they listen to the tapes –
and they are immensely excited because for sixty years they have been
repressed.</p><p><br></p><p>Communist Russia is the only country where revolution is almost
impossible. Strange fate of a revolutionary country where the greatest
revolution happened in 1917! But after that, they say “Revolution has
happened, now there is no need for any complaint.”</p><p><br></p><p>And the moment they suspect anybody, that he can sabotage the
society, the man simply disappears. He is killed, imprisoned, poisoned,
sent to a madhouse where they go on injecting chemicals into him which
make him mad; or he is sent to Siberia where there are eternal snows and
he cannot escape, there is no need even to chain him.</p><p><br></p><p>But the youth.<span class=s4></span>Wherever there is youth there
is always a romance with revolution, with change.</p><p>Russian youth for seventy years has not tasted youthfulness. It has
been missing one of the most beautiful experiences – of being in love
with a revolutionary idea. You will be surprised to know that meditation
is for them a revolutionary idea. In other communist countries the same
is the case.</p><p><br></p><p>In other countries which are not communist, we are creating our
communes. And we want our communes to be models for others to see that
people can live without crime, without murder, without suicide, without
frustration. People can be creative, people can be loving and friendly.
And people can rejoice for no reason at all – just for the sake of
rejoicing.</p><p><br></p><p>If we can make these existential experiments available to the whole
humanity, there is a hope that we can free them from the long, long
bondage of politicians and priests. In the future, if humanity is to
exist, then politicians and priests are not to exist. We have to make a
clear choice.</p><p><br></p><p>On one side is the whole humanity of innocent people, and on the
other side is the company of all the criminals and conspirators against
humanity: the politicians, the priests.</p><p><br></p><p>And the time has come. We have come to an ultimate crisis where
decision is possible. Politicians gone, nations are gone.</p><p>Priests gone, there is only one humanity.</p><p><br></p><p>And then every university can become a place, not only to teach you
geography – which is stupid – history – which is just rubbish; but to
teach you something very essential: meditation, love, the art of living,
the art of being human.</p><p><br></p><p>Each university should become a temple of wisdom; it is not yet. It
is called a university but it is not a university, because it is not
universal – just a name. Inside.… I cannot believe it: there are
Catholic universities, Mohammedan universities, Hindu universities! It
seems man has gone mad.</p><p>The universe is not Mohammedan, not Hindu nor Catholic. The
universities should be completely free of all politics, all religions,
but they should teach you the basic arts of being human – which has not
been done up to now. That’s why there are so many atrocities, so many
inhuman acts against human beings.</p><p><br></p><p>What man has done to man is inconceivable. Just Adolf Hitler alone is
responsible for killing at least ten million people. Joseph Stalin is
not far behind. In the twentieth century, are you going to allow all
this to go on?</p><p><br></p><p>No, we are not going to allow it anymore.</p><p><br></p><p>Our ways of changing this world are certainly different. We are not
going to create nuclear weapons to conquer the world and change it,
no.</p><p><br></p><p>We have already the greatest weapon in our hands: meditation. Spread
it far and wide to everyone you love, to everyone you know.</p><p>Don’t tell anybody that it is something to be believed in. Just say,
“I experimented, and it is something not to be missed. You experiment.
There is nothing to lose. If you don’t get anything out of it, you have
not lost anything. And it is such a simple thing that everybody, even a
small child, can start doing it. And it can be done even by the dying
man in the last moment of his life.”</p><p><br></p><p>And if a dying man can do it, can reach his center, he will know that
death is happening only to the house in which he used to live, but he is
not going to die. He will know his eternity, his immortality. And that
knowledge, that wisdom is the greatest richness that one can
achieve.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>I HAVE BEEN A SANNYASIN FOR ELEVEN YEARS. NEVER IN MY LIFE HAVE I
BEEN AS HAPPY AS NOW. BUT WHEN I LISTEN TO YOU LATELY, I FEEL THAT I
HAVE NEVER REALLY GONE INSIDE. IS THIS POSSIBLE?</p><p><br></p><p>Not only possible, it is absolutely certain.</p><p><br></p><p>Just being happy is nothing. It is dangerous too, because somebody
who is unhappy at least tries to find some way to get out of it.</p><p><br></p><p>You have been a sannyasin for eleven years. Naturally – my people are
immensely happy people, and happiness is catching – you are caught by
the happiness of everybody. And there is no reason to be sad here, there
is no reason to be frustrated here, there is no reason to be
disappointed here. But this happiness is not what I call blissfulness.
This happiness is good, but just good is not enough.</p><p><br></p><p>You will have to enter into yourself.</p><p>And remember, in entering into yourself you are not going to lose
your happiness. You are fortunate, because the person who starts from
unhappiness will have to lose unhappiness.</p><p><br></p><p>You are not going to lose anything.</p><p><br></p><p>You will find more and more happiness.</p><p><br></p><p>And you will find the happiness turning, changing into blissfulness,
and finally into enlightenment. You are on the right track, but you are
not moving!</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part30>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

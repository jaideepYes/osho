Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
IS IT POSSIBLE TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ONESELF WITHOUT FIRST LEARNING TO LOVE ONESELF?
It is absolutely impossible to be responsible for yourself unless you learn to love yourself. Every child is born with tremendous love for himself. It is the society that destroys that love, it is the religion that destroys that love – because if a child goes on growing in loving himself, who is going to love Jesus Christ?"><meta name=author content="Osho"><link rel=canonical href=https://osho.lol/posts/from_death_to_deathlessness/part8/><meta name=google-site-verification content="XYZabc"><meta name=yandex-verification content="XYZabc"><meta name=msvalidate.01 content="XYZabc"><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.b609c58d5c11bb90b1a54e04005d74ad1ddf22165eb79f5533967e57df9c3b50.css integrity="sha256-tgnFjVwRu5CxpU4EAF10rR3fIhZet59VM5Z+V9+cO1A=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=mask-icon href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://osho.lol/posts/from_death_to_deathlessness/part8/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:title" content="8 No society rewards lovers"><meta property="og:description" content="< Previous | Contents | Next >

Every child is born with tremendous love for himself. It is the society that destroys that love, it is the religion that destroys that love – because if a child goes on growing in loving himself, who is going to love Jesus Christ? Who is going to love the president, Ronald Reagan? Who is going to love the parents?\nThe child’s love for himself has to be distracted. He has to be conditioned so that his love is always towards an object outside himself. It makes man very poor, because when you love somebody outside of yourself, whether it is God, the pope, the father, the wife, the husband, the children – whoever is the object of your love – it makes you dependent on the object. You become secondary in your own eyes, you become a beggar.\nYou were born an emperor, utterly contented within yourself. But the father wants you to love him, the mother wants you to love her. Everybody around you wants to become an object for your love. Nobody bothers that a man who cannot love himself cannot love anybody else either.\nSo a very mad society is created where everybody is trying to love somebody – and they have nothing to give. Nor has the other person anything to give. Why are lovers continuously fighting,\nnagging, harassing each other? The simple reason is they are not getting what they were thinking to get. Both are beggars, both are empty.\nA rightly brought up child will be allowed to grow in love towards himself so that he becomes so full of love that sharing becomes a necessity. He is so burdened with love that he wants somebody to share it. And then love never makes you dependent on anybody. You are the giver; the giver is never a beggar. And the other is also a giver.\nAnd when two emperors, masters of their own hearts, meet, there is tremendous joy. Nobody is dependent on anybody else; everybody is independent and individual, well-centered in himself, well-grounded in himself. He has roots which go deep down within his being, from where the juice called love comes towards the surface and blossoms in thousands of roses.\nThis type of person has not been possible up to now because of your prophets, your messiahs, your incarnations of God, and all other kinds of idiots. They have destroyed you for their own glory, for their own ego. They have crushed you utterly.\nYou can see the logic. Either the messiah, the savior, becomes the object of your love, and you become just shadows blindly following him; or if you are fully contented, overflowing with love and blossoming in thousands of roses, then who cares to be saved? – you are already saved. Who cares about paradise? – you are in it.\nThe priest will die if you learn how to love yourself, the politician will not have followers; all the vested interests in society will go bankrupt. They are all thriving on a very subtle psychological exploitation of you.\nBut learning to love oneself is not difficult, it is natural. If you have been able to do something which is unnatural, if you have learned how to love others without loving yourself, then the other thing is very simple. You have done the almost impossible. It is only a question of understanding, a simple understanding, that “I am to love myself; otherwise I will miss the meaning of life. I will never grow up, I will simply grow old. I will not have any individuality. I will not be truly human, dignified, integrated.”\nAnd moreover, if you cannot love yourself, you cannot love anybody else in the world. So many psychological problems have arisen because you have been distracted from yourself. You are unworthy, you are not what you should be; your actions have to be corrected. You have to be molded into a certain personality.\nIn Japan they have four-hundred-year-old trees, but their height is only six inches. They think that it is a form of art. It is murder, sheer murder! The tree looks ancient, but is only six inches high. It would have been one hundred feet high, reaching towards the stars. What have they done? What strategy have they used?\nThe same strategy has been used against humanity, human beings. They put the tree in a pot which has no bottom. So whenever the tree grows its roots, they go on cutting them, because there is no bottom to the pot. The roots they go on cutting, and unless roots grow deeper, the tree cannot rise higher. It grows old, but it never grows up. Exactly the same has been done with human beings.\nYour love for yourself is a basic necessity for your growth. Hence, I teach you to be selfish-which is natural.\nAll your religions have been teaching you to be altruistic. Sacrifice yourself for any idiotic idea: the flag – just a rotten piece of cloth. You sacrifice yourself to the nation – which is nothing but fantasy, because the earth is not divided anywhere into nations. It is the politicians’ cunningness, to divide the earth on the map. You are sacrificing for the lines drawn on the maps! Die for your religion: Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism, Mohammedanism. And they have managed it in such a way that the individual is caught.\nIf you die for your nation you will be called a martyr – you are simply committing suicide, and that too for a foolish reason. If you die for your religion you will reach paradise, you will enjoy eternal blessings. They have manipulated you. But one thing is basic in that manipulation, that is, don’t love yourself; hate yourself, because you are not worth anything.\nEverybody is full of hate for himself. And do you think if you hate yourself you can find someone who is going to love you? Even you are not ready to love yourself; it is impossible for anybody else to love you. You have accepted the idea that unless you follow certain rules, religious dogmas, political ideologies, you are not of any worth.\nWhen you were born, you were not born as a Christian, as a Catholic; you were not born as a communist. Every child comes into the world as a tabula rasa, completely clean. Nothing is written on him – the BIBLE, KORAN, GITA, DAS KAPITAL – no, nothing is written on him. He brings no holy book with himself. He comes in utter innocence. But his innocence becomes his greatest trouble, because all around him are wolves – hiding in politicians, in priests, in parents, in teachers. They all jump upon your innocence. They start writing things on you which later on you will believe is your heritage.\nThey have destroyed your heritage. Now it is possible for them to enslave you, to make you do anything they want. If they want you to murder innocent people.…\nThey are doing that right now in South Africa. Fifteen percent of the population, white people, are destroying eighty-five percent, black people. The country belongs to the black people; all its gold mines, diamond mines, belong to the black people. These fifteen percent white people are just invaders, thieves. But do you know? – those eighty-five percent of the people have no voting rights. The land is theirs, the gold mines are theirs, but they are the poorest on the earth. They only work as slaves and servants. It is not only South Africa, it is all over the earth.\nThere are religious mafias, there are political mafias, and they go on exploiting you. They may be enemies to each other, but on one point they all agree: that a man should not be allowed to love himself. That cuts his roots from his own being, and then he is helpless, rootless, just a driftwood, so whatever you want to make of him you can.\nThe people of this country were killing innocent, poor people in Vietnam. What business was it of theirs? And it was not one-sided. You were sending your own, who have not tasted anything of life, to kill and to be killed in the name of democracy, in the name of America. But why should one sacrifice oneself in any name? Mohammedans and Christians have been fighting, killing each other,\nin the name of God. Both are fighting and killing in the same name – God. A strange world we have created!\nBut the strategy is very simple: destroy the person’s natural love for himself. Then he is so unworthy in his own eyes, he is ready to do anything for a gold medal, just to feel a little worth – that he is also somebody. Do you see on your generals many colored stripes? What kind of stupidity is this? Those stripes go on growing as the general goes on killing himself, destroying himself.\nYou can have all those colors on your shirts. I don’t think there is any law that can prevent it, but you will look simply foolish. Those generals, they don’t look foolish, they are respected; they are great heroes. And what have they done? They have murdered many people of your country, they have murdered many people of other countries. These murderers are rewarded.\nHave you seen any society rewarding its lovers? No, lovers are to be condemned. No society allows lovers any respect; love is an anathema to society.\nSo the first thing all these vested interests have to do is distract you from love – and they have succeeded up to now.\nMillions of years... and man has remained a slave, feeling a deep inferiority complex in himself, unworthiness, because he is not able to fulfill all that is required of him. In fact, whatever is required is so unnatural that there is no way to fulfill it. And on your worthlessness the messiahs go on becoming bigger and bigger, because they say, they promise that they are the saviors; they are going to save you. You cannot save yourself. They never allowed you to learn swimming. On your own you can only be drowned.\nThe politicians go on giving you hope that soon there will be no poverty – and poverty goes on growing. It is not decreasing, it is increasing. The politicians go on saying that soon you will have a classless society. In Soviet Russia they have managed to create forcibly, against all human values, a classless society. But the people who had promised the classless society had promised that there would be no poor, no poverty. What has actually happened is that nobody is rich in Russia, all are equally poor. Great equality!\nAnd the hypocrisy that the society is classless has to be understood. Yes, old class differences have disappeared because the rich are no longer there, so you cannot divide the society into the bourgeois and the proletariat. But a new class has come up: those who have power – the communist bureaucracy – and those who have no power. Just the names have changed.\nNow, as a member of the communist party you have special powers – just the same way that in other countries rich people have special powers, and there is the rest of the country, powerless. This is not a classless society; new classes have replaced the old classes.\nIn Ethiopia thousands of people are dying every day. And you will be surprised, in America there are half a million people who are suffering from overeating, obesity; they go on becoming fatter and fatter. In Ethiopia people are shrinking, starving and dying. In America people are dying from overeating, in Ethiopia they are dying because they have nothing to eat.\nDo you think this world that we have created is sane?\nHalf of India is going to face the same fate as Ethiopia soon – and India’s government is selling wheat, exporting wheat to the outside world. Their own people are going to die – not in small numbers: fifty percent of India is just on the borderline. Any moment it can become a bigger Ethiopia. But the political leaders are selling the wheat to other countries because they want nuclear plants, atomic energy, so they can also compete in the foolish race that is going on.\nAnybody can see that it will take at least three hundred years for India to be a nuclear power equal to America or the Soviet Union. And do you think for these three hundred years America and the Soviet Union will simply wait? They will be growing in the same direction of destruction and death.\nAll this has happened in the name of altruism.\nI want you to become absolutely selfish. Love yourself, be yourself. Don’t be distracted by any type of people – religious, political, social, educational. Your first responsibility is neither towards religion nor towards nation. Your first responsibility is towards yourself.\nAnd just see: if everybody is loving himself, caring about himself, his intelligence will come to its peak, his love will be overflowing. To me, the philosophy of selfishness will make him really altruistic because he will have so much to share, so much to give, that giving will become a joy to him, that sharing will be a celebration to him.\nAltruism can only be a by-product of self-love.\nBecause you don’t love yourself, you feel weak – because love is nourishment, it is your strength. Naturally, how can you feel responsible? You go on throwing your responsibility on somebody else’s shoulders. God is responsible, fate is responsible, Adam and Eve are responsible. The serpent who seduced Eve to disobey God – that serpent is responsible.\nCan you see the idiocy of all this dumping your responsibility on somebody? – a serpent, perhaps millions of years ago.… I have tried hard to make some little conversation with a serpent, with a snake – they don’t speak. In fact, they don’t even hear. I discovered that serpents don’t have ears, ears are not part of their physiology. And if they cannot hear, how can they speak? And how could they persuade Eve?\nBut we have to dump our responsibility on somebody else. Adam dumps it on Eve. Eve dumps it on the serpent. The serpent – if he could speak – would dump it on God. This way we go on throwing our responsibility, without understanding that unless your are responsible for yourself you are not truly an individual.\nShirking responsibility is destructive to your individuality. But you can accept responsibility only when you have tremendous love for yourself.\nI accept my responsibility, and I rejoice in it. I have never dumped my responsibility on anybody else, because that is losing freedom, that is becoming enslaved, at the mercy of others. Whatsoever I am, I am wholly and solely responsible for it. This gives me a great strength. It gives me roots, centering. But the source of this responsibility is, I love myself.\nI have also been through the same type of mass exploitation. But from the very beginning I made it clear that if I am going to be pushed into heaven I will refuse it. Of my own will I am ready to go to hell. At least I will have my independence, my choice.\nMy parents, my teachers, my professors struggled with me. But I said, “One thing is certain: I cannot accept any bribery to become a slave. I would rather suffer for the whole eternity in hellfire, but I will remain myself. At least that much joy I will have – that this is my choice, nobody has forced me.”\nTaken as a prisoner into paradise, do you think you can enjoy it? Going into paradise following Jesus Christ, or Moses, or Buddha, or Krishna – what kind of paradise will that be, where you are expected to be blind believers; you cannot ask a question, you cannot inquire about anything. That paradise will be worse than hell.\nBut people have been distracted from their very source.\nI want you to come back home. Respect yourself. Feel the joy and the pride that existence needs you; otherwise you would not have been here. Rejoice that existence cannot be without you. In the first place that’s why you are here: existence has given you an opportunity, a life with tremendous treasures hidden within you – of beauty, of ecstasy, of freedom.\nBut you are not existential! You are Christian, you are Buddhist, you are Hindu. And I want you only to believe in one thing: existence. There is no need to go to any synagogue or any church. If you cannot experience the sky, the stars, the sunset, the sunrise, the flowers blossoming, the birds singing.… The whole of existence is a sermon! Not prepared by some stupid priest – it is all over the place.\nYou just need to trust yourself; that is another name for loving yourself. And when you trust and love yourself, obviously you have taken all the responsibility of whatever you are, whoever you are, upon your own shoulders. That gives such a tremendous experience of being that nobody can enslave you again.\nMy sannyasins are not my followers – that would be very disrespectful towards you. And to be disrespectful towards the people who love him is the ugliest act anybody can do.\nI want to be just a fellow traveler with you. I am not your leader, I am not your savior. I don’t take any responsibility on myself, and I don’t want you to dump your responsibility on anybody.\nCan you see the beauty of an individual who is capable of standing on his own feet? And whatever happens – joy or sorrow, life or death – the man who has loved himself is so integrated that he will be able not only to enjoy life, he will be able to enjoy death too.\nSocrates was punished by his society. People like Socrates are bound to be punished, because they are individuals and they don’t allow anybody to dominate them. He was given poison. He was lying in the bed and the man who was going to give him poison was preparing it. The sun was setting – that was the right time. The court had given the exact time, but the man was delaying in preparing the poison. Socrates asked the man, “Time is passing, the sun is setting – what is the delay?”\nThe man could not believe that somebody who is going to die is so particular about the right time for his own death. In fact, he should be thankful for the delay. The man loved Socrates. He had heard him in the court and seen the beauty of the person: he alone had more intelligence than the whole of Athens. He wanted to delay a little more so Socrates could live a little more. But Socrates would not allow him. He said, “Don’t be lazy. Just bring the poison.”\nThe man giving poison to Socrates asked him, “Why are you so excited? I see such radiance on your face, I see such enquiry in your eyes. Don’t you understand? – you are going to DIE.”\nSocrates said, “That’s what I want to know. Life, I have known. It was beautiful; with all its anxieties, anguishes, still it was a joy. Just to breathe is joy enough. I have lived, I have loved; I have done whatever I wanted to do, I have said whatever I wanted to say. Now I want to taste death – and the sooner the better.\n“There are only two possibilities: either my soul will go on living in other forms as the Eastern mystics say – that is a great excitement, to go on that journey of the soul free from the burden of the body. The body is a cage, it has limitations. Or perhaps the materialists are right, that when your body dies everything dies. Nobody remains afterwards. That too, is a great excitement – not to be!\n“I know what it means to be, and the moment has come to know what it means not to be. And when I am no more, what is the problem? Why should I be worried about it? I will not be there to worry, so why waste time now?”\nThis is the man who loves himself. Even the responsibility of death he has chosen – because the court had nothing against him; it was just public prejudice, the prejudice of the mediocre people who could not understand the great flights of intelligence of Socrates. But they were in the majority, and they all decided on death for Socrates.\nThey could not answer a single argument proposed by him. I think they could not even understand what he was saying – answering was out of the question. And he destroyed all their arguments; still, it was a city democracy – the people decided that this man is dangerous, he should be given poison.\nWhat was his fault? His fault was that “He makes our youth rebellious, he makes our youth skeptical, he makes our youth strange. He creates a gap between the older generation and the younger generation. They don’t listen to us anymore, they argue about everything – and it is because of this man.”\nBut the judges were a little better than the common people. They said to Socrates, “We give you a few alternatives. If you leave Athens and promise never to come back again, you can save yourself from death. Or, if you want to remain in Athens, then stop speaking, go into silence. Then too we can persuade the people to let you live. Otherwise, the third alternative is: tomorrow as the sun sets you will have to drink poison.”\nWhat did Socrates do? He said, “I am ready to take the poison tomorrow or today, whenever the poison is ready, but I cannot stop saying the truth. If I am alive I will go on saying it till my last breath. And I cannot leave Athens just to save myself, because then I will feel always a weakling who became afraid of death, who escaped death, who could not take the responsibility of death also. I have lived according to my own thinking, feeling, being; I want to die that way also.\n“And don’t feel guilty. Nobody is responsible for my death, I am responsible. I knew that it was going to happen, because to talk about truth in a society which lives on lies, deceptions, illusions, is to ask for death. Don’t blame these poor people who have decided for my death. If anybody is responsible, I am. And I want you all to know that I lived on my responsibility, and I am dying on my responsibility.\n“Living, I was an individual. Dying, I am an individual. Nobody decides for me; I am decisive about myself.”\nThis is dignity. This is integrity. This is what a human being should be. And if the whole earth is full of people like this man, we can make this earth so beautiful, so ecstatic, so abundant in everything.…\nBut the individual is missing, so you have to take responsibility for yourself. But you will be able to take it only if you start loving whatever you are: this is the way existence wanted you to be. If existence wanted another Jesus Christ, it would have created one. To be Christian is ugly, to be Mohammedan is ugly, to be Hindu is ugly.\nBe yourself, just yourself, simply yourself. And remember, you are taking a great risk when you declare that you are simply yourself. You don’t belong to any crowd, any herd. These are all herds: Hindus, Mohammedans, Christians, communists. You are declaring yourself an individual, knowing perfectly well that it is risky. The crowd may not forgive you at all. But it is so beautiful to take the risk, to move on the razor’s edge where every step is dangerous.\nThe more dangerously you live, the more you live. And it is possible to live, in a single moment, the whole eternity, if you are ready to live with totality, risking all and everything.\nI don’t want you to be a businessman, I want you to be a gambler. And when you are gambling, put everything at stake. Don’t save anything for the next moment. Then whatever happens will bring great blessing to you. Even if you become a beggar, your being will be far more dignified than that of an emperor.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nI HAVE A FEELING THAT YOU ALREADY HAVE TWO HUNDRED ENLIGHTENED PEOPLE. IS THIS TRUE?\nIt is true, but please keep it a secret! Question 3\nBELOVED OSHO,\nTO BREAK OUR HABITUAL WAYS OF ACTING, FEELING AND THINKING, AND TO START WITNESSING INSTEAD, SOME EFFORT SEEMS TO BE REQUIRED. BUT ULTIMATELY ALL EFFORT, INCLUDING THE EFFORT TOWARDS ENLIGHTENMENT, HAS TO BE DROPPED. CAN YOU PLEASE SPEAK ON EFFORT AND NON-EFFORT, AND HOW THEY RELATE TO WITNESSING?\nDon’t be bothered about the future. You have not started making an effort, and you are worried that ultimately you will have to drop making an effort also. Just start – make every effort.\nI can only say one thing to you: when you have made every effort – and all the efforts will fail, as far as the ultimate experience of enlightenment is concerned – when all the efforts fail, you are not required to make no-effort. When all the efforts fail, there is no-effort. You have done everything that was possible, humanly possible, and everything has failed.\nAnd everything fails as far as enlightenment is concerned. It is not your doing. But when everything fails, and you have not been miserly in making efforts, you were total – what remains? A great silence. That is the no-effort. You don’t have to do it. If you do it, it again becomes an effort. It is a non-doing that comes of its own accord; you cannot bring it.\nBut before it can happen, you will have to risk everything, make every effort possible. When you are finished with making efforts, a great silence descends, a great relaxation comes over you. That is the moment of no-effort, and in that very moment you find the light you have been seeking for many lives.\nSo please don’t be worried about no-effort. Just take care of all the efforts possible. Leave no-effort to existence itself! When you have done everything, suddenly existence becomes so compassionate towards you that flowers start showering on you. With your effort you were not able even to get a single flower. And with no-effort you suddenly find flowers are raining all over you.\nAnd that’s why it can be said, enlightenment is not an achievement. you don’t become enlightened. When you are not, enlightenment happens. The moment your efforts fail, you fail.\nAnd this is the mystery of religious experience: in your utter failure is your ultimate success.

TO LOVE ONESELF?</p><p><br></p><p>It is absolutely impossible to be responsible for yourself unless you
learn to love yourself. Every child is born with tremendous love for
himself. It is the society that destroys that love, it is the religion
that destroys that love – because if a child goes on growing in loving
himself, who is going to love Jesus Christ? Who is going to love the
president, Ronald Reagan? Who is going to love the parents?</p><p><br></p><p>The child’s love for himself has to be distracted. He has to be
conditioned so that his love is always towards an object outside
himself. It makes man very poor, because when you love somebody outside
of yourself, whether it is God, the pope, the father, the wife, the
husband, the children – whoever is the object of your love – it makes
you dependent on the object. You become secondary in your own eyes, you
become a beggar.</p><p><br></p><p>You were born an emperor, utterly contented within yourself. But the
father wants you to love him, the mother wants you to love her.
Everybody around you wants to become an object for your love. Nobody
bothers that a man who cannot love himself cannot love anybody else
either.</p><p><br></p><p>So a very mad society is created where everybody is trying to love
somebody – and they have nothing to give. Nor has the other person
anything to give. Why are lovers continuously fighting,</p><p>nagging, harassing each other? The simple reason is they are not
getting what they were thinking to get. Both are beggars, both are
empty.</p><p><br></p><p>A rightly brought up child will be allowed to grow in love towards
himself so that he becomes so full of love that sharing becomes a
necessity. He is so burdened with love that he wants somebody to share
it. And then love never makes you dependent on anybody. You are the
giver; the giver is never a beggar. And the other is also a giver.</p><p><br></p><p>And when two emperors, masters of their own hearts, meet, there is
tremendous joy. Nobody is dependent on anybody else; everybody is
independent and individual, well-centered in himself, well-grounded in
himself. He has roots which go deep down within his being, from where
the juice called love comes towards the surface and blossoms in
thousands of roses.</p><p><br></p><p>This type of person has not been possible up to now because of your
prophets, your messiahs, your incarnations of God, and all other kinds
of idiots. They have destroyed you for their own glory, for their own
ego. They have crushed you utterly.</p><p><br></p><p>You can see the logic. Either the messiah, the savior, becomes the
object of your love, and you become just shadows blindly following him;
or if you are fully contented, overflowing with love and blossoming in
thousands of roses, then who cares to be saved? – you are already saved.
Who cares about paradise? – you are in it.</p><p><br></p><p>The priest will die if you learn how to love yourself, the politician
will not have followers; all the vested interests in society will go
bankrupt. They are all thriving on a very subtle psychological
exploitation of you.</p><p><br></p><p>But learning to love oneself is not difficult, it is natural. If you
have been able to do something which is unnatural, if you have learned
how to love others without loving yourself, then the other thing is very
simple. You have done the almost impossible. It is only a question of
understanding, a simple understanding, that “I am to love myself;
otherwise I will miss the meaning of life. I will never grow up, I will
simply grow old. I will not have any individuality. I will not be truly
human, dignified, integrated.”</p><p><br></p><p>And moreover, if you cannot love yourself, you cannot love anybody
else in the world. So many psychological problems have arisen because
you have been distracted from yourself. You are unworthy, you are not
what you should be; your actions have to be corrected. You have to be
molded into a certain personality.</p><p><br></p><p>In Japan they have four-hundred-year-old trees, but their height is
only six inches. They think that it is a form of art. It is murder,
sheer murder! The tree looks ancient, but is only six inches high. It
would have been one hundred feet high, reaching towards the stars. What
have they done? What strategy have they used?</p><p><br></p><p>The same strategy has been used against humanity, human beings. They
put the tree in a pot which has no bottom. So whenever the tree grows
its roots, they go on cutting them, because there is no bottom to the
pot. The roots they go on cutting, and unless roots grow deeper, the
tree cannot rise higher. It grows old, but it never grows up. Exactly
the same has been done with human beings.</p><p>Your love for yourself is a basic necessity for your growth. Hence, I
teach you to be selfish-which is natural.</p><p><br></p><p>All your religions have been teaching you to be altruistic. Sacrifice
yourself for any idiotic idea: the flag – just a rotten piece of cloth.
You sacrifice yourself to the nation – which is nothing but fantasy,
because the earth is not divided anywhere into nations. It is the
politicians’ cunningness, to divide the earth on the map. You are
sacrificing for the lines drawn on the maps! Die for your religion:
Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism, Mohammedanism. And they have managed
it in such a way that the individual is caught.</p><p><br></p><p>If you die for your nation you will be called a martyr – you are
simply committing suicide, and that too for a foolish reason. If you die
for your religion you will reach paradise, you will enjoy eternal
blessings. They have manipulated you. But one thing is basic in that
manipulation, that is, don’t love yourself; hate yourself, because you
are not worth anything.</p><p><br></p><p>Everybody is full of hate for himself. And do you think if you hate
yourself you can find someone who is going to love you? Even you are not
ready to love yourself; it is impossible for anybody else to love you.
You have accepted the idea that unless you follow certain rules,
religious dogmas, political ideologies, you are not of any worth.</p><p><br></p><p>When you were born, you were not born as a Christian, as a Catholic;
you were not born as a communist. Every child comes into the world as a
tabula rasa, completely clean. Nothing is written on him – the BIBLE,
KORAN, GITA, DAS KAPITAL – no, nothing is written on him. He brings no
holy book with himself. He comes in utter innocence. But his innocence
becomes his greatest trouble, because all around him are wolves – hiding
in politicians, in priests, in parents, in teachers. They all jump upon
your innocence. They start writing things on you which later on you will
believe is your heritage.</p><p><br></p><p>They have destroyed your heritage. Now it is possible for them to
enslave you, to make you do anything they want. If they want you to
murder innocent people.…</p><p><br></p><p>They are doing that right now in South Africa. Fifteen percent of the
population, white people, are destroying eighty-five percent, black
people. The country belongs to the black people; all its gold mines,
diamond mines, belong to the black people. These fifteen percent white
people are just invaders, thieves. But do you know? – those eighty-five
percent of the people have no voting rights. The land is theirs, the
gold mines are theirs, but they are the poorest on the earth. They only
work as slaves and servants. It is not only South Africa, it is all over
the earth.</p><p><br></p><p>There are religious mafias, there are political mafias, and they go
on exploiting you. They may be enemies to each other, but on one point
they all agree: that a man should not be allowed to love himself. That
cuts his roots from his own being, and then he is helpless, rootless,
just a driftwood, so whatever you want to make of him you can.</p><p><br></p><p>The people of this country were killing innocent, poor people in
Vietnam. What business was it of theirs? And it was not one-sided. You
were sending your own, who have not tasted anything of life, to kill and
to be killed in the name of democracy, in the name of America. But why
should one sacrifice oneself in any name? Mohammedans and Christians
have been fighting, killing each other,</p><p>in the name of God. Both are fighting and killing in the same name –
God. A strange world we have created!</p><p><br></p><p>But the strategy is very simple: destroy the person’s natural love
for himself. Then he is so unworthy in his own eyes, he is ready to do
anything for a gold medal, just to feel a little worth – that he is also
somebody. Do you see on your generals many colored stripes? What kind of
stupidity is this? Those stripes go on growing as the general goes on
killing himself, destroying himself.</p><p><br></p><p>You can have all those colors on your shirts. I don’t think there is
any law that can prevent it, but you will look simply foolish. Those
generals, they don’t look foolish, they are respected; they are great
heroes. And what have they done? They have murdered many people of your
country, they have murdered many people of other countries. These
murderers are rewarded.</p><p><br></p><p>Have you seen any society rewarding its lovers? No, lovers are to be
condemned. No society allows lovers any respect; love is an anathema to
society.</p><p><br></p><p>So the first thing all these vested interests have to do is distract
you from love – and they have succeeded up to now.</p><p><br></p><p>Millions of years... and man has remained a slave, feeling a deep
inferiority complex in himself, unworthiness, because he is not able to
fulfill all that is required of him. In fact, whatever is required is so
unnatural that there is no way to fulfill it. And on your worthlessness
the messiahs go on becoming bigger and bigger, because they say, they
promise that they are the saviors; they are going to save you. You
cannot save yourself. They never allowed you to learn swimming. On your
own you can only be drowned.</p><p><br></p><p>The politicians go on giving you hope that soon there will be no
poverty – and poverty goes on growing. It is not decreasing, it is
increasing. The politicians go on saying that soon you will have a
classless society. In Soviet Russia they have managed to create
forcibly, against all human values, a classless society. But the people
who had promised the classless society had promised that there would be
no poor, no poverty. What has actually happened is that nobody is rich
in Russia, all are equally poor. Great equality!</p><p><br></p><p>And the hypocrisy that the society is classless has to be understood.
Yes, old class differences have disappeared because the rich are no
longer there, so you cannot divide the society into the bourgeois and
the proletariat. But a new class has come up: those who have power – the
communist bureaucracy – and those who have no power. Just the names have
changed.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, as a member of the communist party you have special powers –
just the same way that in other countries rich people have special
powers, and there is the rest of the country, powerless. This is not a
classless society; new classes have replaced the old classes.</p><p><br></p><p>In Ethiopia thousands of people are dying every day. And you will be
surprised, in America there are half a million people who are suffering
from overeating, obesity; they go on becoming fatter and fatter. In
Ethiopia people are shrinking, starving and dying. In America people are
dying from overeating, in Ethiopia they are dying because they have
nothing to eat.</p><p><br></p><p>Do you think this world that we have created is sane?</p><p>Half of India is going to face the same fate as Ethiopia soon – and
India’s government is selling wheat, exporting wheat to the outside
world. Their own people are going to die – not in small numbers: fifty
percent of India is just on the borderline. Any moment it can become a
bigger Ethiopia. But the political leaders are selling the wheat to
other countries because they want nuclear plants, atomic energy, so they
can also compete in the foolish race that is going on.</p><p><br></p><p>Anybody can see that it will take at least three hundred years for
India to be a nuclear power equal to America or the Soviet Union. And do
you think for these three hundred years America and the Soviet Union
will simply wait? They will be growing in the same direction of
destruction and death.</p><p><br></p><p>All this has happened in the name of altruism.</p><p><br></p><p>I want you to become absolutely selfish. Love yourself, be yourself.
Don’t be distracted by any type of people – religious, political,
social, educational. Your first responsibility is neither towards
religion nor towards nation. Your first responsibility is towards
yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>And just see: if everybody is loving himself, caring about himself,
his intelligence will come to its peak, his love will be overflowing. To
me, the philosophy of selfishness will make him really altruistic
because he will have so much to share, so much to give, that giving will
become a joy to him, that sharing will be a celebration to him.</p><p><br></p><p>Altruism can only be a by-product of self-love.</p><p><br></p><p>Because you don’t love yourself, you feel weak – because love is
nourishment, it is your strength. Naturally, how can you feel
responsible? You go on throwing your responsibility on somebody else’s
shoulders. God is responsible, fate is responsible, Adam and Eve are
responsible. The serpent who seduced Eve to disobey God – that serpent
is responsible.</p><p><br></p><p>Can you see the idiocy of all this dumping your responsibility on
somebody? – a serpent, perhaps millions of years ago.… I have tried hard
to make some little conversation with a serpent, with a snake – they
don’t speak. In fact, they don’t even hear. I discovered that serpents
don’t have ears, ears are not part of their physiology. And if they
cannot hear, how can they speak? And how could they persuade Eve?</p><p><br></p><p>But we have to dump our responsibility on somebody else. Adam dumps
it on Eve. Eve dumps it on the serpent. The serpent – if he could speak
– would dump it on God. This way we go on throwing our responsibility,
without understanding that unless your are responsible for yourself you
are not truly an individual.</p><p><br></p><p>Shirking responsibility is destructive to your individuality. But you
can accept responsibility only when you have tremendous love for
yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>I accept my responsibility, and I rejoice in it. I have never dumped
my responsibility on anybody else, because that is losing freedom, that
is becoming enslaved, at the mercy of others. Whatsoever I am, I am
wholly and solely responsible for it. This gives me a great strength. It
gives me roots, centering. But the source of this responsibility is, I
love myself.</p><p>I have also been through the same type of mass exploitation. But from
the very beginning I made it clear that if I am going to be pushed into
heaven I will refuse it. Of my own will I am ready to go to hell. At
least I will have my independence, my choice.</p><p><br></p><p>My parents, my teachers, my professors struggled with me. But I said,
“One thing is certain: I cannot accept any bribery to become a slave. I
would rather suffer for the whole eternity in hellfire, but I will
remain myself. At least that much joy I will have – that this is my
choice, nobody has forced me.”</p><p><br></p><p>Taken as a prisoner into paradise, do you think you can enjoy it?
Going into paradise following Jesus Christ, or Moses, or Buddha, or
Krishna – what kind of paradise will that be, where you are expected to
be blind believers; you cannot ask a question, you cannot inquire about
anything. That paradise will be worse than hell.</p><p><br></p><p>But people have been distracted from their very source.</p><p><br></p><p>I want you to come back home. Respect yourself. Feel the joy and the
pride that existence needs you; otherwise you would not have been here.
Rejoice that existence cannot be without you. In the first place that’s
why you are here: existence has given you an opportunity, a life with
tremendous treasures hidden within you – of beauty, of ecstasy, of
freedom.</p><p><br></p><p>But you are not existential! You are Christian, you are Buddhist, you
are Hindu. And I want you only to believe in one thing: existence. There
is no need to go to any synagogue or any church. If you cannot
experience the sky, the stars, the sunset, the sunrise, the flowers
blossoming, the birds singing.… The whole of existence is a sermon! Not
prepared by some stupid priest – it is all over the place.</p><p><br></p><p>You just need to trust yourself; that is another name for loving
yourself. And when you trust and love yourself, obviously you have taken
all the responsibility of whatever you are, whoever you are, upon your
own shoulders. That gives such a tremendous experience of being that
nobody can enslave you again.</p><p><br></p><p>My sannyasins are not my followers – that would be very disrespectful
towards you. And to be disrespectful towards the people who love him is
the ugliest act anybody can do.</p><p><br></p><p>I want to be just a fellow traveler with you. I am not your leader, I
am not your savior. I don’t take any responsibility on myself, and I
don’t want you to dump your responsibility on anybody.</p><p><br></p><p>Can you see the beauty of an individual who is capable of standing on
his own feet? And whatever happens – joy or sorrow, life or death – the
man who has loved himself is so integrated that he will be able not only
to enjoy life, he will be able to enjoy death too.</p><p><br></p><p>Socrates was punished by his society. People like Socrates are bound
to be punished, because they are individuals and they don’t allow
anybody to dominate them. He was given poison. He was lying in the bed
and the man who was going to give him poison was preparing it. The sun
was setting – that was the right time. The court had given the exact
time, but the man was delaying in preparing the poison. Socrates asked
the man, “Time is passing, the sun is setting – what is the delay?”</p><p>The man could not believe that somebody who is going to die is so
particular about the right time for his own death. In fact, he should be
thankful for the delay. The man loved Socrates. He had heard him in the
court and seen the beauty of the person: he alone had more intelligence
than the whole of Athens. He wanted to delay a little more so Socrates
could live a little more. But Socrates would not allow him. He said,
“Don’t be lazy. Just bring the poison.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man giving poison to Socrates asked him, “Why are you so excited?
I see such radiance on your face, I see such enquiry in your eyes. Don’t
you understand? – you are going to DIE.”</p><p><br></p><p>Socrates said, “That’s what I want to know. Life, I have known. It
was beautiful; with all its anxieties, anguishes, still it was a joy.
Just to breathe is joy enough. I have lived, I have loved; I have done
whatever I wanted to do, I have said whatever I wanted to say. Now I
want to taste death – and the sooner the better.</p><p><br></p><p>“There are only two possibilities: either my soul will go on living
in other forms as the Eastern mystics say – that is a great excitement,
to go on that journey of the soul free from the burden of the body. The
body is a cage, it has limitations. Or perhaps the materialists are
right, that when your body dies everything dies. Nobody remains
afterwards. That too, is a great excitement – not to be!</p><p><br></p><p>“I know what it means to be, and the moment has come to know what it
means not to be. And when I am no more, what is the problem? Why should
I be worried about it? I will not be there to worry, so why waste time
now?”</p><p><br></p><p>This is the man who loves himself. Even the responsibility of death
he has chosen – because the court had nothing against him; it was just
public prejudice, the prejudice of the mediocre people who could not
understand the great flights of intelligence of Socrates. But they were
in the majority, and they all decided on death for Socrates.</p><p><br></p><p>They could not answer a single argument proposed by him. I think they
could not even understand what he was saying – answering was out of the
question. And he destroyed all their arguments; still, it was a city
democracy – the people decided that this man is dangerous, he should be
given poison.</p><p><br></p><p>What was his fault? His fault was that “He makes our youth
rebellious, he makes our youth skeptical, he makes our youth strange. He
creates a gap between the older generation and the younger generation.
They don’t listen to us anymore, they argue about everything – and it is
because of this man.”</p><p><br></p><p>But the judges were a little better than the common people. They said
to Socrates, “We give you a few alternatives. If you leave Athens and
promise never to come back again, you can save yourself from death. Or,
if you want to remain in Athens, then stop speaking, go into silence.
Then too we can persuade the people to let you live. Otherwise, the
third alternative is: tomorrow as the sun sets you will have to drink
poison.”</p><p><br></p><p>What did Socrates do? He said, “I am ready to take the poison
tomorrow or today, whenever the poison is ready, but I cannot stop
saying the truth. If I am alive I will go on saying it till my last
breath. And I cannot leave Athens just to save myself, because then I
will feel always a weakling who became afraid of death, who escaped
death, who could not take the responsibility of death also. I have lived
according to my own thinking, feeling, being; I want to die that way
also.</p><p>“And don’t feel guilty. Nobody is responsible for my death, I am
responsible. I knew that it was going to happen, because to talk about
truth in a society which lives on lies, deceptions, illusions, is to ask
for death. Don’t blame these poor people who have decided for my death.
If anybody is responsible, I am. And I want you all to know that I lived
on my responsibility, and I am dying on my responsibility.</p><p><br></p><p>“Living, I was an individual. Dying, I am an individual. Nobody
decides for me; I am decisive about myself.”</p><p><br></p><p>This is dignity. This is integrity. This is what a human being should
be. And if the whole earth is full of people like this man, we can make
this earth so beautiful, so ecstatic, so abundant in everything.…</p><p><br></p><p>But the individual is missing, so you have to take responsibility for
yourself. But you will be able to take it only if you start loving
whatever you are: this is the way existence wanted you to be. If
existence wanted another Jesus Christ, it would have created one. To be
Christian is ugly, to be Mohammedan is ugly, to be Hindu is ugly.</p><p><br></p><p>Be yourself, just yourself, simply yourself. And remember, you are
taking a great risk when you declare that you are simply yourself. You
don’t belong to any crowd, any herd. These are all herds: Hindus,
Mohammedans, Christians, communists. You are declaring yourself an
individual, knowing perfectly well that it is risky. The crowd may not
forgive you at all. But it is so beautiful to take the risk, to move on
the razor’s edge where every step is dangerous.</p><p><br></p><p>The more dangerously you live, the more you live. And it is possible
to live, in a single moment, the whole eternity, if you are ready to
live with totality, risking all and everything.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t want you to be a businessman, I want you to be a gambler. And
when you are gambling, put everything at stake. Don’t save anything for
the next moment. Then whatever happens will bring great blessing to you.
Even if you become a beggar, your being will be far more dignified than
that of an emperor.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>I HAVE A FEELING THAT YOU ALREADY HAVE TWO HUNDRED ENLIGHTENED
PEOPLE. IS THIS TRUE?</p><p><br></p><p>It is true, but please keep it a secret! Question 3</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>TO BREAK OUR HABITUAL WAYS OF ACTING, FEELING AND THINKING, AND TO
START WITNESSING INSTEAD, SOME EFFORT SEEMS TO BE REQUIRED. BUT
ULTIMATELY ALL EFFORT, INCLUDING THE EFFORT TOWARDS ENLIGHTENMENT, HAS
TO BE DROPPED. CAN YOU PLEASE SPEAK ON EFFORT AND NON-EFFORT, AND HOW
THEY RELATE TO WITNESSING?</p><p>Don’t be bothered about the future. You have not started making an
effort, and you are worried that ultimately you will have to drop making
an effort also. Just start – make every effort.</p><p><br></p><p>I can only say one thing to you: when you have made every effort –
and all the efforts will fail, as far as the ultimate experience of
enlightenment is concerned – when all the efforts fail, you are not
required to make no-effort. When all the efforts fail, there is
no-effort. You have done everything that was possible, humanly possible,
and everything has failed.</p><p><br></p><p>And everything fails as far as enlightenment is concerned. It is not
your doing. But when everything fails, and you have not been miserly in
making efforts, you were total – what remains? A great silence. That is
the no-effort. You don’t have to do it. If you do it, it again becomes
an effort. It is a non-doing that comes of its own accord; you cannot
bring it.</p><p><br></p><p>But before it can happen, you will have to risk everything, make
every effort possible. When you are finished with making efforts, a
great silence descends, a great relaxation comes over you. That is the
moment of no-effort, and in that very moment you find the light you have
been seeking for many lives.</p><p><br></p><p>So please don’t be worried about no-effort. Just take care of all the
efforts possible. Leave no-effort to existence itself! When you have
done everything, suddenly existence becomes so compassionate towards you
that flowers start showering on you. With your effort you were not able
even to get a single flower. And with no-effort you suddenly find
flowers are raining all over you.</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s why it can be said, enlightenment is not an achievement.
you don’t become enlightened. When you are not, enlightenment happens.
The moment your efforts fail, you fail.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is the mystery of religious experience: in your utter
failure is your ultimate success. When you are not, for the first time,
you are.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part7>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

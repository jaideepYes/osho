OUR SERIOUSNESS SEEMS TO CREATE MORE DISEASE AND PARANOIA. INSTEAD OF FEELING LIKE VICTIMS, HOW CAN WE RESPOND THROUGH CELEBRATION?\nDeath is always there. You may be unaware of it, but it is always confronting you with immediacy. You cannot be certain of the next moment.\nBut we go on living – and nobody believes that he is going to die; it is always the other who dies. You have seen people dying, many people of all kinds – children, young people, old people – but you have never seen yourself dying. So obviously somewhere in your mind the idea persists that it is always the other who dies. But remember, those who are dead also had the same idea; for them you are the other. And one day you will be dying, and the people who will take you to the graveyard will not feel at all the immediacy of death.\nIt is always there – just like a shadow to you. From the very first moment of your birth you have been dying. It is a fallacy to think that death comes like an accident, suddenly when you are seventy, eighty, ninety. No. Death and life are together. The moment you are born you start dying.\nBut man is very clever in deceiving himself.\nEach of your birthdays is an effort to forget that it is not your birthday, it is your death day; you have died one year more. But with flowers and candles and cakes, one forgets the immediacy of death. It is always with you.\nBirth is the beginning of death.\nSo AIDS in fact should not make you serious; on the contrary it should make you more alert, more aware, because you are a rare person for whom death is a certainty, and you cannot deceive yourself anymore.\nMany who do not have AIDS will be dying before you, but their death will be coming without their knowing. And to know is always better than not to know. Something can be done when you know a fact is going to happen.\nThe AIDS patient knows that within two years he is going to die. This immediacy of death should wake you up. Now there is no more time for you to fool around, no time for you to deceive yourself. Death is just there waiting for you, and you are fortunate that you know it.\nKnowing of your death can become a transformation.\nIf you know you are going to die within two years, these two years can be devoted to meditation. Otherwise people are always postponing; they will meditate tomorrow – and tomorrow never comes. And there are so many other things to do, you don’t have time for meditation.\nBut a man who is fully aware that now there is no way, that tomorrow is finished, all that you have in your hands is this moment.This is the reality, AIDS or no AIDS, but AIDS makes it very profoundly\nfelt, and that can become a blessing in disguise. The time for meditation has come. Now you can forget those small, stupid things in which you were involved.\nThere are millions of people who are playing cards, watching football matches – not at all aware of what they are doing. And if you ask them, they say they are killing time. Great! Time is killing you, and you remain with the idea that you are killing time. How can you kill time? You have never even seen it. Your swords cannot cut it, even your nuclear weapons are unable to touch it. How are you going to kill time?\nBut time is killing you every moment.\nAIDS should be understood as a great blessing. Now you can stop playing cards, you can stop fooling around. You can stop watching stupid football matches. Now all the time is yours, and the only thing left before death comes, is to know thyself. And the death is so close that you cannot afford to remain ignorant about your own being.\nThe very closeness of death makes it possible for you to understand the deathless which is within you. That’s the whole art of meditation: to go within as deep as you can to the very center of your being. And you will be surprised, amazed that at the center of your being you are eternal. There is no death, there has never been any death. Nothing dies in reality, it only changes forms.\nAIDS can destroy your body – but it is going to be destroyed anyway, there is not much problem. It is better that it is being destroyed by AIDS, because you cannot hope to survive; with AIDS your hope has also died. Now there is no cure, you have to face the fact. No help from the outside is available, you have to depend on your inside. You are left alone.\nIn fact everybody has always been alone.\nFrom birth to death, the whole journey is alone.\nYou may be in the crowd, but your aloneness cannot be destroyed. It is there. You make every effort to camouflage your aloneness, but nobody has ever succeeded in it. A truth is a truth – you may postpone it a little bit.…\nAIDS destroys all postponement.\nWhatever has to be done has to be done now!\nYes, one thing is certain, that you are a victim – a victim of your religions, a victim of your so-called prophets, messiahs, incarnations of God, God himself. You are a victim. Don’t try to hide the fact, that will not help.\nAIDS is the ultimate outcome of homosexuality, and homosexuality is a religious disease. It was born in the monasteries where no woman was allowed. It was born because of the insistence of all the religions of the world on celibacy – which is simply stupid. You cannot be celibate unless you are impotent.\nAnd remember, the impotent people have not given anything to the world. They don’t have any creative energy. Your sexual energy is your creativity. The impotent person is a hollow bamboo, nothing inside. He somehow drags on, but he is not living. He cannot live, he has no energy for living. He is condemned from his very birth. Only these people can be monks, nuns authentically.\nIf others who are full of life and energy become celibate, they will be destroyed fighting with themselves. They will destroy themselves fighting with their nature, and they can never be victorious. Nature is far bigger than you. You are just a tiny part, almost invisible. Nature is as big, as wide as the sky itself. You cannot fight with it.\nAnd it is very strange that nobody has said that celibacy should be illegal, that anybody trying to be celibate is mad! But all the religions insist that celibacy is something spiritual, something respectable, something divine.\nStrange, if there is a God, why does he go on giving you sexual energy? God gives you the sexual energy, and his representatives on the earth – the prophets, the messiahs, the popes, the imams – they are all against sex. To summarize: they are all against their God! And God has not listened to them even up to now. Each child comes fully equipped.\nCelibacy is the root cause of homosexuality, of all kinds of sexual perversions. But the priests have been reaping a good crop out of your perversions. The more perverted you are, the more you are\nin the hands of the priest, for the simple reason that you start feeling guilty. Going against nature makes you feel guilty, makes you feel disgusting, makes you feel unacceptable to yourself. You cannot have the dignity of a man if you are perverted. You lose all pride of being a man, the highest expression of evolution – consciousness. You hide your perversions.\nAnd remember, sex is not a problem, perversions are. Men have been making love to other men. Men have been making love to animals. Naturally, you will try to hide the fact that you are making love to animals. You have degraded yourself. You have reduced yourself to the state of animals.\nAnd it is strange that now Jerry Falwell-type idiots are telling people that AIDS is a punishment from God for homosexuality. That means all the people who have been the cause of creating it should be punished. Rather than punishing the popes, the imams, the shankaracharyas, the heads of other religions, he is punishing the poor victims. All shankaracharyas and all popes, and all imams, Ayatollah Khomeinis – these are the people who should suffer the punishment.\nBut this man, Jerry Falwell, is only a mouthpiece for all these popes, Ayatollah Khomeinis, shankaracharyas. He is saying that it is punishment from God for homosexuality.\nBut I would like to ask him a question. What has happened? God has suddenly changed his mind? – he has never been favorable to women up to now but lesbians are not punished by AIDS. Strange! God has always been a male chauvinist. For the first time he is punishing men. Lesbians are not suffering from AIDS, they are not being punished.\nAnd you should understand that the Christian trinity is a gay company – there is not a single woman. For the whole eternity, three male energies... what will they be doing? Your life is short – seventy years, eighty years, at the most ninety years. But this trinity, this triangle of homosexuals – what have they been doing all through eternity?\nIf AIDS has to happen, your God should be the first victim. Rather than being a victim, he is punishing you. Perhaps there is a reason in it.\nLet me remind you about the story of Adam and Eve. God had forbidden his own creations to eat from the tree of knowledge and from the tree of life. These two trees were forbidden. It was the great revolutionary, the serpent – the first revolutionary in the world – who persuaded Eve, “This is strange – God is your father, and the father is preventing his children from being wise, is forcing his children to remain ignorant forever. God is your father and he is preventing you from becoming eternally alive, from having the taste of eternal life.”\nThe serpent said, “Do you know why he is doing it? Because if you eat from these two trees, you yourselves will be gods – and he is jealous. He wants you to be slaves, not gods.”\nPerhaps that’s why he is punishing homosexuals. His company is homosexual, and you have some nerve to become homosexual – to try to be equal to God! Except that, I don’t see any reason that man should be punished.\nAnd you have not worshipped the serpent. You have condemned him as the devil. He gave you freedom, he gave you intelligence, he gave you inquiry. He made you human! Otherwise, you would\nstill be in the Garden of Eden chewing grass, naked, unashamed of being naked chewing grass. But that was the original idea of your God, the father who lives far away in heaven.\nBut the serpent could not do the full work. As God became aware that man had eaten the fruit of the tree of knowledge, he drove him out of the Garden of Eden. Man was expelled, because now the next step was certainly going to be the tree of eternal life.\nThese two trees are very significant. The tree of knowledge you can call science, because science means knowledge. And the tree of eternal life you can call religion, because religion is an inquiry into the eternity of existence.\nGod has forbidden you from both science and religion. And his priests, his prophets, his messiahs and saviors and messengers – they have been doing the same: condemning the serpent as the devil, praising God as the compassionate one. What kind of compassion is this? Can you call a father compassionate who prohibits his children from tasting the juice of eternal life? who prohibits them from becoming wise, aware, knowing?\nI cannot call God the compassionate one.\nHe is the most cruel father who has ever been.\nAnd the serpent is not the devil. He has immense compassion. He could see the strategy of God, and he managed to persuade Eve. That too is significant to remember; he did not approach Adam. To persuade a man is a difficult job. He will argue, because he lives in the head. The woman does not argue, she tries to understand; she lives in the heart.\nEve immediately understood the point that God is preventing them from becoming his equal. And on the part of the serpent, it was perfectly clever to persuade the woman – the husband is bound to follow the woman. There is no need to bother about the husband.\nSince Adam, every husband has been henpecked. He could have argued with the serpent, but who can argue with a woman? Impossible, they don’t understand each other’s language. You say something, the woman understands immediately something else that you never imagined! Conversation between a man and woman is an impossibility – particularly if they are husband and wife.\nThe serpent is the first blessing to humanity. If you want to worship, worship the serpent. God is not worth anything. His priests are the cause of creating homosexuality.\nEven Gautam Buddha, the most intelligent man as far as the world of religion is concerned, was not ready to allow women into his commune. Why? What is the fear? The fear is, if women are in the commune, then the celibacy of his disciples is in danger. But celibacy is impossible, there is no question of danger. The woman will only make your disciples natural, otherwise, they will be making love to each other. And that’s what Buddhist monks have been doing down the ages, Christian monks have been doing down the ages.\nNature has its own way of finding expression. If you repress the natural outlet, it will find something which is unnatural, which destroys you. AIDS is the culmination.\nAnd now whatsoever is being done by the priests and the politicians is simply stupid – still the priests go on preaching celibacy, its beauty, its spirituality.\nSometimes I wonder why there has not been a religion which preaches control of urination. And you can be certain, if somebody were there to preach control of urination, there are enough retarded people on the earth who would start doing it. Of course, they cannot – they will be hypocrites. Celibacy has made all the religions hypocritical, and has perverted them into unnatural ways. And they are still teaching celibacy.\nNobody looks at the cause of AIDS, at who is responsible for it. On the contrary, just the other day I came to know that in Texas they have made homosexuality illegal; and I was surprised that in Texas there are one million homosexuals. Now one million people have suddenly become criminals. Do you think your law against homosexuality is going to prevent homosexuality in those people?\nHas any law ever prevented anybody from doing anything? There are laws against murder; murder goes on growing. There are laws against suicide; suicide goes on growing. There are laws against stealing; you have to go on expanding your prisons, your courts, because the number of thieves goes on growing. There are laws against drugs. That simply makes things go underground. And anything which is underground has an immense attraction. Now in Texas, one million people will go underground.\nHomosexuality cannot be prevented by law. Law has never prevented anything! In fact, it makes the thing more attractive. These homosexuals going underground will cause the spread of AIDS more easily, because you will never know who is a homosexual. You will never know who has to be tested medically.\nThis stupid law in Texas is going to be followed everywhere! The homosexuals appealed it, but the court of appeals has rejected their appeal. The Texan law remains a law.\nIt is always good to bring things to the surface, then something can be done about them. Putting things underground is immensely dangerous. Now Texas will be spreading homosexuality, spreading AIDS, although those idiot politicians think that by making it illegal they have done some great job in preventing AIDS.\nIn England it used to be – just a hundred years ago – that thieves were hanged naked in the public square and beaten to unconsciousness. That was the punishment for the thieves. Why in the public square? So that everybody can see what happens if you steal, and can learn a lesson.\nBut soon they had to stop this practice of beating thieves, for the simple reason that a crowd gathered there to see a free show, and in the crowd there were pickpockets who were doing their job. People were focused on the criminal, they had forgotten their pockets. When it became known that even exactly on the spot where you are torturing a thief all the thieves are doing a great job.…\nNo law can prevent anything; it only makes it more attractive. It only drives things deeper into the unconscious, deeper into darkness where you cannot do anything.\nAIDS should be accepted.\nPriests should be condemned. Religions should be held responsible.\nDon’t be hard on the poor victims, help them. They are not going to live long.\nIn my own commune, every sannyasin is passing through the tests, because even if he has AIDS he is not going to be condemned for it. On the contrary, he will be given more respect, more love. He is a victim.\nWe have found only two persons who have AIDS. We have made for them the most beautiful house in the most scenic place. And we are giving them better treatment than any other sannyasin; they need it. They don’t feel guilty.\nAnd we have told them, “You read the literature that you always wanted to read, listen to the music that you always wanted to listen to but could not find the time, see the filmsNow you have enough\ntime – two years! Nobody is so rich as to have a two-year period completely to himself! Meditate. Use these two years for deep meditation, so that when death comes, you die in silence, in peace, in joy, because you will be knowing the fruit of the other tree – eternal life. You can die dancing, singing.”\nDeath is not a problem at all. What does it matter whether it comes from tuberculosis, or cancer, or AIDS? AIDS is the best, because there is no cure for it.\nBut in the outside world, information is being repressed. No government wants to give the actual number of how many people are suffering from AIDS, because to give that information reveals that the country is homosexual, the country is perverted.\nI had never known that Texas had one million homosexuals! It is because of the law that the homosexuals started protesting, came out to fight in the courts, declared their number.\nYou never know: if Texas has one million, how many million will California have? Perhaps everybody, except the lesbians.\nTo be a lesbian, for the first time has gained respect, spirituality. God has never been so favorable to woman – perhaps he is learning something from me. He has always mistreated women. He made man in a certain way, and the woman he made by taking out a rib of the man. Strangeif he can\nmake man, why can’t he also make the woman the same way? She has to be degraded, she is nothing but a bone.\nJerry Falwell is saying that the Bible is historical, and every word in it is truth and nothing else. The Bible’s preaching for women is that you are a slave to man and your only function is to be a factory for reproduction. These are truths?\nAnd this priest, Falwell, is going to meet Ronald Nixon – they both belong to the same group of fundamentalist Christians. He wants the Bible to be accepted by the government as the only holy and truthful book. And the Bible, if you ask me, is the worst pornographic book in the world. Even the\nSupreme Court, if they are fair, will have to categorize it “x-rated.” It should be prohibited. Everything ugly is there.\nRonald Nixon... I am not committing a mistake. Just the mask is of Reagan, behind the mask is Nixon. They are great friends. What Nixon could not do, he is now persuading Reagan to do. Reagan wants prayer to be introduced in all the schools, colleges, universities, academies – all kinds of educational institutions. What prayer? To whom?\nGod is still an unproved hypothesis. And do you pray to a hypothesis? – and that too, unproved? Has any prayer been heard ever? Has the sky ever answered?\nIt did not answer even Jesus Christ, who was simply nuts – calling himself the only begotten son of God. He was just a bastard. Every bastard can claim that he is the only begotten son of God, because the ordinary father is not his father. His father lives high above in the sky.\nEven Jesus Christ’s prayer on the cross was not answered. In deep frustration he shouted at the sky, “Have you forsaken me?” Still, no answer. If that is the situation of the only begotten son, what about other poor human beings who are just born out of their father and mother, mortals?\nThis book is holy? Then magazines like PLAYBOY, PLAYGIRL should start calling themselves holy magazines – of course, in color... glossy.\nYou say, “AIDS confronts us with the immediacy of death.” It is good that you become aware that\ndeath is there, absolutely certain. Now is the time to find something in you which is deathless, which is beyond death.\nYou cannot find a better time for meditation, at least in my commune. And don’t feel serious, because death is natural; what causes it is meaningless. Don’t be in a paranoia. In fact, rejoice that you are the chosen few; everybody else is in darkness about his death, you are not. And the very fact that you know death is coming is bound to create space for you to know yourself.\nThis will not happen in the outside world where they are declaring homosexuality illegal. This will not happen in the outside world, because even if a person is found with AIDS, he will bribe the physicians to keep the information secret. Your wife may have told you, “I will die for you,” but when she comes to know you have AIDS.… Your children, your parents, your friends – all will become your enemies. You will lose your job, you will lose your family, you will lose your dignity. You will be simply a condemned man.\nBefore AIDS kills you in the outside world, you will have to commit suicide. That is the only way for you, nothing else, because you will not be acceptable in any restaurant, you will not be acceptable in any club, you will not be acceptable anywhere, because the spread of AIDS is not confined only to sexual intercourse. Just kissing somebody is enough, or even a tear of somebody... out of compassion you just wipe off the tear, and you may get AIDS. Any liquid coming out of the body may carry the virus.\nHence I say to my people, stop kissing. Anyway, it is so unhygienic. Just think of the whole thing: mixing your saliva with somebody else, exploring somebody’s mouth with your tongue. Are you insane or something?\nAnd there are better ways to show love. In the oldest sexology book, which is five thousand years old, from India, Vatsyayana has given few a very significant ideas. For example, he says that the lobes of the ears are very erotic. They are. You play with your beloved’s earlobes, he plays with your earlobes. Perfectly hygienic, no stupidity involved, and a great adventure into new erotic spaces.\nEskimos rub their noses, they don’t kiss. When they first saw Christian missionaries they could not believe it: “What are these idiots doing? And if this is what they are doing, what religion are they going to teach to us?”\nNoses are so clean, so cool. Enjoy rubbing noses, except when you suffer from a cold. That is simply determined, there is no problem about it, because any liquid flowing from the nose may carry the virus.\nMassage each other’s body – that will be healthy, relaxing. Lie down with each other and meditate together; hugging each other, meditating together. And you will be surprised that you can reach better orgasmic, blissful moments than by having intercourse – which is very momentary. Find out new ways, and in finding new ways there is celebration.\nCelebrate! Dance with your beloved, sing with your beloved, play on the guitar with your beloved. For the new age, for the new man, there are going to be new ways of love too. And it is more sophisticated, more cultured.\nJesus says everybody has to carry his cross on his shoulders. I say to you, everybody has to carry his guitar. If you have to carry something, why not a guitar? Learn music, learn dancing. Your bedroom should become a temple. Right now it is a warfield.\nEvery night before you make love you have to fight; you have to throw pillows, you have to throw things, you have to argue about everything in the world – with no conclusion. And after all this nastiness, you make love. You don’t understand at all that this love is nothing but a way somehow to go to sleep, somehow to finish this nightmare. This is not love.\nBurn incense in your bedroom. No electricity, just candles. The dimmer the light, the more beautiful the body of your beloved looks. In darkness, all women become Cleopatra, all men become Romeo. Such a small trick... and you have Cleopatra and Romeo in the bed.\nAnd there is no need to make love either. Be loving, hug each other. Go to sleep together hugging, silently, meditatively, with the incense filling the room, with the candlelight.…\nIf man can be taught the beauties of being loving, all homosexuality will disappear, all kinds of perversions will disappear. They cannot disappear by making laws. And strangely enough, the people who make laws – the senators and the members of the parliaments, assemblies – most of them are homosexuals. But they are in a position that they can go on keeping it a secret. Even your popes have been found to be homosexuals, and they are preaching sermons to the whole world to remain celibate.\nWe have created such a hypocritical world. It is time to be finished with it! Be authentic, be sincere! Your question is significant.\nWe have those two unique sannyasins who have AIDS. Be respectful to them, be loving to them. Do everything that the commune can do for them, because their death is certain. Help them to meditate. If before death they can manage to enter into their being, they will have tasted the fruit of the other tree which Adam and Eve missed.\nIt is within you.\nAnd knowing your eternal being, knowing that you have been here always and you will be here always, is a tremendous revelation.\nIn that revelation is celebration. Question 2\nBELOVED OSHO,\nWHY IS THERE AN EGO? IT SEEMS SO ABSOLUTELY MEANINGLESS, AND NOT NECESSARY AT ALL – NON-EXISTENT ACTUALLY. DO YOU KNOW?\nI do not know, because I don’t have any ego. To know it one has to have it.\nI have looked within myself, searched within myself; I have not found it anywhere.\nAnd your question is strange. You say, “The ego is non-existent.” Then why are you asking questions about things which don’t exist? No, it is not non-existent for you, hence the question. Don’t try to deceive yourself.\nYou say, “It is meaningless, it serves no purpose.” That is not right. It serves great purpose. The purpose of the ego is to give you a false self – because the society, the religion, the country, the race in which you are born, does not want you to know your real self. That is dangerous, because the person who finds his real self is a rebel – and all the religions teach obedience.\nWhat was the fault of Adam and Eve? They disobeyed – such a small thing. Every child disobeys. In fact, only idiots never disobey, because to disobey a certain intelligence is needed. For obedience, no intelligence at all is needed. All machines are obedient, very spiritual. All machines will enter into paradise; they have never disobeyed.\nThe societies don’t want you to know your reality because that will make you an individual, that will give you courage and guts. That will make you brave enough to say no to a thousand and one things which have been imposed upon you. Your individuality will certainly make you capable of saying yes too, but only when your intelligence is convinced. The yes will come from within yourself, it will not be imposed from the outside.\nThat is the purpose of the ego. It is created by the societies, by the religions, by the politicians, by all the vested interests. And you are so foolish that you go on clinging to something which is arbitrary.\nThis is the whole art of meditation: to take you to your real self. The moment you come to your real self, the arbitrary ego disappears – in the same way that darkness disappears when you come with a burning torch inside the house.\nThe ego is the absence of your realization of your self. And it is there because your parents, your teachers, your priests, your leaders are all agreed that before you come to know who you are, you should be given a false substitute, a lollipop.\nIn India I have observed.Poor people cannot afford to have their women remain at home, they both\nhave to work. The work is hard, the country is hot, and they can get only unskilled work because they have never been able to be educated. In fact they have been prohibited from education for thousands of years. So they go on making the road, or cutting stones, or cutting wood.\nThe women also have to work, but what to do with the children? There may be a child so small... where to leave him? So they have found a method. They give a little dose of opium to the child. That is the common practice all over India. Then the child remains hungry but does not cry, he is hallucinating.\nIn his world of imagination he may be drinking, sucking milk from his mother’s breast – and all that he has is his own thumb in his mouth. But under the impact of opium he remains silent, lying down under a tree; the mother can work, the father can work. Opium takes care of the child.\nYour ego is the opium that has been given to you; otherwise, you were bound to discover your real self. But once you accept the ego as your real self, all inquiry stops. It has a purpose, but that purpose does not serve you or your interests. It serves the vested interests.\nAs far as you are concerned, your ego kills you, destroys your whole life. You are living in falsity, insincerity, inauthenticity – because everything you do is based on something which is not real!\nBut your question is not your realization. Making statements that “Ego has no purpose, no meaning, it is non-existent” – if this is your realization, why are you asking? It is not your realization.\nPlease, don’t be deluded. The society is very cunning, and it has made the ego really strong so that you never go beyond it. But there are methods and techniques to go beyond it; and only when you are beyond it does it become meaningless, purposeless, non-existent.\nThat’s my whole work: to make you realize your real center, so that the unreal can disappear. Question 3\nBELOVED OSHO,\nCAN YOU PLEASE TALK ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS TO BE TOTAL? IS IT THE SAME AS NOT BEING SPLIT, OR IS THERE MORE TO IT?\nNot to be split, not to be schizophrenic, is only the beginning. And then there is the whole infinity, the whole eternity of ecstasy, blissfulness, understanding, awareness. There is much more to it. My insistence on being total in each of your acts is just to give you the first step.\nBut the first step itself is so blissful, you would like to go a little more ahead, because the second step will be facing you.There is no end, you simply go on and on and on, and everything goes on\nexpanding. Even the sky is not the limit! You can spread yourself over the whole existence.\nBut a split person dies without knowing anything of life. And to make you split is very simple. Every society – cultured, uncultured, primitive, contemporary – they all have used the same methods to split you. The split is: they give you certain commandments – Do this, don’t do that. And the strategy is, what they say to do is unnatural, and what they say not to do is natural. Now you are split.\nThe child is helpless. He has to listen to the parents, to the teachers. He has to do things which he never wanted to do. He cannot do things which he has always been wanting to do. The split has happened.\nNow there are two persons in you: one, the unnatural, the conditioned; the other, the natural, that you have brought with yourself. And just as the method to split is easy, the method to drop the split is even more easy.\nDo whatever you want to do.\nNever do anything that goes against your nature.\nWhoever has said it – Moses, Abraham, Jesus, Krishna, Buddha, Confucius – whoever has said it does not matter.\nWhat matters is your natural self.\nFollow your nature, and drop all conditionings, programs that have been given to you by others. This makes you total.\nAnd this is only the first step of the pilgrimage towards eternity. Question 4\nBELOVED OSHO,\nWILL THE NEW WOMAN HAVE TO SUFFER THE INDIGNITIES OF “MONTHLY BLUES?”\nNever!\nThat is something which can be very easily changed. Man can reach to the moon – and he cannot stop poor women from suffering “the indignities of the monthly blues.” It is easy; science will find ways.…\nI will suggest that you be on the pill continuously; the blues will disappear, and the indignities will disappear. And the pain and the suffering that are bound to come with the blues will disappear.\nThe pill is the greatest revolution that has happened in the whole of history. And it is so cheap, so simple. But be on it continuously, don’t stop. Soon science will be able to find something, but before\nscience finds it, try my unscientific idea. I am not a medical man, but I know it works. You give it a try.\nOne thing you should also be made aware of: it is not only the woman who suffers the blues; man also suffers. But for centuries man has not been aware that he has a monthly course, for the simple reason that nothing comes out of his body, no blood – so he has been unaware.\nBut you just keep a diary. Go on writing down your moods for three, four months, and you will be surprised that every month, after twenty-eight days, comes the period of suffering, sadness, depression. And it comes always exactly every month.\nNow it is a well-established fact that man also has his periods. But that I leave to men; when they ask, I will suggest something. Right now, my concern is the woman.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"6075","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/from_death_to_deathlessness/part26/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/from_death_to_deathlessness/>From Death to Deathlessness</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">26 Your aloneness cannot be destroyed</h1><div class=post-meta>29 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;6075 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/From_Death_to_Deathlessness/part26.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part25>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

OUR SERIOUSNESS
SEEMS TO CREATE MORE DISEASE AND PARANOIA. INSTEAD OF FEELING LIKE
VICTIMS, HOW CAN WE RESPOND THROUGH CELEBRATION?</p><p><br></p><p>Death is always there. You may be unaware of it, but it is always
confronting you with immediacy. You cannot be certain of the next
moment.</p><p><br></p><p>But we go on living – and nobody believes that he is going to die; it
is always the other who dies. You have seen people dying, many people of
all kinds – children, young people, old people – but you have never seen
yourself dying. So obviously somewhere in your mind the idea persists
that it is always the other who dies. But remember, those who are dead
also had the same idea; for them you are the other. And one day you will
be dying, and the people who will take you to the graveyard will not
feel at all the immediacy of death.</p><p><br></p><p>It is always there – just like a shadow to you. From the very first
moment of your birth you have been dying. It is a fallacy to think that
death comes like an accident, suddenly when you are seventy, eighty,
ninety. No. Death and life are together. The moment you are born you
start dying.</p><p><br></p><p>But man is very clever in deceiving himself.</p><p>Each of your birthdays is an effort to forget that it is not your
birthday, it is your death day; you have died one year more. But with
flowers and candles and cakes, one forgets the immediacy of death. It is
always with you.</p><p><br></p><p>Birth is the beginning of death.</p><p><br></p><p>So AIDS in fact should not make you serious; on the contrary it
should make you more alert, more aware, because you are a rare person
for whom death is a certainty, and you cannot deceive yourself
anymore.</p><p><br></p><p>Many who do not have AIDS will be dying before you, but their death
will be coming without their knowing. And to know is always better than
not to know. Something can be done when you know a fact is going to
happen.</p><p><br></p><p>The AIDS patient knows that within two years he is going to die. This
immediacy of death should wake you up. Now there is no more time for you
to fool around, no time for you to deceive yourself. Death is just there
waiting for you, and you are fortunate that you know it.</p><p><br></p><p>Knowing of your death can become a transformation.</p><p><br></p><p>If you know you are going to die within two years, these two years
can be devoted to meditation. Otherwise people are always postponing;
they will meditate tomorrow – and tomorrow never comes. And there are so
many other things to do, you don’t have time for meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>But a man who is fully aware that now there is no way, that tomorrow
is finished, all that you have in your hands is this moment.<span class=s4></span>This is the reality, AIDS or no AIDS, but AIDS makes
it very profoundly</p><p>felt, and that can become a blessing in disguise. The time for
meditation has come. Now you can forget those small, stupid things in
which you were involved.</p><p><br></p><p>There are millions of people who are playing cards, watching football
matches – not at all aware of what they are doing. And if you ask them,
they say they are killing time. Great! Time is killing you, and you
remain with the idea that you are killing time. How can you kill time?
You have never even seen it. Your swords cannot cut it, even your
nuclear weapons are unable to touch it. How are you going to kill
time?</p><p><br></p><p>But time is killing you every moment.</p><p><br></p><p>AIDS should be understood as a great blessing. Now you can stop
playing cards, you can stop fooling around. You can stop watching stupid
football matches. Now all the time is yours, and the only thing left
before death comes, is to know thyself. And the death is so close that
you cannot afford to remain ignorant about your own being.</p><p><br></p><p>The very closeness of death makes it possible for you to understand
the deathless which is within you. That’s the whole art of meditation:
to go within as deep as you can to the very center of your being. And
you will be surprised, amazed that at the center of your being you are
eternal. There is no death, there has never been any death. Nothing dies
in reality, it only changes forms.</p><p>AIDS can destroy your body – but it is going to be destroyed anyway,
there is not much problem. It is better that it is being destroyed by
AIDS, because you cannot hope to survive; with AIDS your hope has also
died. Now there is no cure, you have to face the fact. No help from the
outside is available, you have to depend on your inside. You are left
alone.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact everybody has always been alone.</p><p><br></p><p>From birth to death, the whole journey is alone.</p><p><br></p><p>You may be in the crowd, but your aloneness cannot be destroyed. It
is there. You make every effort to camouflage your aloneness, but nobody
has ever succeeded in it. A truth is a truth – you may postpone it a
little bit.…</p><p><br></p><p>AIDS destroys all postponement.</p><p><br></p><p>Whatever has to be done has to be done now!</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, one thing is certain, that you are a victim – a victim of your
religions, a victim of your so-called prophets, messiahs, incarnations
of God, God himself. You are a victim. Don’t try to hide the fact, that
will not help.</p><p><br></p><p>AIDS is the ultimate outcome of homosexuality, and homosexuality is a
religious disease. It was born in the monasteries where no woman was
allowed. It was born because of the insistence of all the religions of
the world on celibacy – which is simply stupid. You cannot be celibate
unless you are impotent.</p><p><br></p><p>And remember, the impotent people have not given anything to the
world. They don’t have any creative energy. Your sexual energy is your
creativity. The impotent person is a hollow bamboo, nothing inside. He
somehow drags on, but he is not living. He cannot live, he has no energy
for living. He is condemned from his very birth. Only these people can
be monks, nuns authentically.</p><p><br></p><p>If others who are full of life and energy become celibate, they will
be destroyed fighting with themselves. They will destroy themselves
fighting with their nature, and they can never be victorious. Nature is
far bigger than you. You are just a tiny part, almost invisible. Nature
is as big, as wide as the sky itself. You cannot fight with it.</p><p><br></p><p>And it is very strange that nobody has said that celibacy should be
illegal, that anybody trying to be celibate is mad! But all the
religions insist that celibacy is something spiritual, something
respectable, something divine.</p><p><br></p><p>Strange, if there is a God, why does he go on giving you sexual
energy? God gives you the sexual energy, and his representatives on the
earth – the prophets, the messiahs, the popes, the imams – they are all
against sex. To summarize: they are all against their God! And God has
not listened to them even up to now. Each child comes fully
equipped.</p><p><br></p><p>Celibacy is the root cause of homosexuality, of all kinds of sexual
perversions. But the priests have been reaping a good crop out of your
perversions. The more perverted you are, the more you are</p><p>in the hands of the priest, for the simple reason that you start
feeling guilty. Going against nature makes you feel guilty, makes you
feel disgusting, makes you feel unacceptable to yourself. You cannot
have the dignity of a man if you are perverted. You lose all pride of
being a man, the highest expression of evolution – consciousness. You
hide your perversions.</p><p><br></p><p>And remember, sex is not a problem, perversions are. Men have been
making love to other men. Men have been making love to animals.
Naturally, you will try to hide the fact that you are making love to
animals. You have degraded yourself. You have reduced yourself to the
state of animals.</p><p><br></p><p>And it is strange that now Jerry Falwell-type idiots are telling
people that AIDS is a punishment from God for homosexuality. That means
all the people who have been the cause of creating it should be
punished. Rather than punishing the popes, the imams, the
shankaracharyas, the heads of other religions, he is punishing the poor
victims. All shankaracharyas and all popes, and all imams, Ayatollah
Khomeinis – these are the people who should suffer the punishment.</p><p><br></p><p>But this man, Jerry Falwell, is only a mouthpiece for all these
popes, Ayatollah Khomeinis, shankaracharyas. He is saying that it is
punishment from God for homosexuality.</p><p><br></p><p>But I would like to ask him a question. What has happened? God has
suddenly changed his mind? – he has never been favorable to women up to
now but lesbians are not punished by AIDS. Strange! God has always been
a male chauvinist. For the first time he is punishing men. Lesbians are
not suffering from AIDS, they are not being punished.</p><p><br></p><p>And you should understand that the Christian trinity is a gay company
– there is not a single woman. For the whole eternity, three male
energies... what will they be doing? Your life is short – seventy years,
eighty years, at the most ninety years. But this trinity, this triangle
of homosexuals – what have they been doing all through eternity?</p><p><br></p><p>If AIDS has to happen, your God should be the first victim. Rather
than being a victim, he is punishing you. Perhaps there is a reason in
it.</p><p><br></p><p>Let me remind you about the story of Adam and Eve. God had forbidden
his own creations to eat from the tree of knowledge and from the tree of
life. These two trees were forbidden. It was the great revolutionary,
the serpent – the first revolutionary in the world – who persuaded Eve,
“This is strange – God is your father, and the father is preventing his
children from being wise, is forcing his children to remain ignorant
forever. God is your father and he is preventing you from becoming
eternally alive, from having the taste of eternal life.”</p><p><br></p><p>The serpent said, “Do you know why he is doing it? Because if you eat
from these two trees, you yourselves will be gods – and he is jealous.
He wants you to be slaves, not gods.”</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps that’s why he is punishing homosexuals. His company is
homosexual, and you have some nerve to become homosexual – to try to be
equal to God! Except that, I don’t see any reason that man should be
punished.</p><p><br></p><p>And you have not worshipped the serpent. You have condemned him as
the devil. He gave you freedom, he gave you intelligence, he gave you
inquiry. He made you human! Otherwise, you would</p><p>still be in the Garden of Eden chewing grass, naked, unashamed of
being naked chewing grass. But that was the original idea of your God,
the father who lives far away in heaven.</p><p><br></p><p>But the serpent could not do the full work. As God became aware that
man had eaten the fruit of the tree of knowledge, he drove him out of
the Garden of Eden. Man was expelled, because now the next step was
certainly going to be the tree of eternal life.</p><p><br></p><p>These two trees are very significant. The tree of knowledge you can
call science, because science means knowledge. And the tree of eternal
life you can call religion, because religion is an inquiry into the
eternity of existence.</p><p><br></p><p>God has forbidden you from both science and religion. And his
priests, his prophets, his messiahs and saviors and messengers – they
have been doing the same: condemning the serpent as the devil, praising
God as the compassionate one. What kind of compassion is this? Can you
call a father compassionate who prohibits his children from tasting the
juice of eternal life? who prohibits them from becoming wise, aware,
knowing?</p><p><br></p><p>I cannot call God the compassionate one.</p><p><br></p><p>He is the most cruel father who has ever been.</p><p><br></p><p>And the serpent is not the devil. He has immense compassion. He could
see the strategy of God, and he managed to persuade Eve. That too is
significant to remember; he did not approach Adam. To persuade a man is
a difficult job. He will argue, because he lives in the head. The woman
does not argue, she tries to understand; she lives in the heart.</p><p><br></p><p>Eve immediately understood the point that God is preventing them from
becoming his equal. And on the part of the serpent, it was perfectly
clever to persuade the woman – the husband is bound to follow the woman.
There is no need to bother about the husband.</p><p><br></p><p>Since Adam, every husband has been henpecked. He could have argued
with the serpent, but who can argue with a woman? Impossible, they don’t
understand each other’s language. You say something, the woman
understands immediately something else that you never imagined!
Conversation between a man and woman is an impossibility – particularly
if they are husband and wife.</p><p><br></p><p>The serpent is the first blessing to humanity. If you want to
worship, worship the serpent. God is not worth anything. His priests are
the cause of creating homosexuality.</p><p><br></p><p>Even Gautam Buddha, the most intelligent man as far as the world of
religion is concerned, was not ready to allow women into his commune.
Why? What is the fear? The fear is, if women are in the commune, then
the celibacy of his disciples is in danger. But celibacy is impossible,
there is no question of danger. The woman will only make your disciples
natural, otherwise, they will be making love to each other. And that’s
what Buddhist monks have been doing down the ages, Christian monks have
been doing down the ages.</p><p><br></p><p>Nature has its own way of finding expression. If you repress the
natural outlet, it will find something which is unnatural, which
destroys you. AIDS is the culmination.</p><p>And now whatsoever is being done by the priests and the politicians
is simply stupid – still the priests go on preaching celibacy, its
beauty, its spirituality.</p><p><br></p><p>Sometimes I wonder why there has not been a religion which preaches
control of urination. And you can be certain, if somebody were there to
preach control of urination, there are enough retarded people on the
earth who would start doing it. Of course, they cannot – they will be
hypocrites. Celibacy has made all the religions hypocritical, and has
perverted them into unnatural ways. And they are still teaching
celibacy.</p><p><br></p><p>Nobody looks at the cause of AIDS, at who is responsible for it. On
the contrary, just the other day I came to know that in Texas they have
made homosexuality illegal; and I was surprised that in Texas there are
one million homosexuals. Now one million people have suddenly become
criminals. Do you think your law against homosexuality is going to
prevent homosexuality in those people?</p><p><br></p><p>Has any law ever prevented anybody from doing anything? There are
laws against murder; murder goes on growing. There are laws against
suicide; suicide goes on growing. There are laws against stealing; you
have to go on expanding your prisons, your courts, because the number of
thieves goes on growing. There are laws against drugs. That simply makes
things go underground. And anything which is underground has an immense
attraction. Now in Texas, one million people will go underground.</p><p><br></p><p>Homosexuality cannot be prevented by law. Law has never prevented
anything! In fact, it makes the thing more attractive. These homosexuals
going underground will cause the spread of AIDS more easily, because you
will never know who is a homosexual. You will never know who has to be
tested medically.</p><p><br></p><p>This stupid law in Texas is going to be followed everywhere! The
homosexuals appealed it, but the court of appeals has rejected their
appeal. The Texan law remains a law.</p><p><br></p><p>It is always good to bring things to the surface, then something can
be done about them. Putting things underground is immensely dangerous.
Now Texas will be spreading homosexuality, spreading AIDS, although
those idiot politicians think that by making it illegal they have done
some great job in preventing AIDS.</p><p><br></p><p>In England it used to be – just a hundred years ago – that thieves
were hanged naked in the public square and beaten to unconsciousness.
That was the punishment for the thieves. Why in the public square? So
that everybody can see what happens if you steal, and can learn a
lesson.</p><p><br></p><p>But soon they had to stop this practice of beating thieves, for the
simple reason that a crowd gathered there to see a free show, and in the
crowd there were pickpockets who were doing their job. People were
focused on the criminal, they had forgotten their pockets. When it
became known that even exactly on the spot where you are torturing a
thief all the thieves are doing a great job.…</p><p><br></p><p>No law can prevent anything; it only makes it more attractive. It
only drives things deeper into the unconscious, deeper into darkness
where you cannot do anything.</p><p><br></p><p>AIDS should be accepted.</p><p>Priests should be condemned. Religions should be held
responsible.</p><p>Don’t be hard on the poor victims, help them. They are not going to
live long.</p><p><br></p><p>In my own commune, every sannyasin is passing through the tests,
because even if he has AIDS he is not going to be condemned for it. On
the contrary, he will be given more respect, more love. He is a
victim.</p><p><br></p><p>We have found only two persons who have AIDS. We have made for them
the most beautiful house in the most scenic place. And we are giving
them better treatment than any other sannyasin; they need it. They don’t
feel guilty.</p><p><br></p><p>And we have told them, “You read the literature that you always
wanted to read, listen to the music that you always wanted to listen to
but could not find the time, see the films<span class=s4></span>Now
you have enough</p><p>time – two years! Nobody is so rich as to have a two-year period
completely to himself! Meditate. Use these two years for deep
meditation, so that when death comes, you die in silence, in peace, in
joy, because you will be knowing the fruit of the other tree – eternal
life. You can die dancing, singing.”</p><p><br></p><p>Death is not a problem at all. What does it matter whether it comes
from tuberculosis, or cancer, or AIDS? AIDS is the best, because there
is no cure for it.</p><p><br></p><p>But in the outside world, information is being repressed. No
government wants to give the actual number of how many people are
suffering from AIDS, because to give that information reveals that the
country is homosexual, the country is perverted.</p><p><br></p><p>I had never known that Texas had one million homosexuals! It is
because of the law that the homosexuals started protesting, came out to
fight in the courts, declared their number.</p><p><br></p><p>You never know: if Texas has one million, how many million will
California have? Perhaps everybody, except the lesbians.</p><p><br></p><p>To be a lesbian, for the first time has gained respect, spirituality.
God has never been so favorable to woman – perhaps he is learning
something from me. He has always mistreated women. He made man in a
certain way, and the woman he made by taking out a rib of the man.
Strange<span class=s4></span>if he can</p><p>make man, why can’t he also make the woman the same way? She has to
be degraded, she is nothing but a bone.</p><p><br></p><p>Jerry Falwell is saying that the Bible is historical, and every word
in it is truth and nothing else. The Bible’s preaching for women is that
you are a slave to man and your only function is to be a factory for
reproduction. These are truths?</p><p><br></p><p>And this priest, Falwell, is going to meet Ronald Nixon – they both
belong to the same group of fundamentalist Christians. He wants the
Bible to be accepted by the government as the only holy and truthful
book. And the Bible, if you ask me, is the worst pornographic book in
the world. Even the</p><p>Supreme Court, if they are fair, will have to categorize it
“x-rated.” It should be prohibited. Everything ugly is there.</p><p><br></p><p>Ronald Nixon... I am not committing a mistake. Just the mask is of
Reagan, behind the mask is Nixon. They are great friends. What Nixon
could not do, he is now persuading Reagan to do. Reagan wants prayer to
be introduced in all the schools, colleges, universities, academies –
all kinds of educational institutions. What prayer? To whom?</p><p><br></p><p>God is still an unproved hypothesis. And do you pray to a hypothesis?
– and that too, unproved? Has any prayer been heard ever? Has the sky
ever answered?</p><p><br></p><p>It did not answer even Jesus Christ, who was simply nuts – calling
himself the only begotten son of God. He was just a bastard. Every
bastard can claim that he is the only begotten son of God, because the
ordinary father is not his father. His father lives high above in the
sky.</p><p><br></p><p>Even Jesus Christ’s prayer on the cross was not answered. In deep
frustration he shouted at the sky, “Have you forsaken me?” Still, no
answer. If that is the situation of the only begotten son, what about
other poor human beings who are just born out of their father and
mother, mortals?</p><p><br></p><p>This book is holy? Then magazines like PLAYBOY, PLAYGIRL should start
calling themselves holy magazines – of course, in color... glossy.</p><p><br></p><p>You say, “AIDS confronts us with the immediacy of death.<span class=s4></span>” It is good that you become aware that</p><p>death is there, absolutely certain. Now is the time to find something
in you which is deathless, which is beyond death.</p><p><br></p><p>You cannot find a better time for meditation, at least in my commune.
And don’t feel serious, because death is natural; what causes it is
meaningless. Don’t be in a paranoia. In fact, rejoice that you are the
chosen few; everybody else is in darkness about his death, you are not.
And the very fact that you know death is coming is bound to create space
for you to know yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>This will not happen in the outside world where they are declaring
homosexuality illegal. This will not happen in the outside world,
because even if a person is found with AIDS, he will bribe the
physicians to keep the information secret. Your wife may have told you,
“I will die for you,” but when she comes to know you have AIDS.… Your
children, your parents, your friends – all will become your enemies. You
will lose your job, you will lose your family, you will lose your
dignity. You will be simply a condemned man.</p><p><br></p><p>Before AIDS kills you in the outside world, you will have to commit
suicide. That is the only way for you, nothing else, because you will
not be acceptable in any restaurant, you will not be acceptable in any
club, you will not be acceptable anywhere, because the spread of AIDS is
not confined only to sexual intercourse. Just kissing somebody is
enough, or even a tear of somebody... out of compassion you just wipe
off the tear, and you may get AIDS. Any liquid coming out of the body
may carry the virus.</p><p><br></p><p>Hence I say to my people, stop kissing. Anyway, it is so unhygienic.
Just think of the whole thing: mixing your saliva with somebody else,
exploring somebody’s mouth with your tongue. Are you insane or
something?</p><p>And there are better ways to show love. In the oldest sexology book,
which is five thousand years old, from India, Vatsyayana has given few a
very significant ideas. For example, he says that the lobes of the ears
are very erotic. They are. You play with your beloved’s earlobes, he
plays with your earlobes. Perfectly hygienic, no stupidity involved, and
a great adventure into new erotic spaces.</p><p><br></p><p>Eskimos rub their noses, they don’t kiss. When they first saw
Christian missionaries they could not believe it: “What are these idiots
doing? And if this is what they are doing, what religion are they going
to teach to us?”</p><p><br></p><p>Noses are so clean, so cool. Enjoy rubbing noses, except when you
suffer from a cold. That is simply determined, there is no problem about
it, because any liquid flowing from the nose may carry the virus.</p><p><br></p><p>Massage each other’s body – that will be healthy, relaxing. Lie down
with each other and meditate together; hugging each other, meditating
together. And you will be surprised that you can reach better orgasmic,
blissful moments than by having intercourse – which is very momentary.
Find out new ways, and in finding new ways there is celebration.</p><p><br></p><p>Celebrate! Dance with your beloved, sing with your beloved, play on
the guitar with your beloved. For the new age, for the new man, there
are going to be new ways of love too. And it is more sophisticated, more
cultured.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus says everybody has to carry his cross on his shoulders. I say
to you, everybody has to carry his guitar. If you have to carry
something, why not a guitar? Learn music, learn dancing. Your bedroom
should become a temple. Right now it is a warfield.</p><p><br></p><p>Every night before you make love you have to fight; you have to throw
pillows, you have to throw things, you have to argue about everything in
the world – with no conclusion. And after all this nastiness, you make
love. You don’t understand at all that this love is nothing but a way
somehow to go to sleep, somehow to finish this nightmare. This is not
love.</p><p><br></p><p>Burn incense in your bedroom. No electricity, just candles. The
dimmer the light, the more beautiful the body of your beloved looks. In
darkness, all women become Cleopatra, all men become Romeo. Such a small
trick... and you have Cleopatra and Romeo in the bed.</p><p><br></p><p>And there is no need to make love either. Be loving, hug each other.
Go to sleep together hugging, silently, meditatively, with the incense
filling the room, with the candlelight.…</p><p><br></p><p>If man can be taught the beauties of being loving, all homosexuality
will disappear, all kinds of perversions will disappear. They cannot
disappear by making laws. And strangely enough, the people who make laws
– the senators and the members of the parliaments, assemblies – most of
them are homosexuals. But they are in a position that they can go on
keeping it a secret. Even your popes have been found to be homosexuals,
and they are preaching sermons to the whole world to remain
celibate.</p><p>We have created such a hypocritical world. It is time to be finished
with it! Be authentic, be sincere! Your question is significant.</p><p>We have those two unique sannyasins who have AIDS. Be respectful to
them, be loving to them. Do everything that the commune can do for them,
because their death is certain. Help them to meditate. If before death
they can manage to enter into their being, they will have tasted the
fruit of the other tree which Adam and Eve missed.</p><p><br></p><p>It is within you.</p><p><br></p><p>And knowing your eternal being, knowing that you have been here
always and you will be here always, is a tremendous revelation.</p><p><br></p><p>In that revelation is celebration. Question 2</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>WHY IS THERE AN EGO? IT SEEMS SO ABSOLUTELY MEANINGLESS, AND NOT
NECESSARY AT ALL – NON-EXISTENT ACTUALLY. DO YOU KNOW?</p><p><br></p><p>I do not know, because I don’t have any ego. To know it one has to
have it.</p><p>I have looked within myself, searched within myself; I have not found
it anywhere.</p><p><br></p><p>And your question is strange. You say, “The ego is non-existent.”
Then why are you asking questions about things which don’t exist? No, it
is not non-existent for you, hence the question. Don’t try to deceive
yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>You say, “It is meaningless, it serves no purpose.” That is not
right. It serves great purpose. The purpose of the ego is to give you a
false self – because the society, the religion, the country, the race in
which you are born, does not want you to know your real self. That is
dangerous, because the person who finds his real self is a rebel – and
all the religions teach obedience.</p><p><br></p><p>What was the fault of Adam and Eve? They disobeyed – such a small
thing. Every child disobeys. In fact, only idiots never disobey, because
to disobey a certain intelligence is needed. For obedience, no
intelligence at all is needed. All machines are obedient, very
spiritual. All machines will enter into paradise; they have never
disobeyed.</p><p><br></p><p>The societies don’t want you to know your reality because that will
make you an individual, that will give you courage and guts. That will
make you brave enough to say no to a thousand and one things which have
been imposed upon you. Your individuality will certainly make you
capable of saying yes too, but only when your intelligence is convinced.
The yes will come from within yourself, it will not be imposed from the
outside.</p><p><br></p><p>That is the purpose of the ego. It is created by the societies, by
the religions, by the politicians, by all the vested interests. And you
are so foolish that you go on clinging to something which is
arbitrary.</p><p>This is the whole art of meditation: to take you to your real self.
The moment you come to your real self, the arbitrary ego disappears – in
the same way that darkness disappears when you come with a burning torch
inside the house.</p><p><br></p><p>The ego is the absence of your realization of your self. And it is
there because your parents, your teachers, your priests, your leaders
are all agreed that before you come to know who you are, you should be
given a false substitute, a lollipop.</p><p><br></p><p>In India I have observed.<span class=s4></span>Poor people cannot
afford to have their women remain at home, they both</p><p>have to work. The work is hard, the country is hot, and they can get
only unskilled work because they have never been able to be educated. In
fact they have been prohibited from education for thousands of years. So
they go on making the road, or cutting stones, or cutting wood.</p><p><br></p><p>The women also have to work, but what to do with the children? There
may be a child so small... where to leave him? So they have found a
method. They give a little dose of opium to the child. That is the
common practice all over India. Then the child remains hungry but does
not cry, he is hallucinating.</p><p><br></p><p>In his world of imagination he may be drinking, sucking milk from his
mother’s breast – and all that he has is his own thumb in his mouth. But
under the impact of opium he remains silent, lying down under a tree;
the mother can work, the father can work. Opium takes care of the
child.</p><p><br></p><p>Your ego is the opium that has been given to you; otherwise, you were
bound to discover your real self. But once you accept the ego as your
real self, all inquiry stops. It has a purpose, but that purpose does
not serve you or your interests. It serves the vested interests.</p><p><br></p><p>As far as you are concerned, your ego kills you, destroys your whole
life. You are living in falsity, insincerity, inauthenticity – because
everything you do is based on something which is not real!</p><p><br></p><p>But your question is not your realization. Making statements that
“Ego has no purpose, no meaning, it is non-existent” – if this is your
realization, why are you asking? It is not your realization.</p><p><br></p><p>Please, don’t be deluded. The society is very cunning, and it has
made the ego really strong so that you never go beyond it. But there are
methods and techniques to go beyond it; and only when you are beyond it
does it become meaningless, purposeless, non-existent.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s my whole work: to make you realize your real center, so that
the unreal can disappear. Question 3</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>CAN YOU PLEASE TALK ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS TO BE TOTAL? IS IT THE SAME
AS NOT BEING SPLIT, OR IS THERE MORE TO IT?</p><p><br></p><p>Not to be split, not to be schizophrenic, is only the beginning. And
then there is the whole infinity, the whole eternity of ecstasy,
blissfulness, understanding, awareness. There is much more to it. My
insistence on being total in each of your acts is just to give you the
first step.</p><p>But the first step itself is so blissful, you would like to go a
little more ahead, because the second step will be facing you.<span class=s4></span>There is no end, you simply go on and on and on, and
everything goes on</p><p>expanding. Even the sky is not the limit! You can spread yourself
over the whole existence.</p><p><br></p><p>But a split person dies without knowing anything of life. And to make
you split is very simple. Every society – cultured, uncultured,
primitive, contemporary – they all have used the same methods to split
you. The split is: they give you certain commandments – Do this, don’t
do that. And the strategy is, what they say to do is unnatural, and what
they say not to do is natural. Now you are split.</p><p><br></p><p>The child is helpless. He has to listen to the parents, to the
teachers. He has to do things which he never wanted to do. He cannot do
things which he has always been wanting to do. The split has
happened.</p><p><br></p><p>Now there are two persons in you: one, the unnatural, the
conditioned; the other, the natural, that you have brought with
yourself. And just as the method to split is easy, the method to drop
the split is even more easy.</p><p><br></p><p>Do whatever you want to do.</p><p><br></p><p>Never do anything that goes against your nature.</p><p><br></p><p>Whoever has said it – Moses, Abraham, Jesus, Krishna, Buddha,
Confucius – whoever has said it does not matter.</p><p><br></p><p>What matters is your natural self.</p><p><br></p><p>Follow your nature, and drop all conditionings, programs that have
been given to you by others. This makes you total.</p><p>And this is only the first step of the pilgrimage towards eternity.
Question 4</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>WILL THE NEW WOMAN HAVE TO SUFFER THE INDIGNITIES OF “MONTHLY
BLUES?”</p><p><br></p><p>Never!</p><p><br></p><p>That is something which can be very easily changed. Man can reach to
the moon – and he cannot stop poor women from suffering “the indignities
of the monthly blues.” It is easy; science will find ways.…</p><p><br></p><p>I will suggest that you be on the pill continuously; the blues will
disappear, and the indignities will disappear. And the pain and the
suffering that are bound to come with the blues will disappear.</p><p><br></p><p>The pill is the greatest revolution that has happened in the whole of
history. And it is so cheap, so simple. But be on it continuously, don’t
stop. Soon science will be able to find something, but before</p><p>science finds it, try my unscientific idea. I am not a medical man,
but I know it works. You give it a try.</p><p><br></p><p>One thing you should also be made aware of: it is not only the woman
who suffers the blues; man also suffers. But for centuries man has not
been aware that he has a monthly course, for the simple reason that
nothing comes out of his body, no blood – so he has been unaware.</p><p><br></p><p>But you just keep a diary. Go on writing down your moods for three,
four months, and you will be surprised that every month, after
twenty-eight days, comes the period of suffering, sadness, depression.
And it comes always exactly every month.</p><p><br></p><p>Now it is a well-established fact that man also has his periods. But
that I leave to men; when they ask, I will suggest something. Right now,
my concern is the woman.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part25>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

‌CHAPTER 1
The Golden Mean
31 December 1978 am in Buddha Hall
LISTEN, AND IN THINE HEART ENGRAVE MY WORDS, KEEP CLOSED BOTH EYE AND EAR ’GAINST PREJUDICE, OF OTHERS THE EXAMPLE FEAR; THINK FOR THYSELF.
CONSULT, DELIBERATE, AND FREELY CHOOSE.
LET FOOLS ACT AIMLESSLY AND WITHOUT CAUSE, THOU SHOULDST, IN THE PRESENT; CONTEMPLATE THE FUTURE.
THAT WHICH THOU DOST NOT KNOW, PRETEND NOT THAT THOU DOST.</description>

‌CHAPTER 10
Known, Unknown, Unknowable
9 January 1979 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1
OSHO, WHICH IS THE REAL QUESTION?
Sudhir,
SCIENTIFIC QUESTIONS ARE ALL REAL, because they are answerable. Religious questions are all unreal because they are unanswerable.
Religion is the concern with the unanswerable. To ask a religious question is basically wrong – it is wrong because religion is the search for the mystery, not the search for the answer.</description>

‌CHAPTER 11
Only God Is
10 January 1979 am in Buddha Hall
... THAT THESE UNFORTUNATES SEEK AFAR THE GOODNESS WHOSE SOURCE WITHIN THEY BEAR.
FOR FEW KNOW HAPPINESS: PLAYTHINGS OF THE PASSIONS, HITHER; HITHER TOSSED BY ADVERSE WAVES, UPON A SHORELESS SEA, THEY BLINDED ROLL, UNABLE TO RESIST OR TO THE TEMPEST YIELD.
GOD! THOU COULDST SAVE THEM BY OPENING THEIR EYES.
BUT NO: ’TIS FOR THE HUMANS OF A RACE DIVINE TO DISCERN ERROR, AND TO SEE THE TRUTH.</description>

‌CHAPTER 2
Zorba The Buddha
1 January 1979 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1
OSHO, RIGHT NOW, HERE, I COULD DRINK YOU, SHARE IN YOUR BUDDHAHOOD, BUT I DON’T. DAY AFTER DAY, I DON’T. BELOVED OSHO, IS OUR CONDITIONING THAT DIFFICULT TO DROP?
Rashid,
THE MOST DIFFICULT THING IN LIFE IS TO DROP THE past – because to drop the past means to drop the whole identity, to drop the whole personality.</description>

‌CHAPTER 3
Don’t Spit on the Ceiling!
2 January 1979 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1
OSHO, EVERYTHING SEEMS SO UNREAL, LIKE A DREAM. TO ME, YOU SEEM TO BE SO UNREAL, FLOATING IN AND OUT OF DISCOURSE EACH DAY. I DO FEEL SOMETHING DEEP INSIDE HAPPENING IN YOUR PRESENCE, AND MORE EACH MOMENT BEING HERE WITH YOU, BUT I CANNOT SEEM TO FEEL A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING.</description>

‌CHAPTER 4
The Perfume of Absolute Contentment
3 January 1979 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1
OSHO, AS WELL AS BEING SOMEONE LIKE YOU, PYTHAGORAS WAS ALSO A GREAT MATHEMATICIAN. HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?
Bruno,
MAN IS NOT ONLY THE OUTER, and he is not only the inner either – he is both. And more: he is inner, he is outer, and he is transcendental too.</description>

‌CHAPTER 5
Love is Always Virgin
4 January 1979 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1
OSHO, YOU SAY THAT YOUR MAIN CONCERN IS OUR SPIRITUAL NOT OUR PSYCHOLOGICAL GROWTH. WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM?
Deva Yachana,
MAN IS A THREE-STOREYED BUILDING: one body, the mind and the soul. The body contains only the body. The mind contains body and mind both.</description>

‌CHAPTER 6
Enlightenment is Your Birthright
5 January 1979 am in Buddha Hall
LET NO SLEEP E’ER CLOSE THY TIRED EYES, WITHOUT THOU ASK THYSELF: WHAT HAVE I OMITTED, AND WHAT DONE?
ABSTAIN THOU IF ’TIS EVIL; PERSEVERE IF GOOD.
MEDITATE UPON MY COUNSELS; LOVE THEM, FOLLOW THEM: TO THE DIVINE VIRTUES WILL THEY KNOW HOW TO LEAD THEE.
I SWEAR IT BY THE ONE WHO IN OUR HEARTS ENGRAVED THE SACRED TETRAD, SYMBOL IMMENSE AND PURE, SOURCE OF NATURE AND MODEL OF THE GODS.</description>

‌CHAPTER 7
A Bold Experiment
6 January 1979 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1
WHAT IS FAITH? ALSO, HERMAN HESSE HAS SAID, ‘FAITH AND DOUBT BELONG TOGETHER AND GOVERN EACH OTHER LIKE INHALING AND EXHALING.’ CAN YOU PLEASE COMMENT?
Deva Vinaya,
FAITH CAN HAVE THREE MEANINGS. First is belief – belief is a lie, it is insincere, dishonest. To believe something means you don’t know it and yet you believe.</description>

‌CHAPTER 8
Escape to Reality
7 January 1979 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1
WHAT DOES YOUR MOVEMENT SIGNIFY ABOUT THE CONDITION OF SOCIETY? IS IT AN ESCAPIST AND SELF-REGARDING CULT? OR DO VOU PROPOSE THROUGH CHANGING HUMAN NATURE TO CHANGE SOCIETY AND THE wORLD?
Peter Jenkins,
WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE IS NOT A movement: it is a mutation. It has no concern with the society: its whole concern is with the individual.</description>

‌CHAPTER 9
There’s No God Till You’ve Met Him
8 January 1979 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1
OSHO, IS NO-MIND THE ULTIMATE PRAYER?
Prabuddha,
PRAYER IS NOT SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DONE. Prayer is not something that can be thought either. Prayer is a state of silent being, of utter silence. One simply is... then one is in prayer. If you do prayer, you miss the whole point.</description>

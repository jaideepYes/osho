It is incalculable.\nFor the first time he introduced vegetarianism to the West. The idea of vegetarianism is of immense value; it is based on great reverence for life.\nThe modern mind can understand it far better now we know that all forms of life are interrelated, interdependent. Man is not an island: man exists in an infinite web of millions of forms of life and existence. We exist in a chain, we are not separate. And to destroy other animals is not only ugly, unaesthetic, inhuman – it is also unscientific. We are destroying our own foundation.\nLife exists as one organic unity. Man can exist only as part of this orchestra. Just think of man without birds and without animals and without fish – that life will be very very boring; it will lose all complexity, variety, richness, colour. The forests will be utterly empty, the cuckoo will not call, and the birds will not fly, and the water will look very sad without the fish.\nLife in its infinite forms exists as one organic unity. We are part of it: the part should feel reverence for the whole. That is the idea of vegetarianism. It simply means: don’t destroy life. It simply means: life is God – avoid destroying it, otherwise you will be destroying the very ecology.\nAnd it has something very scientific behind it. It was not an accident that all the religions that were born in India are basically vegetarian, and all the religions that were born outside India are non- vegetarian. But the highest peaks of religious consciousness were known in India and nowhere else.\nVegetarianism functioned as a purification. When you eat animals you are more under the law of necessity. You are heavy, you gravitate more towards the earth. When you are a vegetarian you are light and you are more under the law of grace, under the law of power, and you start gravitating towards the sky.\nYour food is not just food: it is you. What you eat, you become. If you eat something which is fundamentally based on murder, on violence, you cannot rise above the law of necessity. You will remain more or less an animal. The human is born when you start moving above the animals, when you start doing something to yourself which no animal can do.\nVegetarianism is a conscious effort, a deliberate effort, to get out of the heaviness that keeps you tethered to the earth so that you can fly – so that the flight from the alone to the alone becomes possible.\nThe lighter the food, the deeper goes the meditation. The grosser the food. then meditation becomes more and more difficult. I am not saying that meditation is impossible for a non-vegetarian – it is not impossible, but it is unnecessarily difficult.\nIt is like a man who is going to climb a mountain, and he goes on carrying many rocks. It is possible that even when you are carrying rocks you may reach to the mountain peak, but it creates unnecessary trouble. You could have thrown those rocks, you could have unburdened yourself, and the climb would have been easier, far more pleasant.\nThe intelligent person will not carry rocks when he is going to the mountain, will not carry anything unnecessary. And the higher he moves, the lighter and lighter he will become. Even if he is carrying something, he will drop it.\nWhen Edmund Hillary and Tenzing reached Everest for the first time, they had to drop everything on the way – because the higher they moved, the more difficult it was to carry anything. Even very essential things were dropped. Just to carry yourself is more than enough.\nVegetarianism is of immense help. It changes your chemistry. When you eat and live on animals.… The first thing: whenever an animal is killed the animal is angry, afraid – naturally. When you kill an animal... just think of yourself being killed. What will be the state of your consciousness? What will be your psychology? All kinds of poisons will be released in your body, because when you are angry a certain kind of poison is released into your blood. When you are afraid, again a certain other kind of poison is released into your blood. And when you are being killed, that is the utmost in fear, anger. All the glands in your body release all their poison.\nAnd man goes on living on that poisoned meat. If it keeps you angry, violent, aggressive, it is not strange; it is natural. Whenever you live on killing, you don’t have any respect for life; you are inimical to life. And the person who is inimical to life cannot move into prayer – because prayer means reverence for life.\nAnd one who is inimical to God’s creatures cannot be very friendly towards God either. If you destroy Picasso’s paintings, you cannot be very respectful towards Picasso – it is impossible. All the creatures belong to God. God lives in them, God breathes in them, they are HIS manifestation, just as you are. They are brothers and sisters.\nWhen you see an animal if the idea of brotherhood does not arise in you, you don’t know what prayer is, you will never know what prayer is. And the very idea that just for food, just for taste, you can destroy life, is so ugly. It is impossible to believe that man goes on doing it.\nPythagoras was the first to introduce vegetarianism to the West. It is of profound depth for man to learn how to live in friendship with nature, in friendship with creatures. That becomes the foundation. And only on that foundation can you base your prayer, your meditativeness. You can watch it in yourself: when you eat meat, meditation will be found to be more and more difficult.\nBuddha was born in a non-vegetarian family. He was a KSHATRIYA – belonged to the warrior race – but the experience of meditation slowly slowly transformed him into a vegetarian. It was his inner understanding: whenever he ate meat, meditation was more difficult; whenever he avoided meat, meditation was easier. It was just a simple observation.\nYou will be surprised to know that the greatest vegetarians in the world have been Jainas – but all their twenty-four Masters were born into families of non-vegetarians. They were all warriors; they were brought up as fighters. All the twenty-four Masters of the Jainas were KSHATRIYAS.\nWhat happened? Why did these people who were brought up, conditioned from their very beginning to eat meat, create one day the greatest movement in the world for vegetarianism? Just because of their experiments with meditation.\nIt is an unavoidable fact that if you want to meditate, if you want to become thoughtless, if you want to become light – so light that the earth cannot pull you downwards, so light that you start levitating, so light that the sky becomes available to you – then you have to move from non-vegetarian conditioning to the freedom of vegetarianism.\nVegetarianism has nothing to do with religion: it is something basically scientific. It has nothing to do with morality, but it has much to do with aesthetics. It is unbelievable that a man of sensitivity, awareness, understanding, love, can eat meat. And if he can eat meat then something is missing he is still unconscious somewhere of what he is doing, unconscious of the implications of his acts.\nBut Pythagoras was not heard, not believed – on the contrary, he was ridiculed, persecuted. And he had brought one of the greatest treasures from the East to the West. He had brought a great experiment – if he had been heard, the West would have been a totally different world.\nThe problem that has arisen today, that we have destroyed nature, would never have arisen. If Pythagoras had become the foundation for the Western consciousness, there would not have been these great World Wars. He would have changed the whole course of history. He tried hard, he did whatsoever HE could – it is not his fault. But people are blind, people are deaf; they can’t hear a thing, they can’t understand a thing. And they are not ready to change their habits.\nPeople live in their habits, mechanically they live. And he had brought a message of becoming aware. Great meditative energy would have been released in the West. It would have become impossible to produce Adolf Hitlers and Mussolinis and Stalins. It would have been a totally different world. But still the same old habit persists.\nWe cannot change human consciousness unless we start by changing the human body. When you eat meat you are absorbing the animal in you – and the animal has to be transcended. Avoid! If you really want to go higher and higher, if you really want to go to the sunlit peaks of your consciousness, if you really want to know God, then you will have to change in every possible way.\nYou will have to look all around your life. you will have to observe each small habit in detail – because sometimes a VERY small thing can change your whole life. Sometimes it may be a very SIMPLE thing, and it can change your life SO totally that it looks almost unbelievable.\nTry vegetarianism and you will be surprised: meditation becomes far easier. Love becomes more subtle, loses its grossness – becomes more sensitive but less sensuous, becomes more prayerful and less sexual. And your body also starts taking on a different vibe. You become more graceful, softer, more feminine, less aggressive, more receptive.\nVegetarianism is an alchemical change in you. It creates the space in which the baser metal can be transformed into gold.\nTHE SECOND THING that Pythagoras also introduced into Western consciousness was the idea of reincarnation. That too is somehow related with vegetarianism. You will be surprised again: all the vegetarian religions believe in reincarnation, and all the non-vegetarian religions believe only in one life. This can’t be just a coincidence.\nIn India, Brahminism, Jainism, Buddhism are the three great religions. They differ in every possible way – their ideologies are so different that you cannot find more different ideologies anywhere. Hindus believe in God, they believe in the soul. Jainas don’t believe in God – a tremendously fundamental thing – a religion without God. Buddhists don’t even believe in the soul – no God, no soul. You cannot imagine a religion without God and without the soul. Such are their differences.\nBut about one thing they are all agreed, and that one thing is the idea of reincarnation, rebirth. Even Buddha, who does not believe in the soul, agrees with it. It looks very absurd – how can there be rebirth if there is no soul? He does not believe in a soul but he believes in a continuum. He says: Just as you light a candle in the evening in the morning when you are blowing it out can you say it is the same flame that you had started in the evening? It is not the same – and YET somehow it is connected. The flame has been changing the whole night. the flame was disappearing the whole night – it was disappearing into smoke and a new flame was replacing it each moment. In fact the movement was so quick, that’s why you couldn’t see the gaps. There has been a continuum – a constant change, but very quick and fast – one flame being replaced by another, the whole night.\nSo when in the morning you are putting the candle out, it is not the same flame that you had started – although it looks almost the same. The first flame and the last ARE connected – they are part of one chain, one process – but you cannot say that there has been one flame, one soul.\nThat is the Buddhist idea of reincarnation: the continuity continues but individuals disappear – there is no individual soul. But still Buddha believed in reincarnation. Jainas believe in reincarnation, Brahmins believe in reincarnation.\nBut Jews, Christians and Mohammedans don’t believe. Those are the three great religions which were born outside India. How did it happen that all three Indian religions stumbled upon the fact of reincarnation? – although they don’t agree in ANY other matter. Why do they agree about one thing? They COULD not disagree. From where did this experience come to them?\nAnd you will be surprised – the answer is vegetarianism.\nWhen a person is utterly vegetarian he can easily remember his past lives. His clarity is such that he can look into his past lives. He is not gross, his energy is not blocked, his energy moves easily. His river of consciousness can penetrate to the ancientmost times; he can go backwards as much as he wants.\nThe consciousness of a non-vegetarian is blocked – in many ways. He has been accumulating gross matter in himself. That gross matter functions as a barrier. That’s why all the three religions that were born outside India, and have remained non-vegetarian, could not come to the idea of reincarnation. They could not experience it.\nPythagoras lived in India, lived the life of a vegetarian, meditated deeply, became aware of the past lives, could see himself moving backwards. He could understand what Buddha means when he says, “Once I was an elephant, once I was a fish, once I was a tree.”\nThe idea of evolution has been here in the East for ever – and in a far more subtle way than it has been given to Western science by Darwin. Darwin’s idea is very raw: he says monkeys have become man – although Darwinians have not yet been able to prove it, because they are still searching for the link between the monkey and the man. And the problem arises: why did only a few monkeys become men? What happened to other monkeys? And monkeys are basically imitators – if a few monkeys had become men then all the monkeys would have imitated. What happened to the other monkeys? Great imitators they are – why only a few men?\nAnd the monkeys are still there! Thousands and thousands of years have passed and monkeys are still monkeys. And you don’t come across a monkey suddenly becoming a man... one fine morning he wakes up and he is a man. Nobody has ever seen this miracle happen.\nThe question is: where are the links between monkey and man? – and the difference is great, it is not small.\nJust the other day somebody asked, John Lilly has said that man is not the only being on the earth who has consciousness; there are other beings too who have more consciousness than man.” The questioner has asked, “Is it true? Is John Lilly right?”\nBut those other animals have not discovered man yet – it is John Lilly who discovers those other animals. It is man who goes on discovering. Certainly the discoverer has more consciousness than the discovered. Even if we find some day that some animal has a great, evolved brain, WE are the discoverers. That great brain has not discovered us just.\nThere are animals who are very evolved, but nobody is as evolved as man. And the difference is big! John Lilly has been working on dolphins, and he thinks that dolphins have a far better evolved consciousness. If you just meet John Lilly some time, tell him that dolphins have not discovered him – he has discovered dolphins. And the discoverer has more consciousness, obviously.\nDolphins are not saying anything about themselves – it is a man who is saying something about dolphins. They cannot even prove something about themselves. Dolphins are beautiful people, and Lilly is on the right track, but dolphins don’t have a higher consciousness than man. They have not produced Buddhas, Patanjalis, Pythagorases – not even a John Lilly.\nThe Western concept of evolution, the Darwinian concept of evolution, is very gross. The Eastern idea of evolution is very subtle. It is not a question of the body of a monkey becoming the body of man – it has never happened; of the body of a fish becoming the body of man – it has never happened. But the inside of the fish goes on growing; it goes on changing from one body to another.\nThe growth, the evolution, has not happened from body to body: the growth has been happening in consciousness. When a monkey attains to a certain consciousness, the next birth will be that of man not of a monkey. He will die as a monkey and will be born as a man. The evolution is not going to happen in the body of the monkey itself. That body has been used by the soul – or whatever you call it, the continuum – the body of the monkey has been used, now the soul is ready to take a better body, a body where more possibilities of growth will become available.\nThe soul moves from one animal to another animal. The bodies are not evolving, but souls are evolving. The candles are not evolving, but the flames go on jumping from one candle to another. The flame goes on rising higher and higher. The evolution is of consciousness, not of the material, physiological body. That is where Darwin missed the whole point.\nBut in the East for at least ten thousand years we have been aware of it. The awareness came through meditation and the awareness was based in vegetarianism – because people started remembering their past lives.\nIt was a basic technique with both Buddha and Mahavira: whenever a disciple was to be initiated, the first thing that both Buddha and Mahavira required was that he had to go into his past lives. Great methods were developed so that one could move into past lives.\nAnd once you start moving into past lives, this life will be utterly transformed. Why? Because once you see that all the stupid things that you are doing now, or wanting to do, you have been doing for many many lives... you have done those same things many times, and each time nothing was attained.\nFor example, if you are mad after money and then you remember that in the past life also you were mad after money and then you had succeeded, and you had become a rich man, a very rich man, and then you died... and all that richness and all that wealth was of no use. It was taken away by death, and you died as empty as ever, as poor as ever. And you remember even before that: you were a king and you had a great kingdom. And still you were frustrated, and still you lived in misery, and you died in misery. And again you are doing the same and hankering for more money? It will become impossible. The longing will simply fall flat on the ground. How can you go on repeating the same stupid thing again and again if YOU CAN REMEMBER? YOU can go on repeating the same stupidity again and again if you CANNOT remember.\nThe idea of reincarnation is not a philosophical idea: it is an experience, it is utterly scientific. People have remembered their lives.\nWhen you have grown a little deeper into meditation... we are going to do all those techniques here too. But those techniques will require that you be absolutely vegetarian, otherwise you will not be able to go beyond THIS life. Your mind cannot move – it has to be so light, featherlight, that it can simply pass from one existence into another. And the lighter it is, the deeper it goes.\nIt can not only remember that you were a man in the past life – slowly slowly, you will remember that you have been animals. AND, sometimes, when the depth gross, you will remember that you have been trees, rocks. You have lived for millennia in many forms. And if you remember that once you were a fish, it will become difficult for you to eat fish.\nVegetarianism leads you into remembering your past lives. And KNOWING your past lives, you become more and more a vegetarian – because seeing that all are brothers and sisters, the whole existence, you cannot kill animals. It becomes simply impossible! Not that you have to prevent yourself: it simply becomes impossible.\nPythagoras was a REAL adventurer. Alexander the Great also came to India, he also took away many things from India, but they were useless things – diamonds and emeralds and gold. That’s what Alexander the Great took away from India – useless things. Pythagoras was a real seeker. He gathered real diamonds, real emeralds: diamonds of consciousness, emeralds of consciousness. And these were two tremendously significant, tremendously pregnant approaches – that of vegetarianism and the idea of reincarnation.\nOnce it happened: Pythagoras saw somebody hitting a dog. He said, “Do not hit him!” to the man who was beating the dog. “It is the soul of a friend of mine. I recognized it when I heard it cry out.”\nNow this looks utterly ridiculous to a Western mind, to the Western scientific attitude. Even in those old days, people must have laughed: “What nonsense he is talking about! – ‘Don’t beat the dog because I have recognized a friend.’” He was simply trying to teach the idea of reincarnation in every way possible.\nAnd the third thing: he was, again, the first to introduce the concept that life is a wheel – a wheel of birth and death. The wheel goes on moving and we go on clinging to the wheel. And the wheel is repetitive; again and again it will move on the same track. Nothing new will ever happen. Birth will come, you will become young, you will be full of sex and great desires, and then you will be spent and you will be old, diseased, ill sick, frustrated, tired. And then death... and again birth... and so on and so forth.\nEach birth brings a death, each death brings a birth. It is a vicious circle, and the wheel goes on moving. In India the word for the world is SAMSARA. SAMSARA means ‘the wheel’. Youth or childhood or old age are just spokes of the wheel. and we go on clinging to the wheel and the wheel goes on moving – as everything else moves in the world. The earth moves around the sun, and the sun also moves around some unknown sun. And the moon moves around the earth, and earth and moon both move around the sun, and the sun around some other sun, and so on and so forth. And all the stars are moving.And EVERYTHING IS moving in a circle! Seasons move in a circle.\nLife is a wheel and the wheel is repetitive. You will never reach anywhere if you go on clinging to the wheel. In the East it has been a known fact that we have to jump out of the wheel – only then are we free. To be free from this wheel of birth and death is to have freedom. Then you simply ARE. Then you are not moving.Then there is no past and no future but only the present. Then NOW IS the only time and here the only space.\nThat is the state of nirvana, MOKSHA – freedom. That is the real kingdom of God. One simply is... all turmoil gone, all storms finished, and there is absolute silence. In that silence there is a song, in that silence there is music – unheard music, unstruck music. In that silence is joy, in that silence is bliss. And that bliss is eternal, it never changes.\nAll change is if you are clinging to the wheel. If you drop out of the wheel, all change disappears. Then you are here and always here.\nThat state is the real search of all true seekers: how to get out of this wheel of birth and death, how to enter into life eternal where no birth ever happens and no death either, where nothing begins and nothing ends, where all simply is – how to enter into this God. Just the other day, I was saying God means ‘that which is’... how to enter into that which is? These are the sutras by which to enter into that which is.\nThe third part: perfection.\nLET NOT SLEEP EVER CLOSE THY TIRED EYES WITHOUT THOU ASK THYSELF. WHAT HAVE I OMITTED AND WHAT DONE?\nON THE SURFACE it will appear a very simple, moralistic sutra. It is not. It has something tremendously meaningful – it has the whole idea of depth psychology in it. But the language is\ntwenty-five centuries old. Now modern therapies say that if any experience remains incomplete then it becomes a hangover. This is a new insight in modern psychology, but it is nothing new as far as Eastern psychology is concerned.\nIf you live some experience totally, you are finished with it – it never accumulates in you. If you live it only half then the unlived part goes on hankering to be lived. The whole of psychoanalysis, psychodrama, primal therapy, is based on this idea.\nWhat is psychotherapy? Basically, helping you so that you can live unlived experiences of the past, or half-lived experiences of the past, again. Creating a context in which you can again live those moments which have remained incomplete. Once they are complete, once you can put a full point to them, they are finished, you are free of them.\nRemember, this as a VERY fundamental law: any experience that is complete, you are finished with it. It leaves no karma, it creates no karma. It creates no trace, it leaves no trace in you – not even footprints. Nothing is left of it. It simply disappears, evaporates.\nIf you have loved a woman totally, wholly, and the woman dies, you will be surprised – yes, it feels a little sad, but you are not going crazy or anything. You are not beating your chest and crying and shouting, “I will kill myself. I cannot live any more.” If you have loved the woman totally and she dies, yes, a sadness... but that sadness is beautiful – it is just a silent goodbye. But you will not commit suicide, and you will not cry and weep for months and years. Maybe a few tears, but those tears will not be of misery and suffering – on the contrary, they will be of gratefulness, of thankfulness.\nYou are thankful to the woman – she had given you much. She had made you a grown-up person; she had showered much love on you. And you are not feeling guilty, because you have given all that you could.\nIf you have not loved the woman totally, then you will feel guilty. And out of guilt, suffering. And then you will move to the other extreme: you will cry and weep and you will not eat any food and you will be miserable for months, for years, even for your whole life – because deep down, now you are repenting. The woman is gone, and you never loved her. And now there is no possibility of ever seeing her again. You cannot have any opportunity even to apologize. You cannot say to her, “Forgive me. I have not loved you as I should have loved you.” Now that incomplete experience will hover around you like a dark cloud.\nIn psychodrama you will live that experience again, you will create the fantasy again. And once you can create that fantasy again – even if in your imagination – or you can act the same thing again believing some other woman to be that woman, if you can enact the whole act again, if you can go through the drama of it, you will be relieved. There will come a full point. You will be released from the cage.\nThat’s what happens in primal therapy. You have to live the birth trauma again. And once you have lived the birth trauma again, something, a heavy weight from your chest, disappears.\nAnd that’s what happens in psychoanalysis. You have to say to the psychoanalyst all that is clamouring inside you – sense, nonsense, relevant, irrelevant, consistent, inconsistent – all the\ncrazy things that are clamouring there asking for your attention. But you don’t have any time, and nobody else has time enough to hear you, to listen to you.\nPsychoanalysis is a simple thing; it is more a trick than a treatment. The psychoanalyst does nothing; he simply sits behind the couch. He may not even be listening to you – how can one go on listening to every kind of madness every day? One has to protect one’s own sanity too. He may be having his own fantasies – because he has as much nonsense in him as you do. He has to live his own nonsense.\nBut you feel that he is listening to you, so you can pour your heart out. And just by pouring your heart out, something is released – it is a catharsis.\nPythagoras is using a very ancient dictum, simple. Why wait for the psychoanalyst and why wait for something like psychodrama or primal therapy? Why not go on finishing every experience every day?\nIn the night, before going to sleep, just look back. Those twelve hours that you have lived, finish everything. It is easier – rather than accumulating for years and then going to a therapist, why not be a therapist to your own self? And it is so easy to do it every day. It is not a big problem, only a small accumulation – it can be finished.\nLET NOT SLEEP EVER CLOSE THY TIRED EYES WITHOUT THOU ASK THYSELF. WHAT HAVE I OMITTED AND WHAT DONE?\n“What have I done and what have I not done?” Just go through it: let there be a deep meditation of all that you have done today. Slowly slowly, live again from the morning; just start from the morning again, the first moment when you had opened your eyes, remember those moments – not only remember: RELIVE.’ those first moments when you had opened your eyes. The birds were singing outside, the sun had risen – listen to those birds again. And the rays of the early morning sun were coming through the curtain, and the curtain was looking so golden... just relive it. And your wife was preparing tea in the kitchen, and the children were getting ready to go to school – just remember, relive, from the moment.\nAnd then go on slowly, very meditatively, seeing what you have done in the whole day, and what you have not done. What has remained undone? What has remained incomplete? At least in your imagination, complete it! If you have done something wrong, at least in your imagination put it right. If you have missed and omitted something, at least in your imagination complete it. And you will be surprised – you will never need any therapy, because every day you will be finished with all the dust. Things will be put right.\nACCORDING TO PORPHYRY, two lines are missing in THE GOLDEN VERSES here, which ought to be placed preceding this sutra. My feeling also is that those two lines ARE missing. Those two lines are:\nON THE MOMENT OF AWAKENING, CONSIDER CALMLY WHAT ARE THY DUTIES, AND WHAT THOU SHOULDST ACCOMPLISH.\n[Here is printed the Greek text]\nIt seems those two lines MUST have been there – somewhere they must be lost – because if it is good to contemplate in the night, just to look backwards at what you have done and what you have not done, then the other part is also significant. It is the other aspect of the same coin.\nEarly in the morning, when everything is fresh, and the whole night’s sleep has rejuvenated you, when the mind has not entered yet... have you watched? It takes a few seconds for the mind to start functioning. Immediately you become aware that you are awake, just look in: everything is silent. Within seconds, two or three seconds, the mind will be awake and will start working. Before that happens, in that moment of silence, in that meditative moment, it is good to have a vision of the day that you are going to live.\nON THE MOMENT OF AWAKENING...\nIt has to be done IMMEDIATELY! If you lose a few moments it is gone. In the very moment of awakening you are a mirror. Just let the mirror see the whole day that is ahead.\n... CONSIDER CALMLY WHAT ARE THY DUTIES, AND WHAT THOU SHOULDST ACCOMPLISH.\nJust let a simple seed fall into your heart. It is not planning, remember – don’t misunderstand Pythagoras. It is not planning: it is just a simple seed falling into the heart that “This is my vision for today.” And that seed will affect your whole day’s activities, your quality.\nAnd in the night again remember the vision, and remember what has been accomplished, what has not been accomplished – relive it. The circle is complete. And every day, living this way, you will not need any therapy ever.\nABSTAIN THOU IF IT IS EVIL; PERSEVERE IF GOOD.\nIf in the night meditating, reliving the whole day, you find something is evil, abstain from it, don’t go on repeating it. And if something is good, persevere. And what is evil according to Pythagoras and according to me and according to all the Buddhas? Anything that needs unconsciousness for it to be done is evil; anything that cannot be done without unconsciousness is evil. And anything that needs consciousness for it to be done is good; anything which cannot be done without consciousness is good. So, looking back, see what you have done the whole day: when you were aware and when you were unaware; when you functioned like a machine, like a robot, and when you functioned as a consciousness. And whenever you functioned as a consciousness, you were doing something good.\nYou will be surprised to know that whenever you function as consciousness, good happens of its own accord. And whenever you function as unconsciousness, something goes wrong. Unconsciousness is evil: consciousness is virtue.\nMEDITATE UPON MY COUNSELS, LOVE THEM, FOLLOW THEM, TO THE DIVINE VIRTUES WILL THEY KNOW HOW TO LEAD THEE.\nMEDITATE UPON MY COUNSELS...\nHE IS NOT SAYING BELIEVE – he says meditate. He says: Become a mirror to whatsoever I am saying. And he does not say that these are commandments but only counsels. He is not saying that you HAVE to do it: these are not orders – these are simple counsels, a helping hand from a friend who wishes only blessings for you.\nMEDITATE UPON MY COUNSELS...\n... just listen silently, without prejudice. Don’t be in a hurry to decide what is right and what is wrong. Just let it sink deep in you; watchful witnessing, let it penetrate your heart. That is meditation.\nListen meditatively to MY COUNSELS, LOVE THEM...\nLove arises spontaneously if you can meditate. If you cannot meditate, then logic arises spontaneously. These are the two outcomes. How you listen, everything depends on that.\nFor example, you are listening to me. Those who have fallen en rapport with me, they are listening in a totally different way – they are meditating, they are utterly silent. They are simply drinking whatsoever I am saying to them. They know I am their friend; they know that whatsoever I am saying is not a commandment but only a counsel, only advice.\nIf you meditate on what I am saying then love will arise in you. And if you argue with me, don’t meditate with me – you listen there with all your prejudices, with your ideology, with your scriptures, with your whole past shouting inside you – if you are comparing, judging, criticizing, arguing, then logic will arise in you.\nLogic arises only when you listen with prejudice, when you are not really listening but arguing, when you are really defending, afraid, fighting . So what arises in you will decide whether it was meditatively listened to or not. Let this be the criterion: if love arises that means you have listened rightly; if logic arises that means you missed the point – you listened to the words but you missed the silence. You understood only intellectually, but your heart remained unmoved; you didn’t allow your heart to move.\nMEDITATE UPON MY COUNSELS, LOVE THEM...\nMeditation is the base, then love comes on its own. And if love comes, follow them. It will not be a question of imitation, it will not be a question of believing. Your very love will make you capable of acting accordingly. A commandment has to be followed forcibly; you have to enforce it upon yourself. A counsel is not to be enforced: you heard it, you loved it; now, on your own, you start acting, you start functioning. The act grows out of love just as love grows out of meditation. Meditation is the root, love is the tree, and following is the flowering.\nTO THE DIVINE VIRTUES WILL THEY KNOW HOW TO LEAD THEE.\nAnd then you need not be worried: divine virtues will arise in you as a gift from God. One virtue is human, one is divine. The human virtue is that which you have to force upon yourself; it is man- made. The divine virtue is that which is a gift from the unknown, a gift from the beyond, a nod, a yes, from the beyond.\nIf you do these three things with a Master – meditating, loving, following – that’s enough. These will take you to the very source of divine virtues. Then a person becomes virtuous but never becomes righteous.Then a person becomes a sage but never becomes a saint. Then a person becomes so religious that he is neither Mohammedan nor Hindu nor Christian – he is simply religious. Then a person lives in God and God lives through him: he becomes a vehicle, he becomes a hollow bamboo, and God starts singing through him.\nI SWEAR IT BY THE ONE WHO IN OUR HEARTS ENGRAVED THE SACRED TETRAD, SYMBOL IMMENSE AND PURE, SOURCE OF NATURE AND MODEL OF THE GODS.\nTHE SACRED TETRAD HAS TO BE UNDERSTOOD. It means number four. Three dimensions are of God AS manifestation, and there is a fourth dimension – God as unmanifest. Three dimensions are visible, the fourth dimension is invisible. All these four dimensions make the sacred Tetrad. If you have read P. D. Ouspensky’s great book, THE FOURTH WAY, you will understand what the Tetrad is.\nGurdjieff used to say that his way is the fourth way. There are four possibilities because there are four dimensions. The first is the physical possibility, hatha yoga, the way of the fakir – yoga postures, standing on your head, distorting, contorting your body – that is the lowest and the ugliest, the most gross and materialistic way. It leads up to a certain extent.\nThe second way is that of the mind, the way that is followed by all psychotherapies. Better than the first, but still something of the manifest, still gross – subtler than the first, but still gross.\nThe third is the way of the soul – followed by religions, philosophies. That seems to be the highest possibility ordinarily. But there is one more, the fourth way.\nThe third way seems to be the highest as far as manifestation is concerned, but there is a fourth – which contains all and yet is beyond. Gurdjieff says: “My way is the fourth way.”\nPatanjali says also that there are four states of consciousness: the waking, JAGRAT; the dreaming, SWAPNA; the sleeping, SUSHUPTI; AND the fourth... for the fourth he gives no name – he simply calls it TURIYA; TURIYA means the fourth. TURIYA is exactly the meaning of Tetrad – the fourth. And the fourth means absolute awakening, pure awakening.\nWhat we know as awakening is not much of an awakening. In the morning you wake up, but you simply wake up from one dream into another dream; you wake up from the private dream into the collective dream, that’s all. You get out from a small prison into a bigger prison, that’s all. It is not much of an awakening – because the same desires persist and the same illusions persist and the same state of mind remains.\nYour awakening is not real awakening; it is pseudo. The real awakening happens only in the fourth – where all dreams have disappeared, the whole world that you had known in your waking has disappeared, is no more known, that which you had known in your dreams is no more known. That which you had known even in your deep sleep, that joy of deep sleep, that silence, that rejuvenating energy of deep sleep, even that is gone. Now you have arrived at the very source, but that source is unmanifest, it is invisible. That invisible source is God.\nPythagoras says:\nI SWEAR IT BY THE ONE WHO IN OUR HEARTS ENGRAVED THE SACRED TETRAD, SYMBOL IMMENSE AND PURE, SOURCE OF NATURE AND MODEL OF THE GODS.\nIf you can know the fourth, you will have known the very model of God, you will have known the very source of nature, you will have known TAO, DHAMMA, LOGOS. You will have known from where everything comes and to where everything goes – the source and the goal, the alpha and the omega.\nBUT BEFORE ALL, THY SOUL TO ITS FAITHFUL DUTY, INVOKE THESE GODS WITH FERVOUR, THEY WHOSE AID, THY WORK BEGUN, ALONE CAN TERMINATE.\nPythagoras says: Before you enter into the world of the fourth, the invisible, and before you start moving on this inner pilgrimage of perfection, the first thing is: ask the hell of the Gods. It is just all expression for asking the existence to help you, asking the whole to be friendly to your efforts. In essence, it means prayer.\nHave you heard it or not? that many experiments have been done around the world in which a religious person prays, and with prayerful hands, when he is vibrating with the prayer, he touches water – that water is showered on a particular plant. The same water untouched by the prayerful hands, is showered on another plant – both of the same age, but the one which receives the water touched by prayerful hands grows faster. Within weeks it is double the size of the other one which has received simple water exactly the same, only one thing missing – the vibe of the prayerful hands.And the plant that has been blessed by prayerful hands brings bigger fruits, bigger flowers, and sooner than the other. The flowers have more fragrance than the other, and the fruits are more juicy than the other.\nThis has been repeated now, and now it is almost a scientific thing; it cannot be denied any more. Of course, how it works nobody knows. Why does prayer help so much? For example, if somebody has a headache and you are giving a massage, it is better first to pray and let your hands vibrate with prayer, and then massage. And you will see a tremendous change – your hands will be so powerful.\nExistence can help you if you ask – it only helps you if you ask. If you don’t ask, it remains aloof, it does not interfere. But if you ask, if you open up, existence starts pouring into you. And then the part has as much energy as the whole. It depends on how much you open up: if you open up totally, then the part is the whole, then a man is as magical as the whole.\nThat is the whole secret of prayer: asking help from existence. And you are going on a really dangerous journey, hazardous; there are many pitfalls. And the higher you move, the more hazardous the journey becomes, because if you fall... you will be lost for ever.\nBUT BEFORE ALL, THY SOUL TO ITS FAITHFUL DUTY, INVOKE THESE GODS WITH FERVOUR, THEY WHOSE AID, THY WORK BEGUN, ALONE CAN TERMINATE.\nYou cannot reach the goal alone. You can reach the goal only with the help of the whole. That is the scientific meaning of prayer: invoking the whole, asking the whole that “I am going on a long\njourney – please be with me.” And slowly slowly you will see that a great energy follows you. And slowly slowly you will become aware that you need not do much: all that you need to do is to relax and absorb the energy that follows you.\nPrayer is the greatest power there is, because prayer makes the part function as a whole.\nINSTRUCTED BY THEM, NAUGHT SHALL THEN DECEIVE THEE: OF DIVERSE BEINGS THOU SHALT SOUND THE ESSENCE, AND THOU SHALT KNOW THE PRINCIPLE AND END OF ALL.\nINSTRUCTED BY THEM...\nAnd if you become available in prayer to the whole, you will start hearing the still small voice within you – that is instruction from God.\nFirst meditate upon the counsels of your Master, love them, follow them, then you have become capable of taking a plunge into prayer. The Master is visible, God is invisible. You have learnt how to participate in the being of the Master, now learn how to participate in the invisible being of God who is the source of all and the end of all. That is prayer. And in prayer you will start hearing a still small voice within you.\nOnce that voice is clearly heard and understood, you need not depend on the outer Master, you have found the inner Master. And you will be surprised to see that the counsels from the outer Master and the instructions from the inner voice are exactly the same. Your inner voice is only represented by the outer Master. The outer Master has nothing to say of his own accord: he simply looks into you, he simply finds your own heart, and speaks for your inner heart.\nThat’s why you will find so many inconsistencies in a Master’s statements – because to one disciple he will say one thing, to another disciple he will say something else. Because he is not there just dishing out ready-made formulas – he is there to listen to your inner voice. He has just to reflect you; he has to make your inner Master available to you. You cannot yet directly contact the inner Master, hence the outer Master is needed. But he is not to interfere. If he interferes, he is not a Master at all. He simply interprets, he simply communicates, your own inner voice to you because you yourself are not yet capable of taking that plunge. Once you have started listening to the inner instruction, nothing can ever deceive you. Then the whole life is reflected so clearly that nothing can ever deceive you.\nOF DIVERSE BEINGS THOU SHALT SOUND THE ESSENCE...\nAnd whosoever comes in front of you, you will sound his essence, you will know who he is, for what he is there, what his designs are, what his strategies are, what games he wants to play. Before he appears you will know... NAUGHT CAN DECEIVE THEE.\nAND THOU SHALT KNOW THE PRINCIPLE AND END OF ALL.\nIF HEAVEN WILLS IT, THOU SHALT KNOW THAT NATURE, ALIKE IN EVERYTHING, IS THE SAME IN EVERY PLACE:\nListen carefully:\nIF HEAVEN WILLS IT...\nNOW YOU HAVE COME TO A POINT where ego has to be utterly dropped. Preparing, the ego was there. Purifying, the ego was there. But now when you are moving into the dimension of perfection, ego has to be utterly dropped – no effort is even to be thought of of your own accord.\nIF HEAVEN WILLS IT...\nNow everything is God’s will: Thy kingdom come, thy will be done. Now you have to relax totally into the whole.\nIF HEAVEN WILLS IT THOU SHALT KNOW THAT NATURE.. .\nYou will come to know truth only if God wills it. You relax, you wait in deep relaxation, you be patient. And once heaven wills it... and it is BOUND to happen, the grace is bound to happen, only you have to disappear. And in relaxing totally you disappear, you become just an empty waiting, an empty vessel, a womb. And, IMMEDIATELY, whenever your inner emptiness is absolute, God descends in you, and the whole mystery is revealed to you. Then you will see all:\nALIKE IN EVERYTHING...\nGod is in everything.\n... IS THE SAME IN EVERY PLACE:\nOnly God is, and nothing else. Only God exists. God is synonymous with existence.\nSO THAT, AS TO THY TRUE RIGHTS ENLIGHTENED, THINE HEART SHALL NO MORE FEED ON VAIN DESIRES.\nNow, when grace has arrived, only then will you know you were unnecessarily begging, desiring. All the treasures are yours, the whole kingdom is yours, the whole universe belongs to you. All the joys and all the blessings are yours.\nSO THAT, AS TO THY TRUE RIGHTS ENLIGHTENED...\nBut this will happen only when you have become utterly enlightened. And what is enlightenment? The ego gone and God has appeared in you – that is enlightenment. The ego is darkness, God is light.\n... TO THY TRUE RIGHTS ENLIGHTENED...\nAnd this is your right! your birthright – to become enlightened. Never be contented with less than that. It HAS to be achieved because you are MEANT to achieve it. You have to become it! because in the first place you ARE it...\nTHOU SHALT SEE THAT THE EVILS WHICH DEVOUR MEN.\nARE OF THEIR CHOICE THE FRUIT...\nAnd now you will see two things. One: desiring is meaningless because all is given without even asking for it. All is being given as a gift! You need not be a beggar: you are all emperors! The kingdom of God is your own kingdom. It is all already given – you just don’t have the courage and the consciousness to enjoy it.\nOne thing will become clear: that desiring was futile. It was not needed at all. You were desiring something that is already given to you, that is already the case. And the second thing you will see: that the people who are suffering, who are in misery, are being devoured by evils, that is their own choice. Suffering is our own choice. Grace, blessing, is a gift: suffering is a choice. Blessing is our nature – to be blissful, to be blessed, is natural.\nTo be miserable, to be in suffering, is our own effort, it is our own creation. Suffering has the signature of man, blessing has the signature of God. Suffering has to be earned – when you are able to see you will be surprised: suffering needs much more work, much more effort, because to suffer is almost making the impossible possible. It is not your nature to suffer, and still you create it. It needs arduous effort. Going against nature needs much work – and people are working day in, day out, year in, year out, life in, life out, people are working hard to create more and more suffering for themselves.\nIf you are suffering, remember, you must be creating it. There is no other way to suffer.\nBut if you feel blessed, then it is not your doing: it is a showering from the beyond. Suffering is man-made, bliss is god-made – bliss is your nature, your very nature, your very ground of being. When this has been seen, you have come home.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"8895","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/philosophia_perennis_vol_2/part6/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/philosophia_perennis_vol_2/>Philosophia Perennis, Vol 2</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">6 Enlightenment is Your Birthright</h1><div class=post-meta>42 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;8895 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Philosophia_Perennis_Vol_2/part6.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part5>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

THE FRUIT...</p><p>PYTHAGORAS’ CONTRIBUTION TO WESTERN PHILOSOPHY IS IMMENSE. It is
incalculable.</p><p>For the first time he introduced vegetarianism to the West. The idea
of vegetarianism is of immense value; it is based on great reverence for
life.</p><p>The modern mind can understand it far better now we know that all
forms of life are interrelated, interdependent. Man is not an island:
man exists in an infinite web of millions of forms of life and
existence. We exist in a chain, we are not separate. And to destroy
other animals is not only ugly, unaesthetic, inhuman – it is also
unscientific. We are destroying our own foundation.</p><p>Life exists as one organic unity. Man can exist only as part of this
orchestra. Just think of man without birds and without animals and
without fish – that life will be very very boring; it will lose all
complexity, variety, richness, colour. The forests will be utterly
empty, the cuckoo will not call, and the birds will not fly, and the
water will look very sad without the fish.</p><p>Life in its infinite forms exists as one organic unity. We are part
of it: the part should feel reverence for the whole. That is the idea of
vegetarianism. It simply means: don’t destroy life. It simply means:
life is God – avoid destroying it, otherwise you will be destroying the
very ecology.</p><p>And it has something very scientific behind it. It was not an
accident that all the religions that were born in India are basically
vegetarian, and all the religions that were born outside India are non-
vegetarian. But the highest peaks of religious consciousness were known
in India and nowhere else.</p><p>Vegetarianism functioned as a purification. When you eat animals you
are more under the law of necessity. You are heavy, you gravitate more
towards the earth. When you are a vegetarian you are light and you are
more under the law of grace, under the law of power, and you start
gravitating towards the sky.</p><p>Your food is not just food: it is you. What you eat, you become. If
you eat something which is fundamentally based on murder, on violence,
you cannot rise above the law of necessity. You will remain more or less
an animal. The human is born when you start moving above the animals,
when you start doing something to yourself which no animal can do.</p><p>Vegetarianism is a conscious effort, a deliberate effort, to get out
of the heaviness that keeps you tethered to the earth so that you can
fly – so that the flight from the alone to the alone becomes
possible.</p><p>The lighter the food, the deeper goes the meditation. The grosser the
food. then meditation becomes more and more difficult. I am not saying
that meditation is impossible for a non-vegetarian – it is not
impossible, but it is unnecessarily difficult.</p><p>It is like a man who is going to climb a mountain, and he goes on
carrying many rocks. It is possible that even when you are carrying
rocks you may reach to the mountain peak, but it creates unnecessary
trouble. You could have thrown those rocks, you could have unburdened
yourself, and the climb would have been easier, far more pleasant.</p><p>The intelligent person will not carry rocks when he is going to the
mountain, will not carry anything unnecessary. And the higher he moves,
the lighter and lighter he will become. Even if he is carrying
something, he will drop it.</p><p>When Edmund Hillary and Tenzing reached Everest for the first time,
they had to drop everything on the way – because the higher they moved,
the more difficult it was to carry anything. Even very essential things
were dropped. Just to carry yourself is more than enough.</p><p><br></p><p>Vegetarianism is of immense help. It changes your chemistry. When you
eat and live on animals.… The first thing: whenever an animal is killed
the animal is angry, afraid – naturally. When you kill an animal... just
think of yourself being killed. What will be the state of your
consciousness? What will be your psychology? All kinds of poisons will
be released in your body, because when you are angry a certain kind of
poison is released into your blood. When you are afraid, again a certain
other kind of poison is released into your blood. And when you are being
killed, that is the utmost in fear, anger. All the glands in your body
release all their poison.</p><p><br></p><p>And man goes on living on that poisoned meat. If it keeps you angry,
violent, aggressive, it is not strange; it is natural. Whenever you live
on killing, you don’t have any respect for life; you are inimical to
life. And the person who is inimical to life cannot move into prayer –
because prayer means reverence for life.</p><p><br></p><p>And one who is inimical to God’s creatures cannot be very friendly
towards God either. If you destroy Picasso’s paintings, you cannot be
very respectful towards Picasso – it is impossible. All the creatures
belong to God. God lives in them, God breathes in them, they are HIS
manifestation, just as you are. They are brothers and sisters.</p><p><br></p><p>When you see an animal if the idea of brotherhood does not arise in
you, you don’t know what prayer is, you will never know what prayer is.
And the very idea that just for food, just for taste, you can destroy
life, is so ugly. It is impossible to believe that man goes on doing
it.</p><p><br></p><p>Pythagoras was the first to introduce vegetarianism to the West. It
is of profound depth for man to learn how to live in friendship with
nature, in friendship with creatures. That becomes the foundation. And
only on that foundation can you base your prayer, your meditativeness.
You can watch it in yourself: when you eat meat, meditation will be
found to be more and more difficult.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha was born in a non-vegetarian family. He was a KSHATRIYA –
belonged to the warrior race – but the experience of meditation slowly
slowly transformed him into a vegetarian. It was his inner
understanding: whenever he ate meat, meditation was more difficult;
whenever he avoided meat, meditation was easier. It was just a simple
observation.</p><p><br></p><p>You will be surprised to know that the greatest vegetarians in the
world have been Jainas – but all their twenty-four Masters were born
into families of non-vegetarians. They were all warriors; they were
brought up as fighters. All the twenty-four Masters of the Jainas were
KSHATRIYAS.</p><p><br></p><p>What happened? Why did these people who were brought up, conditioned
from their very beginning to eat meat, create one day the greatest
movement in the world for vegetarianism? Just because of their
experiments with meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>It is an unavoidable fact that if you want to meditate, if you want
to become thoughtless, if you want to become light – so light that the
earth cannot pull you downwards, so light that you start levitating, so
light that the sky becomes available to you – then you have to move from
non-vegetarian conditioning to the freedom of vegetarianism.</p><p>Vegetarianism has nothing to do with religion: it is something
basically scientific. It has nothing to do with morality, but it has
much to do with aesthetics. It is unbelievable that a man of
sensitivity, awareness, understanding, love, can eat meat. And if he can
eat meat then something is missing he is still unconscious somewhere of
what he is doing, unconscious of the implications of his acts.</p><p><br></p><p>But Pythagoras was not heard, not believed – on the contrary, he was
ridiculed, persecuted. And he had brought one of the greatest treasures
from the East to the West. He had brought a great experiment – if he had
been heard, the West would have been a totally different world.</p><p><br></p><p>The problem that has arisen today, that we have destroyed nature,
would never have arisen. If Pythagoras had become the foundation for the
Western consciousness, there would not have been these great World Wars.
He would have changed the whole course of history. He tried hard, he did
whatsoever HE could – it is not his fault. But people are blind, people
are deaf; they can’t hear a thing, they can’t understand a thing. And
they are not ready to change their habits.</p><p><br></p><p>People live in their habits, mechanically they live. And he had
brought a message of becoming aware. Great meditative energy would have
been released in the West. It would have become impossible to produce
Adolf Hitlers and Mussolinis and Stalins. It would have been a totally
different world. But still the same old habit persists.</p><p><br></p><p>We cannot change human consciousness unless we start by changing the
human body. When you eat meat you are absorbing the animal in you – and
the animal has to be transcended. Avoid! If you really want to go higher
and higher, if you really want to go to the sunlit peaks of your
consciousness, if you really want to know God, then you will have to
change in every possible way.</p><p><br></p><p>You will have to look all around your life. you will have to observe
each small habit in detail – because sometimes a VERY small thing can
change your whole life. Sometimes it may be a very SIMPLE thing, and it
can change your life SO totally that it looks almost unbelievable.</p><p><br></p><p>Try vegetarianism and you will be surprised: meditation becomes far
easier. Love becomes more subtle, loses its grossness – becomes more
sensitive but less sensuous, becomes more prayerful and less sexual. And
your body also starts taking on a different vibe. You become more
graceful, softer, more feminine, less aggressive, more receptive.</p><p><br></p><p>Vegetarianism is an alchemical change in you. It creates the space in
which the baser metal can be transformed into gold.</p><p><br></p><p>THE SECOND THING that Pythagoras also introduced into Western
consciousness was the idea of reincarnation. That too is somehow related
with vegetarianism. You will be surprised again: all the vegetarian
religions believe in reincarnation, and all the non-vegetarian religions
believe only in one life. This can’t be just a coincidence.</p><p><br></p><p>In India, Brahminism, Jainism, Buddhism are the three great
religions. They differ in every possible way – their ideologies are so
different that you cannot find more different ideologies anywhere.
Hindus believe in God, they believe in the soul. Jainas don’t believe in
God – a tremendously fundamental thing – a religion without God.
Buddhists don’t even believe in the soul – no God, no soul. You cannot
imagine a religion without God and without the soul. Such are their
differences.</p><p>But about one thing they are all agreed, and that one thing is the
idea of reincarnation, rebirth. Even Buddha, who does not believe in the
soul, agrees with it. It looks very absurd – how can there be rebirth if
there is no soul? He does not believe in a soul but he believes in a
continuum. He says: Just as you light a candle in the evening in the
morning when you are blowing it out can you say it is the same flame
that you had started in the evening? It is not the same – and YET
somehow it is connected. The flame has been changing the whole night.
the flame was disappearing the whole night – it was disappearing into
smoke and a new flame was replacing it each moment. In fact the movement
was so quick, that’s why you couldn’t see the gaps. There has been a
continuum – a constant change, but very quick and fast – one flame being
replaced by another, the whole night.</p><p><br></p><p>So when in the morning you are putting the candle out, it is not the
same flame that you had started – although it looks almost the same. The
first flame and the last ARE connected – they are part of one chain, one
process – but you cannot say that there has been one flame, one
soul.</p><p><br></p><p>That is the Buddhist idea of reincarnation: the continuity continues
but individuals disappear – there is no individual soul. But still
Buddha believed in reincarnation. Jainas believe in reincarnation,
Brahmins believe in reincarnation.</p><p><br></p><p>But Jews, Christians and Mohammedans don’t believe. Those are the
three great religions which were born outside India. How did it happen
that all three Indian religions stumbled upon the fact of reincarnation?
– although they don’t agree in ANY other matter. Why do they agree about
one thing? They COULD not disagree. From where did this experience come
to them?</p><p><br></p><p>And you will be surprised – the answer is vegetarianism.</p><p><br></p><p>When a person is utterly vegetarian he can easily remember his past
lives. His clarity is such that he can look into his past lives. He is
not gross, his energy is not blocked, his energy moves easily. His river
of consciousness can penetrate to the ancientmost times; he can go
backwards as much as he wants.</p><p><br></p><p>The consciousness of a non-vegetarian is blocked – in many ways. He
has been accumulating gross matter in himself. That gross matter
functions as a barrier. That’s why all the three religions that were
born outside India, and have remained non-vegetarian, could not come to
the idea of reincarnation. They could not experience it.</p><p><br></p><p>Pythagoras lived in India, lived the life of a vegetarian, meditated
deeply, became aware of the past lives, could see himself moving
backwards. He could understand what Buddha means when he says, “Once I
was an elephant, once I was a fish, once I was a tree.”</p><p><br></p><p>The idea of evolution has been here in the East for ever – and in a
far more subtle way than it has been given to Western science by Darwin.
Darwin’s idea is very raw: he says monkeys have become man – although
Darwinians have not yet been able to prove it, because they are still
searching for the link between the monkey and the man. And the problem
arises: why did only a few monkeys become men? What happened to other
monkeys? And monkeys are basically imitators – if a few monkeys had
become men then all the monkeys would have imitated. What happened to
the other monkeys? Great imitators they are – why only a few men?</p><p>And the monkeys are still there! Thousands and thousands of years
have passed and monkeys are still monkeys. And you don’t come across a
monkey suddenly becoming a man... one fine morning he wakes up and he is
a man. Nobody has ever seen this miracle happen.</p><p><br></p><p>The question is: where are the links between monkey and man? – and
the difference is great, it is not small.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the other day somebody asked, John Lilly has said that man is
not the only being on the earth who has consciousness; there are other
beings too who have more consciousness than man.” The questioner has
asked, “Is it true? Is John Lilly right?”</p><p><br></p><p>But those other animals have not discovered man yet – it is John
Lilly who discovers those other animals. It is man who goes on
discovering. Certainly the discoverer has more consciousness than the
discovered. Even if we find some day that some animal has a great,
evolved brain, WE are the discoverers. That great brain has not
discovered us just.</p><p><br></p><p>There are animals who are very evolved, but nobody is as evolved as
man. And the difference is big! John Lilly has been working on dolphins,
and he thinks that dolphins have a far better evolved consciousness. If
you just meet John Lilly some time, tell him that dolphins have not
discovered him – he has discovered dolphins. And the discoverer has more
consciousness, obviously.</p><p><br></p><p>Dolphins are not saying anything about themselves – it is a man who
is saying something about dolphins. They cannot even prove something
about themselves. Dolphins are beautiful people, and Lilly is on the
right track, but dolphins don’t have a higher consciousness than man.
They have not produced Buddhas, Patanjalis, Pythagorases – not even a
John Lilly.</p><p><br></p><p>The Western concept of evolution, the Darwinian concept of evolution,
is very gross. The Eastern idea of evolution is very subtle. It is not a
question of the body of a monkey becoming the body of man – it has never
happened; of the body of a fish becoming the body of man – it has never
happened. But the inside of the fish goes on growing; it goes on
changing from one body to another.</p><p><br></p><p>The growth, the evolution, has not happened from body to body: the
growth has been happening in consciousness. When a monkey attains to a
certain consciousness, the next birth will be that of man not of a
monkey. He will die as a monkey and will be born as a man. The evolution
is not going to happen in the body of the monkey itself. That body has
been used by the soul – or whatever you call it, the continuum – the
body of the monkey has been used, now the soul is ready to take a better
body, a body where more possibilities of growth will become
available.</p><p><br></p><p>The soul moves from one animal to another animal. The bodies are not
evolving, but souls are evolving. The candles are not evolving, but the
flames go on jumping from one candle to another. The flame goes on
rising higher and higher. The evolution is of consciousness, not of the
material, physiological body. That is where Darwin missed the whole
point.</p><p><br></p><p>But in the East for at least ten thousand years we have been aware of
it. The awareness came through meditation and the awareness was based in
vegetarianism – because people started remembering their past lives.</p><p>It was a basic technique with both Buddha and Mahavira: whenever a
disciple was to be initiated, the first thing that both Buddha and
Mahavira required was that he had to go into his past lives. Great
methods were developed so that one could move into past lives.</p><p><br></p><p>And once you start moving into past lives, this life will be utterly
transformed. Why? Because once you see that all the stupid things that
you are doing now, or wanting to do, you have been doing for many many
lives... you have done those same things many times, and each time
nothing was attained.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, if you are mad after money and then you remember that in
the past life also you were mad after money and then you had succeeded,
and you had become a rich man, a very rich man, and then you died... and
all that richness and all that wealth was of no use. It was taken away
by death, and you died as empty as ever, as poor as ever. And you
remember even before that: you were a king and you had a great kingdom.
And still you were frustrated, and still you lived in misery, and you
died in misery. And again you are doing the same and hankering for more
money? It will become impossible. The longing will simply fall flat on
the ground. How can you go on repeating the same stupid thing again and
again if YOU CAN REMEMBER? YOU can go on repeating the same stupidity
again and again if you CANNOT remember.</p><p><br></p><p>The idea of reincarnation is not a philosophical idea: it is an
experience, it is utterly scientific. People have remembered their
lives.</p><p><br></p><p>When you have grown a little deeper into meditation... we are going
to do all those techniques here too. But those techniques will require
that you be absolutely vegetarian, otherwise you will not be able to go
beyond THIS life. Your mind cannot move – it has to be so light,
featherlight, that it can simply pass from one existence into another.
And the lighter it is, the deeper it goes.</p><p><br></p><p>It can not only remember that you were a man in the past life –
slowly slowly, you will remember that you have been animals. AND,
sometimes, when the depth gross, you will remember that you have been
trees, rocks. You have lived for millennia in many forms. And if you
remember that once you were a fish, it will become difficult for you to
eat fish.</p><p><br></p><p>Vegetarianism leads you into remembering your past lives. And KNOWING
your past lives, you become more and more a vegetarian – because seeing
that all are brothers and sisters, the whole existence, you cannot kill
animals. It becomes simply impossible! Not that you have to prevent
yourself: it simply becomes impossible.</p><p><br></p><p>Pythagoras was a REAL adventurer. Alexander the Great also came to
India, he also took away many things from India, but they were useless
things – diamonds and emeralds and gold. That’s what Alexander the Great
took away from India – useless things. Pythagoras was a real seeker. He
gathered real diamonds, real emeralds: diamonds of consciousness,
emeralds of consciousness. And these were two tremendously significant,
tremendously pregnant approaches – that of vegetarianism and the idea of
reincarnation.</p><p><br></p><p>Once it happened: Pythagoras saw somebody hitting a dog. He said, “Do
not hit him!” to the man who was beating the dog. “It is the soul of a
friend of mine. I recognized it when I heard it cry out.”</p><p>Now this looks utterly ridiculous to a Western mind, to the Western
scientific attitude. Even in those old days, people must have laughed:
“What nonsense he is talking about! – ‘Don’t beat the dog because I have
recognized a friend.’” He was simply trying to teach the idea of
reincarnation in every way possible.</p><p><br></p><p>And the third thing: he was, again, the first to introduce the
concept that life is a wheel – a wheel of birth and death. The wheel
goes on moving and we go on clinging to the wheel. And the wheel is
repetitive; again and again it will move on the same track. Nothing new
will ever happen. Birth will come, you will become young, you will be
full of sex and great desires, and then you will be spent and you will
be old, diseased, ill sick, frustrated, tired. And then death... and
again birth... and so on and so forth.</p><p><br></p><p>Each birth brings a death, each death brings a birth. It is a vicious
circle, and the wheel goes on moving. In India the word for the world is
SAMSARA. SAMSARA means ‘the wheel’. Youth or childhood or old age are
just spokes of the wheel. and we go on clinging to the wheel and the
wheel goes on moving – as everything else moves in the world. The earth
moves around the sun, and the sun also moves around some unknown sun.
And the moon moves around the earth, and earth and moon both move around
the sun, and the sun around some other sun, and so on and so forth. And
all the stars are moving.<span class=s4></span>And EVERYTHING IS
moving in a circle! Seasons move in a circle.</p><p><br></p><p>Life is a wheel and the wheel is repetitive. You will never reach
anywhere if you go on clinging to the wheel. In the East it has been a
known fact that we have to jump out of the wheel – only then are we
free. To be free from this wheel of birth and death is to have freedom.
Then you simply ARE. Then you are not moving.Then there is no past and
no future but only the present. Then NOW IS the only time and here the
only space.</p><p><br></p><p>That is the state of nirvana, MOKSHA – freedom. That is the real
kingdom of God. One simply is... all turmoil gone, all storms finished,
and there is absolute silence. In that silence there is a song, in that
silence there is music – unheard music, unstruck music. In that silence
is joy, in that silence is bliss. And that bliss is eternal, it never
changes.</p><p><br></p><p>All change is if you are clinging to the wheel. If you drop out of
the wheel, all change disappears. Then you are here and always here.</p><p><br></p><p>That state is the real search of all true seekers: how to get out of
this wheel of birth and death, how to enter into life eternal where no
birth ever happens and no death either, where nothing begins and nothing
ends, where all simply is – how to enter into this God. Just the other
day, I was saying God means ‘that which is’... how to enter into that
which is? These are the sutras by which to enter into that which is.</p><p><br></p><p>The third part: perfection.</p><p><br></p><p>LET NOT SLEEP EVER CLOSE THY TIRED EYES WITHOUT THOU ASK THYSELF.
WHAT HAVE I OMITTED AND WHAT DONE?</p><p><br></p><p>ON THE SURFACE it will appear a very simple, moralistic sutra. It is
not. It has something tremendously meaningful – it has the whole idea of
depth psychology in it. But the language is</p><p>twenty-five centuries old. Now modern therapies say that if any
experience remains incomplete then it becomes a hangover. This is a new
insight in modern psychology, but it is nothing new as far as Eastern
psychology is concerned.</p><p><br></p><p>If you live some experience totally, you are finished with it – it
never accumulates in you. If you live it only half then the unlived part
goes on hankering to be lived. The whole of psychoanalysis, psychodrama,
primal therapy, is based on this idea.</p><p><br></p><p>What is psychotherapy? Basically, helping you so that you can live
unlived experiences of the past, or half-lived experiences of the past,
again. Creating a context in which you can again live those moments
which have remained incomplete. Once they are complete, once you can put
a full point to them, they are finished, you are free of them.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember, this as a VERY fundamental law: any experience that is
complete, you are finished with it. It leaves no karma, it creates no
karma. It creates no trace, it leaves no trace in you – not even
footprints. Nothing is left of it. It simply disappears, evaporates.</p><p><br></p><p>If you have loved a woman totally, wholly, and the woman dies, you
will be surprised – yes, it feels a little sad, but you are not going
crazy or anything. You are not beating your chest and crying and
shouting, “I will kill myself. I cannot live any more.” If you have
loved the woman totally and she dies, yes, a sadness... but that sadness
is beautiful – it is just a silent goodbye. But you will not commit
suicide, and you will not cry and weep for months and years. Maybe a few
tears, but those tears will not be of misery and suffering – on the
contrary, they will be of gratefulness, of thankfulness.</p><p><br></p><p>You are thankful to the woman – she had given you much. She had made
you a grown-up person; she had showered much love on you. And you are
not feeling guilty, because you have given all that you could.</p><p><br></p><p>If you have not loved the woman totally, then you will feel guilty.
And out of guilt, suffering. And then you will move to the other
extreme: you will cry and weep and you will not eat any food and you
will be miserable for months, for years, even for your whole life –
because deep down, now you are repenting. The woman is gone, and you
never loved her. And now there is no possibility of ever seeing her
again. You cannot have any opportunity even to apologize. You cannot say
to her, “Forgive me. I have not loved you as I should have loved you.”
Now that incomplete experience will hover around you like a dark
cloud.</p><p><br></p><p>In psychodrama you will live that experience again, you will create
the fantasy again. And once you can create that fantasy again – even if
in your imagination – or you can act the same thing again believing some
other woman to be that woman, if you can enact the whole act again, if
you can go through the drama of it, you will be relieved. There will
come a full point. You will be released from the cage.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what happens in primal therapy. You have to live the birth
trauma again. And once you have lived the birth trauma again, something,
a heavy weight from your chest, disappears.</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s what happens in psychoanalysis. You have to say to the
psychoanalyst all that is clamouring inside you – sense, nonsense,
relevant, irrelevant, consistent, inconsistent – all the</p><p>crazy things that are clamouring there asking for your attention. But
you don’t have any time, and nobody else has time enough to hear you, to
listen to you.</p><p><br></p><p>Psychoanalysis is a simple thing; it is more a trick than a
treatment. The psychoanalyst does nothing; he simply sits behind the
couch. He may not even be listening to you – how can one go on listening
to every kind of madness every day? One has to protect one’s own sanity
too. He may be having his own fantasies – because he has as much
nonsense in him as you do. He has to live his own nonsense.</p><p><br></p><p>But you feel that he is listening to you, so you can pour your heart
out. And just by pouring your heart out, something is released – it is a
catharsis.</p><p><br></p><p>Pythagoras is using a very ancient dictum, simple. Why wait for the
psychoanalyst and why wait for something like psychodrama or primal
therapy? Why not go on finishing every experience every day?</p><p><br></p><p>In the night, before going to sleep, just look back. Those twelve
hours that you have lived, finish everything. It is easier – rather than
accumulating for years and then going to a therapist, why not be a
therapist to your own self? And it is so easy to do it every day. It is
not a big problem, only a small accumulation – it can be finished.</p><p><br></p><p>LET NOT SLEEP EVER CLOSE THY TIRED EYES WITHOUT THOU ASK THYSELF.
WHAT HAVE I OMITTED AND WHAT DONE?</p><p><br></p><p>“What have I done and what have I not done?” Just go through it: let
there be a deep meditation of all that you have done today. Slowly
slowly, live again from the morning; just start from the morning again,
the first moment when you had opened your eyes, remember those moments –
not only remember: RELIVE.’ those first moments when you had opened your
eyes. The birds were singing outside, the sun had risen – listen to
those birds again. And the rays of the early morning sun were coming
through the curtain, and the curtain was looking so golden... just
relive it. And your wife was preparing tea in the kitchen, and the
children were getting ready to go to school – just remember, relive,
from the moment.</p><p><br></p><p>And then go on slowly, very meditatively, seeing what you have done
in the whole day, and what you have not done. What has remained undone?
What has remained incomplete? At least in your imagination, complete it!
If you have done something wrong, at least in your imagination put it
right. If you have missed and omitted something, at least in your
imagination complete it. And you will be surprised – you will never need
any therapy, because every day you will be finished with all the dust.
Things will be put right.</p><p><br></p><p>ACCORDING TO PORPHYRY, two lines are missing in THE GOLDEN VERSES
here, which ought to be placed preceding this sutra. My feeling also is
that those two lines ARE missing. Those two lines are:</p><p><br></p><p>ON THE MOMENT OF AWAKENING, CONSIDER CALMLY WHAT ARE THY DUTIES, AND
WHAT THOU SHOULDST ACCOMPLISH.</p><p><br></p><p>[Here is printed the Greek text]</p><p>It seems those two lines MUST have been there – somewhere they must
be lost – because if it is good to contemplate in the night, just to
look backwards at what you have done and what you have not done, then
the other part is also significant. It is the other aspect of the same
coin.</p><p><br></p><p>Early in the morning, when everything is fresh, and the whole night’s
sleep has rejuvenated you, when the mind has not entered yet... have you
watched? It takes a few seconds for the mind to start functioning.
Immediately you become aware that you are awake, just look in:
everything is silent. Within seconds, two or three seconds, the mind
will be awake and will start working. Before that happens, in that
moment of silence, in that meditative moment, it is good to have a
vision of the day that you are going to live.</p><p><br></p><p>ON THE MOMENT OF AWAKENING...</p><p><br></p><p>It has to be done IMMEDIATELY! If you lose a few moments it is gone.
In the very moment of awakening you are a mirror. Just let the mirror
see the whole day that is ahead.</p><p><br></p><p>... CONSIDER CALMLY WHAT ARE THY DUTIES, AND WHAT THOU SHOULDST
ACCOMPLISH.</p><p><br></p><p>Just let a simple seed fall into your heart. It is not planning,
remember – don’t misunderstand Pythagoras. It is not planning: it is
just a simple seed falling into the heart that “This is my vision for
today.” And that seed will affect your whole day’s activities, your
quality.</p><p><br></p><p>And in the night again remember the vision, and remember what has
been accomplished, what has not been accomplished – relive it. The
circle is complete. And every day, living this way, you will not need
any therapy ever.</p><p><br></p><p>ABSTAIN THOU IF IT IS EVIL; PERSEVERE IF GOOD.</p><p><br></p><p>If in the night meditating, reliving the whole day, you find
something is evil, abstain from it, don’t go on repeating it. And if
something is good, persevere. And what is evil according to Pythagoras
and according to me and according to all the Buddhas? Anything that
needs unconsciousness for it to be done is evil; anything that cannot be
done without unconsciousness is evil. And anything that needs
consciousness for it to be done is good; anything which cannot be done
without consciousness is good. So, looking back, see what you have done
the whole day: when you were aware and when you were unaware; when you
functioned like a machine, like a robot, and when you functioned as a
consciousness. And whenever you functioned as a consciousness, you were
doing something good.</p><p><br></p><p>You will be surprised to know that whenever you function as
consciousness, good happens of its own accord. And whenever you function
as unconsciousness, something goes wrong. Unconsciousness is evil:
consciousness is virtue.</p><p><br></p><p>MEDITATE UPON MY COUNSELS, LOVE THEM, FOLLOW THEM, TO THE DIVINE
VIRTUES WILL THEY KNOW HOW TO LEAD THEE.</p><p><br></p><p>MEDITATE UPON MY COUNSELS...</p><p>HE IS NOT SAYING BELIEVE – he says meditate. He says: Become a mirror
to whatsoever I am saying. And he does not say that these are
commandments but only counsels. He is not saying that you HAVE to do it:
these are not orders – these are simple counsels, a helping hand from a
friend who wishes only blessings for you.</p><p><br></p><p>MEDITATE UPON MY COUNSELS...</p><p><br></p><p>... just listen silently, without prejudice. Don’t be in a hurry to
decide what is right and what is wrong. Just let it sink deep in you;
watchful witnessing, let it penetrate your heart. That is
meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>Listen meditatively to MY COUNSELS, LOVE THEM...</p><p><br></p><p>Love arises spontaneously if you can meditate. If you cannot
meditate, then logic arises spontaneously. These are the two outcomes.
How you listen, everything depends on that.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, you are listening to me. Those who have fallen en
rapport with me, they are listening in a totally different way – they
are meditating, they are utterly silent. They are simply drinking
whatsoever I am saying to them. They know I am their friend; they know
that whatsoever I am saying is not a commandment but only a counsel,
only advice.</p><p><br></p><p>If you meditate on what I am saying then love will arise in you. And
if you argue with me, don’t meditate with me – you listen there with all
your prejudices, with your ideology, with your scriptures, with your
whole past shouting inside you – if you are comparing, judging,
criticizing, arguing, then logic will arise in you.</p><p><br></p><p>Logic arises only when you listen with prejudice, when you are not
really listening but arguing, when you are really defending, afraid,
fighting . So what arises in you will decide whether it was meditatively
listened to or not. Let this be the criterion: if love arises that means
you have listened rightly; if logic arises that means you missed the
point – you listened to the words but you missed the silence. You
understood only intellectually, but your heart remained unmoved; you
didn’t allow your heart to move.</p><p><br></p><p>MEDITATE UPON MY COUNSELS, LOVE THEM...</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation is the base, then love comes on its own. And if love
comes, follow them. It will not be a question of imitation, it will not
be a question of believing. Your very love will make you capable of
acting accordingly. A commandment has to be followed forcibly; you have
to enforce it upon yourself. A counsel is not to be enforced: you heard
it, you loved it; now, on your own, you start acting, you start
functioning. The act grows out of love just as love grows out of
meditation. Meditation is the root, love is the tree, and following is
the flowering.</p><p><br></p><p>TO THE DIVINE VIRTUES WILL THEY KNOW HOW TO LEAD THEE.</p><p><br></p><p>And then you need not be worried: divine virtues will arise in you as
a gift from God. One virtue is human, one is divine. The human virtue is
that which you have to force upon yourself; it is man- made. The divine
virtue is that which is a gift from the unknown, a gift from the beyond,
a nod, a yes, from the beyond.</p><p>If you do these three things with a Master – meditating, loving,
following – that’s enough. These will take you to the very source of
divine virtues. Then a person becomes virtuous but never becomes
righteous.Then a person becomes a sage but never becomes a saint. Then a
person becomes so religious that he is neither Mohammedan nor Hindu nor
Christian – he is simply religious. Then a person lives in God and God
lives through him: he becomes a vehicle, he becomes a hollow bamboo, and
God starts singing through him.</p><p><br></p><p>I SWEAR IT BY THE ONE WHO IN OUR HEARTS ENGRAVED THE SACRED TETRAD,
SYMBOL IMMENSE AND PURE, SOURCE OF NATURE AND MODEL OF THE GODS.</p><p><br></p><p>THE SACRED TETRAD HAS TO BE UNDERSTOOD. It means number four. Three
dimensions are of God AS manifestation, and there is a fourth dimension
– God as unmanifest. Three dimensions are visible, the fourth dimension
is invisible. All these four dimensions make the sacred Tetrad. If you
have read P. D. Ouspensky’s great book, THE FOURTH WAY, you will
understand what the Tetrad is.</p><p><br></p><p>Gurdjieff used to say that his way is the fourth way. There are four
possibilities because there are four dimensions. The first is the
physical possibility, hatha yoga, the way of the fakir – yoga postures,
standing on your head, distorting, contorting your body – that is the
lowest and the ugliest, the most gross and materialistic way. It leads
up to a certain extent.</p><p><br></p><p>The second way is that of the mind, the way that is followed by all
psychotherapies. Better than the first, but still something of the
manifest, still gross – subtler than the first, but still gross.</p><p><br></p><p>The third is the way of the soul – followed by religions,
philosophies. That seems to be the highest possibility ordinarily. But
there is one more, the fourth way.</p><p><br></p><p>The third way seems to be the highest as far as manifestation is
concerned, but there is a fourth – which contains all and yet is beyond.
Gurdjieff says: “My way is the fourth way.”</p><p><br></p><p>Patanjali says also that there are four states of consciousness: the
waking, JAGRAT; the dreaming, SWAPNA; the sleeping, SUSHUPTI; AND the
fourth... for the fourth he gives no name – he simply calls it TURIYA;
TURIYA means the fourth. TURIYA is exactly the meaning of Tetrad – the
fourth. And the fourth means absolute awakening, pure awakening.</p><p><br></p><p>What we know as awakening is not much of an awakening. In the morning
you wake up, but you simply wake up from one dream into another dream;
you wake up from the private dream into the collective dream, that’s
all. You get out from a small prison into a bigger prison, that’s all.
It is not much of an awakening – because the same desires persist and
the same illusions persist and the same state of mind remains.</p><p><br></p><p>Your awakening is not real awakening; it is pseudo. The real
awakening happens only in the fourth – where all dreams have
disappeared, the whole world that you had known in your waking has
disappeared, is no more known, that which you had known in your dreams
is no more known. That which you had known even in your deep sleep, that
joy of deep sleep, that silence, that rejuvenating energy of deep sleep,
even that is gone. Now you have arrived at the very source, but that
source is unmanifest, it is invisible. That invisible source is God.</p><p>Pythagoras says:</p><p><br></p><p>I SWEAR IT BY THE ONE WHO IN OUR HEARTS ENGRAVED THE SACRED TETRAD,
SYMBOL IMMENSE AND PURE, SOURCE OF NATURE AND MODEL OF THE GODS.</p><p><br></p><p>If you can know the fourth, you will have known the very model of
God, you will have known the very source of nature, you will have known
TAO, DHAMMA, LOGOS. You will have known from where everything comes and
to where everything goes – the source and the goal, the alpha and the
omega.</p><p><br></p><p>BUT BEFORE ALL, THY SOUL TO ITS FAITHFUL DUTY, INVOKE THESE GODS WITH
FERVOUR, THEY WHOSE AID, THY WORK BEGUN, ALONE CAN TERMINATE.</p><p><br></p><p>Pythagoras says: Before you enter into the world of the fourth, the
invisible, and before you start moving on this inner pilgrimage of
perfection, the first thing is: ask the hell of the Gods. It is just all
expression for asking the existence to help you, asking the whole to be
friendly to your efforts. In essence, it means prayer.</p><p><br></p><p>Have you heard it or not? that many experiments have been done around
the world in which a religious person prays, and with prayerful hands,
when he is vibrating with the prayer, he touches water – that water is
showered on a particular plant. The same water untouched by the
prayerful hands, is showered on another plant – both of the same age,
but the one which receives the water touched by prayerful hands grows
faster. Within weeks it is double the size of the other one which has
received simple water exactly the same, only one thing missing – the
vibe of the prayerful hands.And the plant that has been blessed by
prayerful hands brings bigger fruits, bigger flowers, and sooner than
the other. The flowers have more fragrance than the other, and the
fruits are more juicy than the other.</p><p><br></p><p>This has been repeated now, and now it is almost a scientific thing;
it cannot be denied any more. Of course, how it works nobody knows. Why
does prayer help so much? For example, if somebody has a headache and
you are giving a massage, it is better first to pray and let your hands
vibrate with prayer, and then massage. And you will see a tremendous
change – your hands will be so powerful.</p><p><br></p><p>Existence can help you if you ask – it only helps you if you ask. If
you don’t ask, it remains aloof, it does not interfere. But if you ask,
if you open up, existence starts pouring into you. And then the part has
as much energy as the whole. It depends on how much you open up: if you
open up totally, then the part is the whole, then a man is as magical as
the whole.</p><p><br></p><p>That is the whole secret of prayer: asking help from existence. And
you are going on a really dangerous journey, hazardous; there are many
pitfalls. And the higher you move, the more hazardous the journey
becomes, because if you fall... you will be lost for ever.</p><p><br></p><p>BUT BEFORE ALL, THY SOUL TO ITS FAITHFUL DUTY, INVOKE THESE GODS WITH
FERVOUR, THEY WHOSE AID, THY WORK BEGUN, ALONE CAN TERMINATE.</p><p><br></p><p>You cannot reach the goal alone. You can reach the goal only with the
help of the whole. That is the scientific meaning of prayer: invoking
the whole, asking the whole that “I am going on a long</p><p>journey – please be with me.” And slowly slowly you will see that a
great energy follows you. And slowly slowly you will become aware that
you need not do much: all that you need to do is to relax and absorb the
energy that follows you.</p><p><br></p><p>Prayer is the greatest power there is, because prayer makes the part
function as a whole.</p><p><br></p><p>INSTRUCTED BY THEM, NAUGHT SHALL THEN DECEIVE THEE: OF DIVERSE BEINGS
THOU SHALT SOUND THE ESSENCE, AND THOU SHALT KNOW THE PRINCIPLE AND END
OF ALL.</p><p><br></p><p>INSTRUCTED BY THEM...</p><p><br></p><p>And if you become available in prayer to the whole, you will start
hearing the still small voice within you – that is instruction from
God.</p><p><br></p><p>First meditate upon the counsels of your Master, love them, follow
them, then you have become capable of taking a plunge into prayer. The
Master is visible, God is invisible. You have learnt how to participate
in the being of the Master, now learn how to participate in the
invisible being of God who is the source of all and the end of all. That
is prayer. And in prayer you will start hearing a still small voice
within you.</p><p><br></p><p>Once that voice is clearly heard and understood, you need not depend
on the outer Master, you have found the inner Master. And you will be
surprised to see that the counsels from the outer Master and the
instructions from the inner voice are exactly the same. Your inner voice
is only represented by the outer Master. The outer Master has nothing to
say of his own accord: he simply looks into you, he simply finds your
own heart, and speaks for your inner heart.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why you will find so many inconsistencies in a Master’s
statements – because to one disciple he will say one thing, to another
disciple he will say something else. Because he is not there just
dishing out ready-made formulas – he is there to listen to your inner
voice. He has just to reflect you; he has to make your inner Master
available to you. You cannot yet directly contact the inner Master,
hence the outer Master is needed. But he is not to interfere. If he
interferes, he is not a Master at all. He simply interprets, he simply
communicates, your own inner voice to you because you yourself are not
yet capable of taking that plunge. Once you have started listening to
the inner instruction, nothing can ever deceive you. Then the whole life
is reflected so clearly that nothing can ever deceive you.</p><p><br></p><p>OF DIVERSE BEINGS THOU SHALT SOUND THE ESSENCE...</p><p><br></p><p>And whosoever comes in front of you, you will sound his essence, you
will know who he is, for what he is there, what his designs are, what
his strategies are, what games he wants to play. Before he appears you
will know... NAUGHT CAN DECEIVE THEE.</p><p><br></p><p>AND THOU SHALT KNOW THE PRINCIPLE AND END OF ALL.</p><p><br></p><p>IF HEAVEN WILLS IT, THOU SHALT KNOW THAT NATURE, ALIKE IN EVERYTHING,
IS THE SAME IN EVERY PLACE:</p><p><br></p><p>Listen carefully:</p><p>IF HEAVEN WILLS IT...</p><p><br></p><p>NOW YOU HAVE COME TO A POINT where ego has to be utterly dropped.
Preparing, the ego was there. Purifying, the ego was there. But now when
you are moving into the dimension of perfection, ego has to be utterly
dropped – no effort is even to be thought of of your own accord.</p><p><br></p><p>IF HEAVEN WILLS IT...</p><p><br></p><p>Now everything is God’s will: Thy kingdom come, thy will be done. Now
you have to relax totally into the whole.</p><p><br></p><p>IF HEAVEN WILLS IT THOU SHALT KNOW THAT NATURE.. .</p><p><br></p><p>You will come to know truth only if God wills it. You relax, you wait
in deep relaxation, you be patient. And once heaven wills it... and it
is BOUND to happen, the grace is bound to happen, only you have to
disappear. And in relaxing totally you disappear, you become just an
empty waiting, an empty vessel, a womb. And, IMMEDIATELY, whenever your
inner emptiness is absolute, God descends in you, and the whole mystery
is revealed to you. Then you will see all:</p><p><br></p><p>ALIKE IN EVERYTHING...</p><p><br></p><p>God is in everything.</p><p><br></p><p>... IS THE SAME IN EVERY PLACE:</p><p><br></p><p>Only God is, and nothing else. Only God exists. God is synonymous
with existence.</p><p><br></p><p>SO THAT, AS TO THY TRUE RIGHTS ENLIGHTENED, THINE HEART SHALL NO MORE
FEED ON VAIN DESIRES.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, when grace has arrived, only then will you know you were
unnecessarily begging, desiring. All the treasures are yours, the whole
kingdom is yours, the whole universe belongs to you. All the joys and
all the blessings are yours.</p><p><br></p><p>SO THAT, AS TO THY TRUE RIGHTS ENLIGHTENED...</p><p><br></p><p>But this will happen only when you have become utterly enlightened.
And what is enlightenment? The ego gone and God has appeared in you –
that is enlightenment. The ego is darkness, God is light.</p><p><br></p><p>... TO THY TRUE RIGHTS ENLIGHTENED...</p><p><br></p><p>And this is your right! your birthright – to become enlightened.
Never be contented with less than that. It HAS to be achieved because
you are MEANT to achieve it. You have to become it! because in the first
place you ARE it...</p><p><br></p><p>THOU SHALT SEE THAT THE EVILS WHICH DEVOUR MEN.</p><p>ARE OF THEIR CHOICE THE FRUIT...</p><p><br></p><p>And now you will see two things. One: desiring is meaningless because
all is given without even asking for it. All is being given as a gift!
You need not be a beggar: you are all emperors! The kingdom of God is
your own kingdom. It is all already given – you just don’t have the
courage and the consciousness to enjoy it.</p><p><br></p><p>One thing will become clear: that desiring was futile. It was not
needed at all. You were desiring something that is already given to you,
that is already the case. And the second thing you will see: that the
people who are suffering, who are in misery, are being devoured by
evils, that is their own choice. Suffering is our own choice. Grace,
blessing, is a gift: suffering is a choice. Blessing is our nature – to
be blissful, to be blessed, is natural.</p><p><br></p><p>To be miserable, to be in suffering, is our own effort, it is our own
creation. Suffering has the signature of man, blessing has the signature
of God. Suffering has to be earned – when you are able to see you will
be surprised: suffering needs much more work, much more effort, because
to suffer is almost making the impossible possible. It is not your
nature to suffer, and still you create it. It needs arduous effort.
Going against nature needs much work – and people are working day in,
day out, year in, year out, life in, life out, people are working hard
to create more and more suffering for themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are suffering, remember, you must be creating it. There is no
other way to suffer.</p><p><br></p><p>But if you feel blessed, then it is not your doing: it is a showering
from the beyond. Suffering is man-made, bliss is god-made – bliss is
your nature, your very nature, your very ground of being. When this has
been seen, you have come home.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part5>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

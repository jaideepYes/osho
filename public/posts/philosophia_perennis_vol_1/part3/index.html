GREAT JOY ARISES IN UNDERSTANDING THE PURPOSELESSNESS OF EXISTENCE.\nDeva Nirguna,\nTRUTH ALWAYS TRIGGERS A PROCESS IN YOU, even if the truth is not your own. The very hearing of it creates a parallel process in you. It is not caused by hearing it; it follows not the law of cause and effect but the law of synchronicity.\nListening to great music, music arises in you. There is no necessity: it may arise, it may not arise. There is no inevitability about it. But if you are open, it arises. If you are available, it arises. Watching a great dancer, something starts dancing in you. This is communion.\nThe truth of Pythagoras, the truth of the greatest synthesis ever attempted, CAN trigger a process in you, CAN start something so immense that you could not have ever dreamt about it. That is the whole purpose of satsang: being in communion with a Master. His presence, his utterances, his silences, start working on you AND sometimes even in spite of you. Sometimes you become aware of those processes, sometimes you are not even aware of them; they start working underneath your consciousness. One day they explode into great blossoming.\nPythagoras really has tried the impossible. And not only tried – he succeeded too. But the world wants to live in division, because the world can only understand conflict. It cannot understand synthesis. Synthesis can be understood only when some synthesis inside you starts happening; otherwise, synthesis is non-understandable, will be misunderstood.\nEverybody was against Pythagoras. All religions, all sects, all the so-called gurus of those days, were against Pythagoras. In fact, they should have been with him, because he was bringing all scattered fragments of truth together. But it hurts.…\nIf I say the Koran is true, AS much true as the Vedas, if people were understanding then Mohammedans and Hindus would both be tremendously happy – but that doesn’t happen. Both become angry. The Mohammedan becomes angry because I have compared HIS holy book with the ordinary book – Vedas? And the Hindu becomes angry because I have compared HIS holy book with an ordinary book – the Koran? They both become angry because their egos are hurt.\nAnd you can understand what must have happened to Pythagoras, because it is happening to me, it is happening to you. The SAME process! Hindus are against, Mohammedans are against, Jainas are against, Buddhists are against, Christians are against. Why? And I am bringing Christ and Buddha and Mahavira and Zarathustra and Lao Tzu and Krishna into the highest possible synthesis. Still they are all against it.\nThe reason is: they are divided within themselves. They can only understand THAT WHICH THEY ARE. YOU can never understand anything beyond your consciousness. If YOU are split, you can only understand a split world. If you are in a subtle harmony inside, then only will any harmony happening outside be understood.\nIt is good, Nirguna, that you felt great gratitude arising in you listening to the synthesis. It shows something has started becoming integrated in you – something that is bringing you together, that is creating a kind of unity between the two hemispheres of your brain, the left and the right.\nThese two hemispheres of the brain have to be understood, and very deeply – because much depends on that. Now scientists are also in deep agreement with the ancient mystic lore, that unless these two brains are bridged and bridged rightly, a man remains schizophrenic. They ARE bridged, but in a very very small way; just a small thread bridges them. That thread can be cut.\nSometimes it happens in an accident, in a car accident, for example – the bridge may be damaged. It is a very delicate bridge, JUST like a thread. Once it is cut, the person becomes two persons: one person becomes two persons. He starts behaving like two persons. And strange things have been observed.\nFor example: the left side of the brain is able to read and to remember. The right side of the brain is not able to read at all. So a strange thing happens: you can give the person something to read, he will read it, but only one part of his brain will remember it. If you anaesthetize his left side, he will not even remember that he has read anything. He HAS read something, but he will not remember.\nHis one hand may be doing something, but the other hand will not cooperate, because those two hands belong to different hemispheres. The right hand belongs to the left hemisphere. That’s why\nthe right hand has become so important. The right has become the RIGHT hand, and the left hand has become the wrong hand. Why? It is very symbolic.\nThe left hand is connected with the right hemisphere, and the right hemisphere represents intuition, psychic powers, meditation, love, poetry – because ALL these things are condemned, the left hand is condemned. The right hand represents logic, calculation, arithmetic, science – because these things are praised, the right hand is praised.\nTen percent of children are born lefthanded; out of ten, one person is lefthanded. You may not be able to find so many lefthanded people, because from the very beginning we start forcing them to write with the right hand, to do things with the right hand. This is destroying a minority. This is very oppressive, because the person who is born lefthanded has to be lefthanded if he is ever to be an authentic person. He will become phony. You will force him to use the right hand and because all are rightists – the teacher, the parents, other students in the school – he will feel guilty if he uses the left hand. He is doing something wrong.\nHe is NOT doing ANYTHING wrong – he is naturally a leftist. He has the capacity to become a poet. He has the capacity to become an intuitive person. He may develop prophetic powers. He may be able to read other people’s thoughts one day. He may be able to become a great hypnotic medium. He may even be able to have power of mind over matter. He has IMMENSE capacities! but he is crushed.\nThe society forces him to move to the right hand. The right hand is his weak hand. He will live a very weak life, unfertile, uncreative. He may have become a great seer; now he will live just as a third-rate mathematician. The person may have been a first-rate poet, or a musician, or a painter; now he will be just a third-rate clerk in some office, or a station-master, or a deputy collector, or a politician – something third-rate. You have been very very violent with him.\nThese two hemispheres are very slightly bridged; a little communication happens ordinarily. The more one becomes integrated, the deeper the communication that starts happening between these two hemispheres. In a Buddha those two hemispheres become one. He is AS logical as one can be and AS loving as one can be.\nThe left hemisphere, which is connected with the right hand, is under the law of necessity. And the right hemisphere, which is connected with the left hand, is under the law of power. And if both these laws become one, LOGOS arises, DHAMMA arises, TAO, TORAH, arises – the ultimate law, the law of laws. Then the man has a tremendous beauty and grace. He is the meeting of the earth and the sky, of man and woman; he is the meeting of all that is divided in existence. And in THAT meeting, God is known.\nAll the secret methods of all the mystery schools are nothing but alchemical processes to create a bridge between these two hemispheres, to bring them SO close, so utterly close, that they almost become one. When logic functions as love, love functions as logic, you have attained to the highest peak. At that peak, ecstasy simply happens – just as when spring comes, flowers start blossoming. When that synthesis, that spring, has happened in your inner world, you have come home, you have attained the one, the whole. You have become holy.\nNirguna, something is happening in you, as something is happening to all of my sannyasins. In those who are really close to me, those who are not just formally sannyasins, those who are really in love with me, those who have really said a YES to me, without any NO hiding behind it, this synthesis is happening. East and West ARE meeting, the sky and the earth ARE meeting, mind and matter are meeting.\nWhat Pythagoras did was destroyed. His whole academy, his whole school, was burnt. Hundreds of his disciples were massacred. We are trying to do it again, we are taking the risk again – the danger is there. The same can be our fate too. But it need not be. We can learn something from Pythagoras’ experiment. He was the first pioneer. He HAD succeeded in his life; he had succeeded with many of his disciples. But maybe he had come too early; the world was not yet ready.\nNow the world is scientifically ready. That time the world was not scientifically ready. East was East and West was West, and the bridge was almost impossible. Now science has brought people so close to each other that this is the climate in which spiritually also a synthesis is possible. At that time people were isolated. Once in a while a visitor might come from the West to the East... and remember, it was always a visitor from the West to the East; it was never a visitor from the East to the West. Why?\nThe West represents the male mind: it takes initiative. The East represents the female mind: it simply waits, it takes no initiative. It is like a man always proposes to the woman and says “I love you.” It is never the woman who proposes. And if a woman proposes to you, you would like to escape from her because she is not a woman; she has more of a male mind. You will become afraid. You will be offended. You will not be able to take it easily. The woman has to wait.\nThat’s why the West has always been sending feelers to the East. The East has simply waited; it has not gone anywhere. Once in a while a visitor may come. He will take with him the ancient lore of the East to the West, and he will always be misunderstood. It happened with Pythagoras, and after five hundred years it happened with Jesus.\nJesus had also been a visitor to the East; he learnt all in the East. And when he went back, he was not understood either; it was too foreign. The SAME way it is happening to my sannyasins: when you go to the West you are going to be misunderstood. But you are in a better position – you are so many. A Pythagoras came alone, went back alone; a Jesus came alone, went back alone. They were great adventurers.\nJesus was killed. Pythagoras’ academy was burnt, his disciples massacred. I he world was not yet so closely knit as it is today. Science and technology have brought people very close. All the barriers, at least the physical barriers, are re moved. Now the second step can be taken: psychological barriers can be removed – that’s what we are doing here.\nIt is good that the Pythagorean synthesis struck a chord in your heart, because that s my work too. And the second thing, Nirguna. you say:\nGREAT JOY ARISES IN UNDERSTANDING THE PURPOSELESSNESS OF EXISTENCE.\nJOY ARISES only when you understand that the whole cannot have any purpose. Parts can have purpose: the whole cannot have any purpose.\nYour house has a purpose: it is a shelter for you. a safety for you. The food has a purpose: it nourishes you, it keeps you alive. Your clothes are purposeful. your machines... and everything that you create is purposeful. But what purpose do you have?\nNow you start moving into the world of purposelessness. Still a few things you can find. You can say, “I am here to be happy.” But what purpose is there in being happy? What purpose does happiness have? You may say, “I am here to love.” But then love in itself is purposeless. It is AS purposeless as a roseflower, as a dewdrop slipping on the lotus leaf in the early morning sun. It is AS purposeless as the whole.\nThe closer you come to the whole, the more purposelessness becomes the law. Purpose belongs to the law of necessity: purposelessness belongs to the law of power. What is the purpose of the whole? No purpose at all – it is a sheer celebration. That’s why Hindus have called it LEELA – LEELA means a playfulness. It is just a play.\nPlay has no purpose. The moment play becomes purposeful it becomes a game, remember – that is the difference between play and game. If you are simply playing cards with no stake, with no money involved, it is a play. The moment you stake money, it is no more play – it is business. Purpose has entered. It is a game. Now you are gambling. Just a few moments before you were playing; now playing has become secondary. Now the question is how to succeed in getting more money. The thing has become serious; it is no longer weightless. It has fallen from the world of grace into the world of gravitation. It has fallen from the world of power into the world of necessity.\nThese two laws are tremendously beautiful. The law of necessity is equivalent to the law of gravitation. Science has recognized the law of gravitation, the law of necessity. Science has not yet recognized the higher law: the law of grace, the law of power. That’s why science goes on thinking in terms of cause and effect. It is still unaware of a higher law.\nReligion has discovered the higher law – the law of grace. Gravitation pulls you down... now this should be meditated over. If there is birth, there is death – to counterbalance it. If there is love, there is hate. If there is negative electricity, there is positive electricity. If there is a law that pulls things down, there MUST be a law that pulls things up.\nIt is simple logic! It need not be proved. It is VERY simple: in life everything is balanced by its polar opposite. So where is the polar opposite of gravitation? I ask. There must be one. And remember, even gravitation was not known before Newton; just for three hundred years we have known it. And it is not that the law of gravitation started functioning after Newton – it was functioning tor ever! Newton did not invent it: he only discovered it. And now the discovery looks very ordinary.\nNewton sitting under a tree, and an apple falls, and he contemplates over it: “Why does the apple always fall downwards? Why not sometimes upwards? or to the right? or to the left? Just going in any direction.Why does it always come downwards?” And something clicked in his mind, that\nthere must be some power that pulls it towards the earth. But apples have been falling always! Before Newton too. Apples don’t bother whether Newton has discovered the law or not. Apples have simply been falling without knowing any science of falling.\nAnd exactly the same has been happening with the law of grace. There have been people who have been falling upwards. A Buddha, a Jesus, a Pythagoras – these people have fallen upwards. They KNOW that something pulls up – if you allow. If you simply become effortless, if you DON’T do a thing, if you surrender, if you trust, something starts taking you upwards, you start levitating – not physically: spiritually. Something in you starts rising higher and higher and higher and reaches to the ultimate peak of consciousness. Just as the apple falls downwards, you start falling upwards.\nThere is a famous Sufi parable:\nA Sufi mystic who was known as a madman.… Many mystics have been known as madmen. They ARE in a sense. The world thinks they are mad, because they follow something utterly absurd in the eyes of the world. The world accumulates money, the world is in search of more and more power and prestige, and they are simply not concerned with these great things. The world wants to possess and have more and more. And there have been people who are not worried about having more and more. Certainly they look mad. They don’t have a thing to their name... remember Diogenes, not having a thing to his name, but still happier than Alexander the Great, utterly joyous. Even Alexander the Great had felt jealous. It is said that he said to Diogenes, “If next time I have to come into the world, I will ask God, ‘This time please make me Diogenes. I don’t want to become Alexander the Great again.”’ Must have felt very jealous of Diogenes, the naked madman.\nBut what did Diogenes say? He laughed and he said, “If I have another chance to come into the world, I cannot ask to be made Alexander the Great – because I am not stupid. And why do you want to wait for another life? You can become Diogenes right now, because to become an Alexander great effort is needed: to become a Diogenes no effort is needed. You can become immediately!” He said, “Throw you; clothes! Lie down by my side! I am taking a sunbath, you take one also. And forget all about conquering the world... you are a Diogenes THIS very moment!”\nThese people will look mad. He USED to look mad. Diogenes used to carry a lamp in full daylight. And whenever he met a person, he would take his lamp up and look into his face – in full daylight! And people would ask, “What are you doing?” And he would say, “I am searching for a man – I have not come across him yet.”\nAnd do you know what happened when he was dying? Somebody asked Diogenes, “Your whole life you have been searching for a real man. even in full daylight with a lamp – did you find him?”\nDiogenes opened his eyes and he said, “No, but I am dying happy – at least nobody has stolen my lamp yet.”\nThese people will look mad. The story, the Sufi story, says:\nA mad Sufi mystic stayed in the house of a disciple. The disciple was a little worried because this man was known to do strange things: “He may do something and may create some nuisance. And the neighbourhood and the people, what will they think? They will think that I am also mad, to be a disciple of such a mad man.”\nAnd it was known that even in the middle of the night he would start singing, shouting, or dancing, out of joy. So the disciple thought, “It will be better to keep him locked in the basement, so at least he doesn’t start doing something in the middle of the night.” So he locked him in the basement.\nAnd just in the middle of the night, it started happening – great rejoicing! shouting and dancing. And he was more puzzled because he heard him dancing on the roof! He rushed upwards. He asked, “But how did you manage? How did you come to the roof?”\nHe said, “What can I do? I opened my eyes and I saw I was falling upwards.”\nThis is a beautiful story – falling upwards. There is a law of falling upwards. And sometimes when you meditate, dance, sing, you will feel it: being possessed by something higher, from the above. And you are taken to higher plenitudes than you have ever known before.\nThat is the law of grace, or the law of power.\nAnd when you can use both the worldsOne belongs to science, one belongs to religion. And the\nworld is waiting for a NEW way of looking at things, in which science and religion will become one. Call it ‘religio-science’ or call it ‘science-religion’ – but the world is waiting for SOMETHING that will make these two laws function as one in a great synthesis.\nThat’s what I mean when I say that I would like my sannyasins to be like Zorba the Greek and Gautam the Buddha – both together. My effort here is to create Zorba the Buddha.\nThe second question Question 2\nOSHO, I LOVE THE WAY YOUR HANDS MOVE AND DANCE GRACEFULLY WHILE YOU ARE TALKING TO US. I FEEL INTOXICATED WITH YOUR HANDS AND THEIR EXPRESSIVE MOVEMENTS. WHAT IS THE SECRET OF YOUR HANDS?\nTHERE IS NO SECRET – I am just an old ancient Jew. And habits die hard.\nIt was a morning in December, and the air was bitter cold. Two Jews were walking down the sidewalk, and one of the pair, amid great puffs of steaming breath, was talking and gesticulating earnestly. The other, however, remained silent. Finally the first Jew paused in his discourse long enough to say, “Well, Moe, don’t you agree with me, what I say?”\nTo which Moe replied, “Ikey, you can talk all you want, but I am going to keep my hands in my pockets.”\nThe third question Question 3\nWHAT IS THE DE-ACTIVATION PROCESS OF THE LAW OF NECESSITY AND THE ACTIVATION PROCESS OF THE LAW OF POWER?\nAnurag,\nTHE LAW OF NECESSITY means you are unconscious, you are functioning like a robot. Only then does the law of necessity apply. So if you want to de-activate the law of necessity, the only way is to become more aware, more alert.\nDe-automatize your activities. Walking, walk with aware ness. Eating, eat with awareness. In the beginning it is very difficult, because you have always lived in unconsciousness. You walk mechanically – bring awareness to walking. And to bring awareness to walking, a few things will be needed.\nOne: don’t walk at the usual pace you walk – go slower. Go AS slow as you can, because if you go slower than you usually go, your old habit cannot persist. You are bringing something new into it and the body will have to get adjusted. It will take time, and that time can be used to become aware.\nIf you smoke cigarettes, go VERY slowly, take time. Take the packet of cigarettes VERY slowly from your pocket, as slowly as possible. Be in slow motion. And then slowly take a cigarette out, VERY slowly, as if you have no energy... and you are BOUND to be aware! Then tap the cigarette on the packet, AS slowly as possible, as if you are almost dead, and go on doing it for a longer time. Then very slowly put it in your mouth. Then wait! Don’t be in a hurry. Then bring your lighter... and the same, slow... take time. Smoke one cigarette in one hour. And you will be surprised how much awareness arises in you.\nAnd you will also be surprised to know: the moment you lose awareness, you fall back into the old fast motion. Slow down.…\nThat’s the whole process of vipassana. In vipassana you have to do two kinds of meditation: one is sitting, zazen; another is walking. WALK slowlyIt can be done in any way. Just breathe slowly,\nand breathing becomes a meditation. Let your hand move very slowly from one side to the other. And you will be aware.\nMake your activities de-automatized. And the more aware you are, the more the law of necessity starts disappearing. And when there is no law of necessity functioning, the other law functions automatically, of its own accord – the law of power.\nIt is said:\nOne day a great astrologer was coming back from Kashi. He had been learning astrology for twenty years in Kashi; he had become very famous. Now he was going back to his home town.\nPassing a river, on the soft, wet sand, he saw a few footprintshe could not believe his eves! “Those\nfootprints can only be of a man who is the ruler of the whole world!” That’s what his astrological books had been telling him for twenty years. The ruler of the whole world has a special name in India – he is called CHAKRAVARTIN – whose rule is on all the six continents. “What is a Chakravartin\ndoing in this poor village? Naked, barefoot, in the hot sun, on the bank of this small and dirty river? Impossible!”\nA great doubt arose in the astrologer: “Are my books wrong?” He studied the footprint very well; ALL the symptoms were there. He followed those footprints in search of this man... and he came across Buddha sitting under a tree.\nNow there was even more difficulty. The man looked like a great emperor: his grace, his beauty, and the silence that surrounded him, and the festivity that was around. Just by his presence, the tree was glowing, the rock he was sitting on was glowing. “He IS a Chakravartin! But he looks like a beggar too, with a begging bowl.”\nHe fell at the feet of Buddha and asked, “You have puzzled me very much. Should I throw my books? Twenty years I have wasted! Can I look at your feet?”\nHe looked at Buddha’s feet and he said, “Now it is absolutely certain: you should be a Chakravartin! – the greatest emperor in the world, the emperor of emperors. What are you doing here? I don’t even see a servant around you. And what is this begging bowl, and these old clothes you are wearing? Are you a beggar?”\nBuddha laughed and he said, “Don’t throw your books – they are right, but they are right only for the people who live under the law of necessity, those who live unconsciously. Once a person becomes conscious, he goes beyond astrology and astrological predictions. Then the law of necessity no longer applies to him. Then he is part of the infinite power then he is part of God – he IS a God. He lives in a totally different way . You cannot predict him; he is unpredictable.\n“Don’t throw your books. You will not come across a man like me again in your life. Don’t be worried. It rarely happens – very rarely it happens that a person is born as a Charkravartin; very rarely it happens that a person becomes a Buddha. And, of course, absolutely rare is the case when a Chakravartin becomes a Buddha. A Chakravartin in himself is rare; a Buddha in himself is rare – and the combination of a Chakravartin becoming a Buddha is absolutely rare. You will not come across such a person again in this life, or in MANY lives, so don’t be worried. I am an exception – and the exception proves the rule. You can follow your books, you can take your books, and you will ALWAYS be right. It is only this once that you have been wrong.”\nBecome conscious, Anurag. The more conscious you are, the more you are beyond prediction. Then you live EACH MOMENT in freedom – power means freedom. Power means free from the past karma. Power means you are no more dominated by the past. The past has no more power over you. Your each moment is free from the past moment. Your each moment is fresh, young, virgin. You LIVE it in total freedom! but it never creates a bondage for the moment that will be following it. Your each moment remains unpolluted, pure, crystal-clear.\nAnd to live in the law of necessity is to live in bondage. That’s what is meant by SAMSARA – the bondage, imprisoned. That is the whole meaning of the law of karma. In fact, the idea that Pythagoras got of the law of necessity is from the law of karma; that is his way of expressing it. The law of karma says: Whatever you have done in the past is still dominating you. You are possessed by the dead past; you are manipulated by the dead past. Whatsoever you have done yesterday has\nbecome a pattern, a structure, a character, and you are simply repeating it today. By repeating it, you will be enforcing it. Tomorrow it will become stronger, and the day after tomorrow even stronger. And life after life if you go on repeating a certain thing, it creates grooves in your mind – and then it becomes an absolute necessity. You simply live like a robot.\nGurdjieff used to say that man is a machine. It is true. Unless you become a Buddha, you are a machine. What does the word ‘Buddha’ mean? ‘Buddha’ means one who is awakened, aware.\nBecome aware. The man of awareness has no character. You will be surprised: I say the man of awareness is characterless – not in the sense that you give to the word ‘characterless’, but in a totally different sense he is characterless. Because he has no past to dominate him, no structure, no pattern. He is pure freedom. He is innocent. He responds to the moment, with no ready-made responses, because if a response is ready-made it is not a response at all: it is a reaction. He mirrors the moment as it is, and in that mirroring, he acts.\nThe unconscious person reacts: the conscious person acts. And if you can act consciously, TOTALLY in the moment, you don’t create any karma, you don’t create any structures. You always remain free; you always go on moving beyond the past. You go on slipping out of the past like a snake slips out of the old skin.\nThen life has tremendous beauty – because then there is power. And it is not YOUR power, so there is no question of any ego trip. Ego comes from the past; it is part of the law of necessity. Ego is your character, good or bad, but ego is the prison that keeps you in bondage. Ego arises out of your whole past.\nJust think for a moment: if you have no past, who are you? Suddenly the whole edifice of the ego collapses. The man of power is not really powerful in his own right: he is just a vehicle for the power of God. He has no claims. He simply functions as a representative of the whole. He is utter freedom, utter joy. He knows no boundaries, he is infinite. Space and time are no more relevant to him. He is beyond space, beyond time.\nThat is the meaning of being enlightened. Disappearing as a character, disappearing as a person, disappearing as an ego... and becoming one with the whole: UNIO MYSTICA. That mystic union... and you are no more there, and God is. And God is power.\nThe bridge from necessity to power is consciousness. Anurag, become more and more conscious in whatsoever you are doing. And it is your birthright to enter into the world of power, into the radiant world of power, the luminous world of power.\nThe fourth question Question 4\nOSHO, IS THE TIME RIPE FOR ME TO BECOME A SANNYASIN? CAN I ASK WHEN THE TIME IS RIPE?\nIT HAPPENED ON A JOURNEY BY SHIP: the parrot felt terribly bored and was really happy when one day he discovered that there was also a monkey on board. To pass the time the parrot said, “Let’s play hide-and-seek.”\nThe monkey said, “I don’t know this game. How does it go?”\nSo the parrot explained, “It is very simple. You close your eyes, face a wall and count to a hundred. In the meantime I hide and when you reach one hundred you start looking for me.”\nSo they did.\nBut it happened that the ship exploded at the same moment that the monkey reached one hundred. The parrot managed to find a plank floating in the sea. After a while he saw the monkey as he swam towards the plank totally exhausted. When the monkey had climbed up he looked at the parrot and said, “What a stupid game!”\nWhenever you feel life as a stupid game, it is time for sannyas. The fifth question\nQuestion 5\nCAN YOU SAY SOMETHING MORE ABOUT OBEDIENCE? IS IT NOT GOOD TO SERVE OBEDIENTLY IN A NOBLE CAUSE?\nAWARENESS IS THE ONLY VIRTUE WITH ME REMEMBER. If you serve with awareness, it is Good. If you serve in an unconscious way, it is bad. It is not a question of a noble cause. If you are unconscious, even a noble cause is going to be very ignoble. It is the consciousness that you bring to it that matters.\nYou can look in the history books: all kinds of mischief have continued on the earth in the name of noble causes. Christians. Mohammedans, Hindus, have been fighting, destroying each other – for noble causes. Communists, socialists, fascists, have been bringing more and more violence into the world and more and more murder – for noble causes.\nDo you think Adolf Hitlers cause was not noble? If it had not been noble, how could a very intelligent race like the Germans have followed him? And remember that the Germans are one of the most intelligent races on the world-map. This age’s four great minds who have dominated the whole world, all have come from Germany. Friedrich Nietzsche, Sigmund Freud, Karl Marx, Albert Einstein – these are the four great names of our times. They all came from the German mind, from German sources.\nHow could such an intelligent people follow this stupid megalomaniac, Adolf Hitler? In the name of a noble cause. The noble cause was: the world is in chaos and the world has to be dominated and ruled by the noble people, by the Aryans. Do you know? – the word ‘arya’ means noble. The world has to be dominated and ruled by the noblest of the noble.\nARYA IS a Sanskrit word. It means the noblest. Now, behind the word ‘noble’, Adolf Hitler was hiding all kinds of ugly things. And thousands and thousands of intelligent people followed him, obediently – because the cause was noble! Millions of Jews were burnt – in the name of a noble cause – millions suffered in concentration camps. And the people who were torturing them were\nnot unintelligent people, were VERY efficient and intelligent people. And they were doing their duty, obediently, for a noble cause.\nWhat happened in Russia? Joseph Stalin, another man of the same type as Adolf Hitler, murdered and butchered millions of people – again in the name of a noble cause: Communism has to be established, and any sacrifice is not too much. If communism, the paradise, the classless society, can arrive on the earth, then no sacrifice is too much.\nAnd the same has been happening down the ages: the Christian crusades, the Mohammedan JEHADS – wars of religion to SAVE religion. Of course, when Islam is in danger it has to be saved, and the people who are creating the danger have to be destroyed – in the name of a noble cause. When Christianity is in danger, then everything is allowed. And who decides when Islam is in danger? Who decides when Christianity is in danger? Who decides who is an Aryan and who is not?\nJews think they are the chosen people of God, and Adolf Hitler thinks Nordics, the purest Aryans, are the chosen people of God. Now there cannot live two people who think that they are the chosen people of God: one has to be destroyed, the competitor has to be destroyed. Look at the whole inhuman history of humanity and you will always find it is obedience to noble causes that has caused immense misery, that has made the whole life of humanity a nightmare.\nYou ask me: IS IT NOT GOOD TO SERVE OBEDIENTLY IN A NOBLE CAUSE?\nNo. Serve only with awareness. Obey only with awareness. Obedience should NOT be for something exterior. Obedience should be something interior. You should be able to see what is at stake. And you will be able to say yes or no according to your own conscience. Only then can the world become a little better, a little more human.\nThe people who dropped the atom bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki – just two persons! – they could have said no. It was so obvious that the one hundred thousand people who lived in Hiroshima were utterly innocent – small children, women, old people. Why drop an atom bomb that would destroy them immediately, within seconds? Within ten seconds Hiroshima was a dead city. Just ten seconds before, it was alive. It was time... people were taking their breakfast, people were singing, people were doing ALL kinds of things. Just a few seconds before, all was so alive. And after just a few moments, the whole of Hiroshima was just a cemetery – all dead people.\nThe person who dropped the bomb could have said no, but he was obediently serving a noble cause. What was the noble cause? – democracy. These big words are very dangerous, because behind them you can hide anything. Now in the name of democracy, capitalism hides itself. And in the name of equality, communism hides itself. Watch all big words, and whenever a politician uses a big word, be aware – there must be something fishy about it.\nAnd don’t go on following. It is better to die... if the man who was going to drop the atom bomb had said NO, it is possible he would have been court-martialled. So what? He could have said, “You kill me – that seems to be a lesser evil. I would like to die” – and that would have been a noble cause! – “You shoot me, but I simply say no. I will not drop this atom bomb on innocent people.”\nThe people who were destroying poor Vietnam could have said no. And the same is continuously repeated everywhere, all around the globe. Now it is time we should become more aware.\nObedience has been exploited. Obedience has been a very subtle strategy of the politician and the priest. If it comes out of your awareness, if you see that this is good – not that your leaders, your politicians, your priests, say it is good, but you feel it is good, it has to be your response – then do it by all means. But if you see... your individual conscience has to decide. That’s my whole point: each individual has to create his own consciousness and conscience – only then will we be able to create a better world. Otherwise, this world is going to commit suicide within twenty-five years.\nBy the end of this century, this foolish idea of obedience to noble causes is going to destroy the whole of humanity, and not only humanity – with humanity, all life on this earth, all trees, all birds, all animals – all kinds of life. And there are millions of kinds of life on this earth. This earth is a festival.\nIf you go on carrying this stupid idea that has been put into your mind down the ages... throughout the ages, you have been fed this idea with your mother’s milk: Obey! I teach you awareness. And, of course, out of awareness a totally different kind of obedience arises. Then you say yes because your heart says yes. and if your heart says no, then say no, and risk all for your no. That is human dignity.\nARTHUR KOESTLER WRITES ABOUT AN EXPERIMENT. Meditate over it:\nA series of highly original experiments was started by Doctor Stanley Milgram. The purpose of the experiments was to discover the limits of the average person’s obedience to authority when ordered to inflict severe pain on an innocent victim in the interests of a noble cause.\nThe noble cause was education. It involved three people: the professor, who was the authority figure in charge of the proceedings; the learner or victim; and the experimental subject, who was asked by the professor to act as teacher and to punish the learner each time he gave the wrong reply. Punishment was by electric shocks of growing severity, administered by the teacher on the professor’s orders. The learner or victim was strapped into a kind of electric chair. The teacher was seated in front of an impressive shock-generator which had a key-board of thirty switches ranging from fifteen volts to four hundred and fifty volts. There were also verbal inscriptions on the machine ranging from ‘slight shock’ to ‘intense shock’ to ‘danger: severe shock’.\nIn fact, the whole gruesome set-up was based on make-believe: the victim was an actor, the shock- generator was a dummy. Only the teacher, at whom the experiment was aimed, believed in the reality of the shocks he was ordered to administer and of the shrieks of pain and cries for mercy uttered by the victim.\nThe basic procedure was as follows: the learner was given to read a long list of paired words, that is ‘blue box’, ‘nice day’, ‘wild duck’, etc. Then in the examination he was given one test word, for instance, ‘blue’, with four alternative answers, that is ‘ink, box, sky, lamp’, and had to indicate which was the correct answer. The teacher was instructed by the professor to administer a shock each time the learner gave a wrong response, and moreover to move one level higher on the shock generator each time the learner gave the wrong answer. There was a fifteen volt increment from one switch to the next.\nTo make sure that the teacher was aware of what he was doing, the actor who played the role of the learner uttered complaints which increased in stridency according to the voltage, from mild grunts starting at seventy-five volts, in a crescendo, until at one hundred and fifty volts the victim cried out, “Get me out of here! I won’t be in the experiment any more. I refuse to go on!”\nRemember that the teacher believed that the victim too was a volunteer.\nAt three hundred and fifteen volts, after a violent scream, the victim reaffirmed vehemently that he was no longer a participant. He provided no answers, but screamed in agony whenever a shock was administered. After three hundred and thirty volts he was not heard from... yet the professor instructed the subject to treat no answer as a wrong answer, and to continue to increase the shock level according to the schedule. After three shocks of four hundreds and fifty volts, he called off the experiment.\nHow many people, in an average population, do you think would obey the command to carry on with the task of torturing the victim to the limit of four hundred and fifty volts? The answer seems to be a foregone conclusion: perhaps one in a thousand – a pathological sadist.\nBefore starting his experiments, Milgram actually asked a group of psychiatrists to predict the outcome. With remarkable similarity, they predicted that virtually all subjects would refuse to obey the experimenter. The consensus of the psychiatrists was that most subjects would not go beyond one hundred and fifty volts, that is when the victim asks for the first time to be released. They expected that only four percent would reach three hundred volts, and that only a pathological fringe of about one in a thousand would administer the highest shock on the board.\nIn actual fact, over sixty percent of the subjects continued to obey the professor to the very end – the four hundred and fifty volt limit. Remember: sixty percent.\nWhen the experiment was repeated in Italy, South Africa and Australia. the percent of obedient subjects was somewhat higher. In Munich it was eighty-five percent.\nThe act of shocking the victim does not stem from destructive urges, but from the fact that the subjects have become integrated into a social system which is based on obedience. To prove this point, Milgram carried on a further series of experiments in which the teacher was told that he was free to inflict on the learner ANY shock level of his own choice on any of the trials. Though given full opportunity, almost all subjects administered the lowest shocks, the mean shock level being fifty-four volts.\nRemember that the victim’s first mild complaint came only at seventy-five volts.\nIn the original experiments, when the teacher acted on orders, an average of twenty-five out of forty subjects administered the maximum shock of four hundred and fifty volts. In the free-choice experiment, thirty-eight out of forty did not go beyond one hundred and fifty volts – victim’s first loud protest – and only two subjects went up to three hundred and twenty-five and four hundred and fifty respectively\nThe vast majority of the subjects, far from deriving any pleasure from shocking the victim, showed various symptoms of emotional strain and distress. Some broke into a sweat, others pleaded with the\nprofessor to stop, or protested that the experiment was cruel and stupid. Yet two-thirds nevertheless went on to the bitter end.\nWe have been taught for centuries to obey – and to obey in the noble cause is a virtue; to disobey is a vice, is a sin. Disobeying any noble cause will create guilt in you. Obeying will make you feel good. AND YOU may even be obeying it in spite of your own conscience. You will see the futility, the stupidity, the cruelty of it.\nThe man who dropped the bomb on Hiroshima slept very well that night, and in the morning when he was asked how he was feeling, he said, “Perfect!” People could not believe it. They said, “Could you sleep in the night? One hundred thousand people have been burnt by you – could you sleep in the night?”\nHe said, “I slept VERY well, because I had done my duty. And when one does one’s duty well, one earns a good sleep.”\nTruman was the President of the United States when the atom bomb was dropped. When he was asked, “How do you feel?” he said, “I feel great! A noble cause has been served – democracy has won over fascist forces.”\nRemember always: big words are very dangerous. And big words have a very hypnotic power in them: democracy, God, religion, Bible... great words have a VERY hypnotic power over you. They can create a great unconsciousness in you, and you can go on doing things which you would have never even dreamt of doing without those big words.\nSo remember, ‘noble cause’ is a very dangerous game. Who decides what is noble? Let EACH individual decide according to his own conscience.\nAnd why in Munich was the percentage the highest? – eighty-five percent. Because Germans are very obedient. That has been their training, that has been their conditioning – and they have been praised for it. That has become part and parcel of their inner mechanism.\nThe disappearance of a sense of responsibility is the most far-reaching consequence of submission to authority.\nIt is very easy to dispense with your responsibility. You can always say, “What can I do? – I have been ordered.” And the higher person can say he has been ordered from a higher authority, and so on and so forth. Even the President can say, “I have been advised by the military experts.” And so on and on, round and round it goes. Nobody is REALLY responsible. Responsibility can always be shoved on somebody else’s shoulders.\nAnd a really religious person is a responsible person. He says, “I am responsible. If I am doing something, then I am responsible, and I have to think it over, whether to do it or not. If my OWN awareness allows it, I will do it; otherwise, whatsoever the consequences, I AM GOING TO DISOBEY.”\nSo obedience is not a value to me at all, neither is disobedience a disvalue. Your own understanding is the value. OUT of that, obedience is good; OUT of that, disobedience is also good.\nMorality does not disappear, but acquires a totally different meaning: the subordinate person feels shame and pride depending on how adequately he has performed the actions called for by authority. Language provides numerous terms to pinpoint this type of morality: loyalty, duty, discipline, obedience.…\nGreat words! Beware of them. Always beware of great words: MY country, motherland, fatherland, church, temple. BEWARE of all great words! They can drive you into an unconscious, robotlike behaviour.\nThis is now the greatest danger to human survival: the capacity for man to abandon his humanity, indeed, the inevitability that he does so as he merges his unique personality into larger institutional structures. It is not anger, violence, aggression, destructiveness, which is so dangerous, but the greatly valued idea of OBEDIENCE.\nIt is ironic that the virtues of loyalty, discipline and self-sacrifice that we value so highly in the individual are the very properties that create destructive organizational energies of war and that blind men to malevolent systems of authority.\nRemember, if we want to create a new humanity, we will have to reconsider the whole mind of man. The past has created a a very ugly mind – of course, with beautiful labels, with beautiful painted smiles, and behind is great animality.\nMy emphasis is on the individual not on the society, not on the nation, not on the religion. My emphasis is on the individual. The individual has to be freed from all kinds of social bondages and slaveries. That’s what sannyas is all about. Become aware... and out of your awareness, obedience is good, disobedience is good. But it HAS to be rooted in your awareness – then everything is good. And out of unawareness, obedience is bad, disobedience is bad.\nLet me remind you: I am not telling you to be disobedient, because if it is out of unawareness, and you say NO, it is as bad as saying yes. I am not teaching you disobedience, disorder, indiscipline. I am not doing that kind of thing at all. I can be misunderstood. I AM being misunderstood. What I am saying is: I am making you responsible.\nThe individual is TOTALLY responsible whatsoever he is doing. So you have to think, meditate, and act out of your meditations – and whatsoever you do will be virtuous, and whatsoever you do will be moral, and it will be a totally different kind of morality.\nThe last question Question 6\nBELOVED OSHO, THIS MORNING WHEN YOU TOLD THE STORY ABOUT THE TWO EIGHTY- YEAR-OLDS TALKING ON THE MORNING AFTER THEIR WEDDING NIGHT, I LET OUT A WHOOP OF LAUGHTER AT THE PUNCHLINE. REALIZING THAT I WAS OUT OF CONTROL, I CLASPED MY HAND OVER MY MOUTH AND CONTROLLED MYSELF: I CAN’T HELP IT. I LOVE TO LISTEN TO YOU TELL STORIES. I LOOK FORWARD TO THE NEXT ONE DURING DISCOURSE. AM I BEING FRIVOLOUS? SHOULD I BE MORE SERIOUS?\nAnand Bario,\nSERIOUSNESS IS ILLNESS. Seriousness is pathological. Be sincere, but never be serious. And sincerity is totally different. Seriousness is an assumed, pretended phenomenon; sincerity is of the heart. Sincerity is a kind of intensity in everything that you do.\nAnd it was good that you had a whoop of laughter! Now, hiding it behind your hands is phony, is pseudo. Let it be there! Laughter is good – good in every way: physically, psychologically, spiritually.\nAnd this is not being frivolous. We have been taught wrong things – that’s why people move with long faces in the world. We have been taught UTTERLY wrong things. Christians say Jesus never laughed. Why? And I know that he laughed, I know him perfectly well. But Christians were afraid: Jesus laughing will look frivolous. How can a saint laugh? The saint has to be with a long face. The saints come only with long faces. And, in fact, the man who has a long face can never be a saint.\nLaughter is something of a very superior quality. No other animal except man can laugh. If suddenly on the road you see a buffalo laughing... you will go mad. You will never be the same again! No other animal can laugh, except man. It is human dignity that man can laugh – it is human dignity, glory.\nLaughter is something spiritual. It belongs only to higher its of intelligence. The more intelligent you are. the more capable you are of laughing at things. Not only at things, but at yourself too. You become capable of seeing the whole grand absurdity of life, this great ridiculousness of life.\nChristians made Jesus look very sad. That’s why paintings of Jesus or sculptures of his face all look a little ugly. They don’t have that joy that is expressed by Krishna – his flute, his dance. They don’t have that laughter that you will see in Bodhidharma’s pictures, Lao Tzu’s pictures. They don’t have that superb quality that you will find in a genius like Chuang Tzu – the genius of the absurd.\nJesus must have laughed, because he was a very earthy man. He loved good food, he loved good company, he loved people. He ate well, and he was also a drunkard. Now, a drunkard and not laughing? – that is impossible. And he must have been telling jokes. Believe me! A drunkard and not telling jokes? The gospel writers must have dropped them. Even my editors sometimes feel that this is too much, unprintable! But I don’t allow them to drop anything.\nThe gospels were written after Jesus died, three hundred years afterwards, so the editors had absolute freedom to do whatsoever they wanted. I know beautiful jokes have been dropped. Jesus was a Jew – and Jews have the best jokes in the world.\nBario, don’t be worried about frivolousness. And sometimes even to be frivolous is beautiful. Even to be frivolous sometimes has a grandeur about it, a weightlessness, a beauty, a benediction. I accept life in all its colours, the whole rainbow: from frivolousness to sincerity.\nJust for you I will tell two jokes:\nFinkelstein’s father was very unhappy because his son regularly did the two things that a good Jew is not supposed to do: eat ham and go with non-Jewish women. Finally he complained to the rabbi.\n“Rabbi,” he cried, “I don’t know what to do. Whenever my son Ezra sees some ham, he immediately sinks his teeth into it, and when he sees a non-Jewish girl, he hugs and kisses her.”\nSo Ezra had to go and see the rabbi. “What is this your father tells me?” demanded the rabbi in a loud voice. “You sink your teeth into ham sandwiches and kiss Christian girls? What is the matter with you?”\n“Rabbi, what can I do?” said Ezra apologetically, “I’m crazy!”\n“Nonsense,” said the rabbi. “If you bit into the girl and kissed the ham sandwich – THEN you would be crazy! But as things are, everything is in order and you are perfectly normal. Just don’t do it any more!!”\nAnd the second:\nThere was this owner-operator of a bar who was constantly besieged with requests from his male customers for the names of prostitutes and their whereabouts.\nOne day he decided it was stupid not to tap into this source of income, so he went and got a couple of girls and installed them in a couple of rooms over the bar. Whenever a customer wanted a girl, he merely sent them upstairs.\nA couple of days after this new business began, a customer returned from upstairs very unhappy and complained to the man about the lousy blow-job he had just had.\nThe owner ordered the man to follow him back upstairs, called for the three girls who were working to gather in the bedroom, told the man to get back on the bed, turned to the girls and said, “Okay girls, I am going to show you HOW just ONE more time, so dammit, get it right!!”\nDon’t be worried about frivolousness – that is part of life. And a real life contains all; it has all the nuances, all the notes and all the colours. So, Bario, you can have a good laugh. No need to hide it. I would like my place to be a place of laughter, joy, festivity. I want to be a festival to you.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"9527","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/philosophia_perennis_vol_1/part3/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/philosophia_perennis_vol_1/>Philosophia Perennis, Vol 1</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">3 Falling Upwards</h1><div class=post-meta>45 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;9527 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Philosophia_Perennis_Vol_1/part3.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part2>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

UNDERSTANDING THE PURPOSELESSNESS OF EXISTENCE.</p><p><br></p><p>Deva Nirguna,</p><p><br></p><p>TRUTH ALWAYS TRIGGERS A PROCESS IN YOU, even if the truth is not your
own. The very hearing of it creates a parallel process in you. It is not
caused by hearing it; it follows not the law of cause and effect but the
law of synchronicity.</p><p><br></p><p>Listening to great music, music arises in you. There is no necessity:
it may arise, it may not arise. There is no inevitability about it. But
if you are open, it arises. If you are available, it arises. Watching a
great dancer, something starts dancing in you. This is communion.</p><p><br></p><p>The truth of Pythagoras, the truth of the greatest synthesis ever
attempted, CAN trigger a process in you, CAN start something so immense
that you could not have ever dreamt about it. That is the whole purpose
of satsang: being in communion with a Master. His presence, his
utterances, his silences, start working on you AND sometimes even in
spite of you. Sometimes you become aware of those processes, sometimes
you are not even aware of them; they start working underneath your
consciousness. One day they explode into great blossoming.</p><p>Pythagoras really has tried the impossible. And not only tried – he
succeeded too. But the world wants to live in division, because the
world can only understand conflict. It cannot understand synthesis.
Synthesis can be understood only when some synthesis inside you starts
happening; otherwise, synthesis is non-understandable, will be
misunderstood.</p><p><br></p><p>Everybody was against Pythagoras. All religions, all sects, all the
so-called gurus of those days, were against Pythagoras. In fact, they
should have been with him, because he was bringing all scattered
fragments of truth together. But it hurts.…</p><p><br></p><p>If I say the Koran is true, AS much true as the Vedas, if people were
understanding then Mohammedans and Hindus would both be tremendously
happy – but that doesn’t happen. Both become angry. The Mohammedan
becomes angry because I have compared HIS holy book with the ordinary
book – Vedas? And the Hindu becomes angry because I have compared HIS
holy book with an ordinary book – the Koran? They both become angry
because their egos are hurt.</p><p><br></p><p>And you can understand what must have happened to Pythagoras, because
it is happening to me, it is happening to you. The SAME process! Hindus
are against, Mohammedans are against, Jainas are against, Buddhists are
against, Christians are against. Why? And I am bringing Christ and
Buddha and Mahavira and Zarathustra and Lao Tzu and Krishna into the
highest possible synthesis. Still they are all against it.</p><p><br></p><p>The reason is: they are divided within themselves. They can only
understand THAT WHICH THEY ARE. YOU can never understand anything beyond
your consciousness. If YOU are split, you can only understand a split
world. If you are in a subtle harmony inside, then only will any harmony
happening outside be understood.</p><p><br></p><p>It is good, Nirguna, that you felt great gratitude arising in you
listening to the synthesis. It shows something has started becoming
integrated in you – something that is bringing you together, that is
creating a kind of unity between the two hemispheres of your brain, the
left and the right.</p><p><br></p><p>These two hemispheres of the brain have to be understood, and very
deeply – because much depends on that. Now scientists are also in deep
agreement with the ancient mystic lore, that unless these two brains are
bridged and bridged rightly, a man remains schizophrenic. They ARE
bridged, but in a very very small way; just a small thread bridges them.
That thread can be cut.</p><p><br></p><p>Sometimes it happens in an accident, in a car accident, for example –
the bridge may be damaged. It is a very delicate bridge, JUST like a
thread. Once it is cut, the person becomes two persons: one person
becomes two persons. He starts behaving like two persons. And strange
things have been observed.</p><p><br></p><p>For example: the left side of the brain is able to read and to
remember. The right side of the brain is not able to read at all. So a
strange thing happens: you can give the person something to read, he
will read it, but only one part of his brain will remember it. If you
anaesthetize his left side, he will not even remember that he has read
anything. He HAS read something, but he will not remember.</p><p><br></p><p>His one hand may be doing something, but the other hand will not
cooperate, because those two hands belong to different hemispheres. The
right hand belongs to the left hemisphere. That’s why</p><p>the right hand has become so important. The right has become the
RIGHT hand, and the left hand has become the wrong hand. Why? It is very
symbolic.</p><p><br></p><p>The left hand is connected with the right hemisphere, and the right
hemisphere represents intuition, psychic powers, meditation, love,
poetry – because ALL these things are condemned, the left hand is
condemned. The right hand represents logic, calculation, arithmetic,
science – because these things are praised, the right hand is
praised.</p><p><br></p><p>Ten percent of children are born lefthanded; out of ten, one person
is lefthanded. You may not be able to find so many lefthanded people,
because from the very beginning we start forcing them to write with the
right hand, to do things with the right hand. This is destroying a
minority. This is very oppressive, because the person who is born
lefthanded has to be lefthanded if he is ever to be an authentic person.
He will become phony. You will force him to use the right hand and
because all are rightists – the teacher, the parents, other students in
the school – he will feel guilty if he uses the left hand. He is doing
something wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>He is NOT doing ANYTHING wrong – he is naturally a leftist. He has
the capacity to become a poet. He has the capacity to become an
intuitive person. He may develop prophetic powers. He may be able to
read other people’s thoughts one day. He may be able to become a great
hypnotic medium. He may even be able to have power of mind over matter.
He has IMMENSE capacities! but he is crushed.</p><p><br></p><p>The society forces him to move to the right hand. The right hand is
his weak hand. He will live a very weak life, unfertile, uncreative. He
may have become a great seer; now he will live just as a third-rate
mathematician. The person may have been a first-rate poet, or a
musician, or a painter; now he will be just a third-rate clerk in some
office, or a station-master, or a deputy collector, or a politician –
something third-rate. You have been very very violent with him.</p><p><br></p><p>These two hemispheres are very slightly bridged; a little
communication happens ordinarily. The more one becomes integrated, the
deeper the communication that starts happening between these two
hemispheres. In a Buddha those two hemispheres become one. He is AS
logical as one can be and AS loving as one can be.</p><p><br></p><p>The left hemisphere, which is connected with the right hand, is under
the law of necessity. And the right hemisphere, which is connected with
the left hand, is under the law of power. And if both these laws become
one, LOGOS arises, DHAMMA arises, TAO, TORAH, arises – the ultimate law,
the law of laws. Then the man has a tremendous beauty and grace. He is
the meeting of the earth and the sky, of man and woman; he is the
meeting of all that is divided in existence. And in THAT meeting, God is
known.</p><p><br></p><p>All the secret methods of all the mystery schools are nothing but
alchemical processes to create a bridge between these two hemispheres,
to bring them SO close, so utterly close, that they almost become one.
When logic functions as love, love functions as logic, you have attained
to the highest peak. At that peak, ecstasy simply happens – just as when
spring comes, flowers start blossoming. When that synthesis, that
spring, has happened in your inner world, you have come home, you have
attained the one, the whole. You have become holy.</p><p>Nirguna, something is happening in you, as something is happening to
all of my sannyasins. In those who are really close to me, those who are
not just formally sannyasins, those who are really in love with me,
those who have really said a YES to me, without any NO hiding behind it,
this synthesis is happening. East and West ARE meeting, the sky and the
earth ARE meeting, mind and matter are meeting.</p><p><br></p><p>What Pythagoras did was destroyed. His whole academy, his whole
school, was burnt. Hundreds of his disciples were massacred. We are
trying to do it again, we are taking the risk again – the danger is
there. The same can be our fate too. But it need not be. We can learn
something from Pythagoras’ experiment. He was the first pioneer. He HAD
succeeded in his life; he had succeeded with many of his disciples. But
maybe he had come too early; the world was not yet ready.</p><p><br></p><p>Now the world is scientifically ready. That time the world was not
scientifically ready. East was East and West was West, and the bridge
was almost impossible. Now science has brought people so close to each
other that this is the climate in which spiritually also a synthesis is
possible. At that time people were isolated. Once in a while a visitor
might come from the West to the East... and remember, it was always a
visitor from the West to the East; it was never a visitor from the East
to the West. Why?</p><p><br></p><p>The West represents the male mind: it takes initiative. The East
represents the female mind: it simply waits, it takes no initiative. It
is like a man always proposes to the woman and says “I love you.” It is
never the woman who proposes. And if a woman proposes to you, you would
like to escape from her because she is not a woman; she has more of a
male mind. You will become afraid. You will be offended. You will not be
able to take it easily. The woman has to wait.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why the West has always been sending feelers to the East. The
East has simply waited; it has not gone anywhere. Once in a while a
visitor may come. He will take with him the ancient lore of the East to
the West, and he will always be misunderstood. It happened with
Pythagoras, and after five hundred years it happened with Jesus.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus had also been a visitor to the East; he learnt all in the East.
And when he went back, he was not understood either; it was too foreign.
The SAME way it is happening to my sannyasins: when you go to the West
you are going to be misunderstood. But you are in a better position –
you are so many. A Pythagoras came alone, went back alone; a Jesus came
alone, went back alone. They were great adventurers.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus was killed. Pythagoras’ academy was burnt, his disciples
massacred. I he world was not yet so closely knit as it is today.
Science and technology have brought people very close. All the barriers,
at least the physical barriers, are re moved. Now the second step can be
taken: psychological barriers can be removed – that’s what we are doing
here.</p><p><br></p><p>It is good that the Pythagorean synthesis struck a chord in your
heart, because that s my work too. And the second thing, Nirguna. you
say:</p><p>GREAT JOY ARISES IN UNDERSTANDING THE PURPOSELESSNESS OF
EXISTENCE.</p><p>JOY ARISES only when you understand that the whole cannot have any
purpose. Parts can have purpose: the whole cannot have any purpose.</p><p><br></p><p>Your house has a purpose: it is a shelter for you. a safety for you.
The food has a purpose: it nourishes you, it keeps you alive. Your
clothes are purposeful. your machines... and everything that you create
is purposeful. But what purpose do you have?</p><p><br></p><p>Now you start moving into the world of purposelessness. Still a few
things you can find. You can say, “I am here to be happy.” But what
purpose is there in being happy? What purpose does happiness have? You
may say, “I am here to love.” But then love in itself is purposeless. It
is AS purposeless as a roseflower, as a dewdrop slipping on the lotus
leaf in the early morning sun. It is AS purposeless as the whole.</p><p><br></p><p>The closer you come to the whole, the more purposelessness becomes
the law. Purpose belongs to the law of necessity: purposelessness
belongs to the law of power. What is the purpose of the whole? No
purpose at all – it is a sheer celebration. That’s why Hindus have
called it LEELA – LEELA means a playfulness. It is just a play.</p><p><br></p><p>Play has no purpose. The moment play becomes purposeful it becomes a
game, remember – that is the difference between play and game. If you
are simply playing cards with no stake, with no money involved, it is a
play. The moment you stake money, it is no more play – it is business.
Purpose has entered. It is a game. Now you are gambling. Just a few
moments before you were playing; now playing has become secondary. Now
the question is how to succeed in getting more money. The thing has
become serious; it is no longer weightless. It has fallen from the world
of grace into the world of gravitation. It has fallen from the world of
power into the world of necessity.</p><p><br></p><p>These two laws are tremendously beautiful. The law of necessity is
equivalent to the law of gravitation. Science has recognized the law of
gravitation, the law of necessity. Science has not yet recognized the
higher law: the law of grace, the law of power. That’s why science goes
on thinking in terms of cause and effect. It is still unaware of a
higher law.</p><p><br></p><p>Religion has discovered the higher law – the law of grace.
Gravitation pulls you down... now this should be meditated over. If
there is birth, there is death – to counterbalance it. If there is love,
there is hate. If there is negative electricity, there is positive
electricity. If there is a law that pulls things down, there MUST be a
law that pulls things up.</p><p><br></p><p>It is simple logic! It need not be proved. It is VERY simple: in life
everything is balanced by its polar opposite. So where is the polar
opposite of gravitation? I ask. There must be one. And remember, even
gravitation was not known before Newton; just for three hundred years we
have known it. And it is not that the law of gravitation started
functioning after Newton – it was functioning tor ever! Newton did not
invent it: he only discovered it. And now the discovery looks very
ordinary.</p><p><br></p><p>Newton sitting under a tree, and an apple falls, and he contemplates
over it: “Why does the apple always fall downwards? Why not sometimes
upwards? or to the right? or to the left? Just going in any
direction.<span class=s4></span>Why does it always come downwards?”
And something clicked in his mind, that</p><p>there must be some power that pulls it towards the earth. But apples
have been falling always! Before Newton too. Apples don’t bother whether
Newton has discovered the law or not. Apples have simply been falling
without knowing any science of falling.</p><p>And exactly the same has been happening with the law of grace. There
have been people who have been falling upwards. A Buddha, a Jesus, a
Pythagoras – these people have fallen upwards. They KNOW that something
pulls up – if you allow. If you simply become effortless, if you DON’T
do a thing, if you surrender, if you trust, something starts taking you
upwards, you start levitating – not physically: spiritually. Something
in you starts rising higher and higher and higher and reaches to the
ultimate peak of consciousness. Just as the apple falls downwards, you
start falling upwards.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a famous Sufi parable:</p><p><br></p><p>A Sufi mystic who was known as a madman.… Many mystics have been
known as madmen. They ARE in a sense. The world thinks they are mad,
because they follow something utterly absurd in the eyes of the world.
The world accumulates money, the world is in search of more and more
power and prestige, and they are simply not concerned with these great
things. The world wants to possess and have more and more. And there
have been people who are not worried about having more and more.
Certainly they look mad. They don’t have a thing to their name...
remember Diogenes, not having a thing to his name, but still happier
than Alexander the Great, utterly joyous. Even Alexander the Great had
felt jealous. It is said that he said to Diogenes, “If next time I have
to come into the world, I will ask God, ‘This time please make me
Diogenes. I don’t want to become Alexander the Great again.”’ Must have
felt very jealous of Diogenes, the naked madman.</p><p><br></p><p>But what did Diogenes say? He laughed and he said, “If I have another
chance to come into the world, I cannot ask to be made Alexander the
Great – because I am not stupid. And why do you want to wait for another
life? You can become Diogenes right now, because to become an Alexander
great effort is needed: to become a Diogenes no effort is needed. You
can become immediately!” He said, “Throw you; clothes! Lie down by my
side! I am taking a sunbath, you take one also. And forget all about
conquering the world... you are a Diogenes THIS very moment!”</p><p><br></p><p>These people will look mad. He USED to look mad. Diogenes used to
carry a lamp in full daylight. And whenever he met a person, he would
take his lamp up and look into his face – in full daylight! And people
would ask, “What are you doing?” And he would say, “I am searching for a
man – I have not come across him yet.”</p><p><br></p><p>And do you know what happened when he was dying? Somebody asked
Diogenes, “Your whole life you have been searching for a real man. even
in full daylight with a lamp – did you find him?”</p><p><br></p><p>Diogenes opened his eyes and he said, “No, but I am dying happy – at
least nobody has stolen my lamp yet.”</p><p><br></p><p>These people will look mad. The story, the Sufi story, says:</p><p>A mad Sufi mystic stayed in the house of a disciple. The disciple was
a little worried because this man was known to do strange things: “He
may do something and may create some nuisance. And the neighbourhood and
the people, what will they think? They will think that I am also mad, to
be a disciple of such a mad man.”</p><p>And it was known that even in the middle of the night he would start
singing, shouting, or dancing, out of joy. So the disciple thought, “It
will be better to keep him locked in the basement, so at least he
doesn’t start doing something in the middle of the night.” So he locked
him in the basement.</p><p><br></p><p>And just in the middle of the night, it started happening – great
rejoicing! shouting and dancing. And he was more puzzled because he
heard him dancing on the roof! He rushed upwards. He asked, “But how did
you manage? How did you come to the roof?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “What can I do? I opened my eyes and I saw I was falling
upwards.”</p><p><br></p><p>This is a beautiful story – falling upwards. There is a law of
falling upwards. And sometimes when you meditate, dance, sing, you will
feel it: being possessed by something higher, from the above. And you
are taken to higher plenitudes than you have ever known before.</p><p><br></p><p>That is the law of grace, or the law of power.</p><p><br></p><p>And when you can use both the worlds<span class=s4></span>One
belongs to science, one belongs to religion. And the</p><p>world is waiting for a NEW way of looking at things, in which science
and religion will become one. Call it ‘religio-science’ or call it
‘science-religion’ – but the world is waiting for SOMETHING that will
make these two laws function as one in a great synthesis.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what I mean when I say that I would like my sannyasins to be
like Zorba the Greek and Gautam the Buddha – both together. My effort
here is to create Zorba the Buddha.</p><p><br></p><p>The second question Question 2</p><p>OSHO, I LOVE THE WAY YOUR HANDS MOVE AND DANCE GRACEFULLY WHILE YOU
ARE TALKING TO US. I FEEL INTOXICATED WITH YOUR HANDS AND THEIR
EXPRESSIVE MOVEMENTS. WHAT IS THE SECRET OF YOUR HANDS?</p><p><br></p><p>THERE IS NO SECRET – I am just an old ancient Jew. And habits die
hard.</p><p>It was a morning in December, and the air was bitter cold. Two Jews
were walking down the sidewalk, and one of the pair, amid great puffs of
steaming breath, was talking and gesticulating earnestly. The other,
however, remained silent. Finally the first Jew paused in his discourse
long enough to say, “Well, Moe, don’t you agree with me, what I
say?”</p><p><br></p><p>To which Moe replied, “Ikey, you can talk all you want, but I am
going to keep my hands in my pockets.”</p><p><br></p><p>The third question Question 3</p><p>WHAT IS THE DE-ACTIVATION PROCESS OF THE LAW OF NECESSITY AND THE
ACTIVATION PROCESS OF THE LAW OF POWER?</p><p><br></p><p>Anurag,</p><p><br></p><p>THE LAW OF NECESSITY means you are unconscious, you are functioning
like a robot. Only then does the law of necessity apply. So if you want
to de-activate the law of necessity, the only way is to become more
aware, more alert.</p><p><br></p><p>De-automatize your activities. Walking, walk with aware ness. Eating,
eat with awareness. In the beginning it is very difficult, because you
have always lived in unconsciousness. You walk mechanically – bring
awareness to walking. And to bring awareness to walking, a few things
will be needed.</p><p><br></p><p>One: don’t walk at the usual pace you walk – go slower. Go AS slow as
you can, because if you go slower than you usually go, your old habit
cannot persist. You are bringing something new into it and the body will
have to get adjusted. It will take time, and that time can be used to
become aware.</p><p><br></p><p>If you smoke cigarettes, go VERY slowly, take time. Take the packet
of cigarettes VERY slowly from your pocket, as slowly as possible. Be in
slow motion. And then slowly take a cigarette out, VERY slowly, as if
you have no energy... and you are BOUND to be aware! Then tap the
cigarette on the packet, AS slowly as possible, as if you are almost
dead, and go on doing it for a longer time. Then very slowly put it in
your mouth. Then wait! Don’t be in a hurry. Then bring your lighter...
and the same, slow... take time. Smoke one cigarette in one hour. And
you will be surprised how much awareness arises in you.</p><p><br></p><p>And you will also be surprised to know: the moment you lose
awareness, you fall back into the old fast motion. Slow down.…</p><p><br></p><p>That’s the whole process of vipassana. In vipassana you have to do
two kinds of meditation: one is sitting, zazen; another is walking. WALK
slowly<span class=s4></span>It can be done in any way. Just breathe
slowly,</p><p>and breathing becomes a meditation. Let your hand move very slowly
from one side to the other. And you will be aware.</p><p><br></p><p>Make your activities de-automatized. And the more aware you are, the
more the law of necessity starts disappearing. And when there is no law
of necessity functioning, the other law functions automatically, of its
own accord – the law of power.</p><p><br></p><p>It is said:</p><p><br></p><p>One day a great astrologer was coming back from Kashi. He had been
learning astrology for twenty years in Kashi; he had become very famous.
Now he was going back to his home town.</p><p><br></p><p>Passing a river, on the soft, wet sand, he saw a few footprints<span class=s4></span>he could not believe his eves! “Those</p><p>footprints can only be of a man who is the ruler of the whole world!”
That’s what his astrological books had been telling him for twenty
years. The ruler of the whole world has a special name in India – he is
called CHAKRAVARTIN – whose rule is on all the six continents. “What is
a Chakravartin</p><p>doing in this poor village? Naked, barefoot, in the hot sun, on the
bank of this small and dirty river? Impossible!”</p><p><br></p><p>A great doubt arose in the astrologer: “Are my books wrong?” He
studied the footprint very well; ALL the symptoms were there. He
followed those footprints in search of this man... and he came across
Buddha sitting under a tree.</p><p><br></p><p>Now there was even more difficulty. The man looked like a great
emperor: his grace, his beauty, and the silence that surrounded him, and
the festivity that was around. Just by his presence, the tree was
glowing, the rock he was sitting on was glowing. “He IS a Chakravartin!
But he looks like a beggar too, with a begging bowl.”</p><p><br></p><p>He fell at the feet of Buddha and asked, “You have puzzled me very
much. Should I throw my books? Twenty years I have wasted! Can I look at
your feet?”</p><p><br></p><p>He looked at Buddha’s feet and he said, “Now it is absolutely
certain: you should be a Chakravartin! – the greatest emperor in the
world, the emperor of emperors. What are you doing here? I don’t even
see a servant around you. And what is this begging bowl, and these old
clothes you are wearing? Are you a beggar?”</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha laughed and he said, “Don’t throw your books – they are right,
but they are right only for the people who live under the law of
necessity, those who live unconsciously. Once a person becomes
conscious, he goes beyond astrology and astrological predictions. Then
the law of necessity no longer applies to him. Then he is part of the
infinite power then he is part of God – he IS a God. He lives in a
totally different way . You cannot predict him; he is unpredictable.</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t throw your books. You will not come across a man like me again
in your life. Don’t be worried. It rarely happens – very rarely it
happens that a person is born as a Charkravartin; very rarely it happens
that a person becomes a Buddha. And, of course, absolutely rare is the
case when a Chakravartin becomes a Buddha. A Chakravartin in himself is
rare; a Buddha in himself is rare – and the combination of a
Chakravartin becoming a Buddha is absolutely rare. You will not come
across such a person again in this life, or in MANY lives, so don’t be
worried. I am an exception – and the exception proves the rule. You can
follow your books, you can take your books, and you will ALWAYS be
right. It is only this once that you have been wrong.”</p><p><br></p><p>Become conscious, Anurag. The more conscious you are, the more you
are beyond prediction. Then you live EACH MOMENT in freedom – power
means freedom. Power means free from the past karma. Power means you are
no more dominated by the past. The past has no more power over you. Your
each moment is free from the past moment. Your each moment is fresh,
young, virgin. You LIVE it in total freedom! but it never creates a
bondage for the moment that will be following it. Your each moment
remains unpolluted, pure, crystal-clear.</p><p><br></p><p>And to live in the law of necessity is to live in bondage. That’s
what is meant by SAMSARA – the bondage, imprisoned. That is the whole
meaning of the law of karma. In fact, the idea that Pythagoras got of
the law of necessity is from the law of karma; that is his way of
expressing it. The law of karma says: Whatever you have done in the past
is still dominating you. You are possessed by the dead past; you are
manipulated by the dead past. Whatsoever you have done yesterday has</p><p>become a pattern, a structure, a character, and you are simply
repeating it today. By repeating it, you will be enforcing it. Tomorrow
it will become stronger, and the day after tomorrow even stronger. And
life after life if you go on repeating a certain thing, it creates
grooves in your mind – and then it becomes an absolute necessity. You
simply live like a robot.</p><p>Gurdjieff used to say that man is a machine. It is true. Unless you
become a Buddha, you are a machine. What does the word ‘Buddha’ mean?
‘Buddha’ means one who is awakened, aware.</p><p>Become aware. The man of awareness has no character. You will be
surprised: I say the man of awareness is characterless – not in the
sense that you give to the word ‘characterless’, but in a totally
different sense he is characterless. Because he has no past to dominate
him, no structure, no pattern. He is pure freedom. He is innocent. He
responds to the moment, with no ready-made responses, because if a
response is ready-made it is not a response at all: it is a reaction. He
mirrors the moment as it is, and in that mirroring, he acts.</p><p>The unconscious person reacts: the conscious person acts. And if you
can act consciously, TOTALLY in the moment, you don’t create any karma,
you don’t create any structures. You always remain free; you always go
on moving beyond the past. You go on slipping out of the past like a
snake slips out of the old skin.</p><p>Then life has tremendous beauty – because then there is power. And it
is not YOUR power, so there is no question of any ego trip. Ego comes
from the past; it is part of the law of necessity. Ego is your
character, good or bad, but ego is the prison that keeps you in bondage.
Ego arises out of your whole past.</p><p>Just think for a moment: if you have no past, who are you? Suddenly
the whole edifice of the ego collapses. The man of power is not really
powerful in his own right: he is just a vehicle for the power of God. He
has no claims. He simply functions as a representative of the whole. He
is utter freedom, utter joy. He knows no boundaries, he is infinite.
Space and time are no more relevant to him. He is beyond space, beyond
time.</p><p>That is the meaning of being enlightened. Disappearing as a
character, disappearing as a person, disappearing as an ego... and
becoming one with the whole: UNIO MYSTICA. That mystic union... and you
are no more there, and God is. And God is power.</p><p>The bridge from necessity to power is consciousness. Anurag, become
more and more conscious in whatsoever you are doing. And it is your
birthright to enter into the world of power, into the radiant world of
power, the luminous world of power.</p><p>The fourth question Question 4</p><p>OSHO, IS THE TIME RIPE FOR ME TO BECOME A SANNYASIN? CAN I ASK WHEN
THE TIME IS RIPE?</p><p>IT HAPPENED ON A JOURNEY BY SHIP: the parrot felt terribly bored and
was really happy when one day he discovered that there was also a monkey
on board. To pass the time the parrot said, “Let’s play
hide-and-seek.”</p><p>The monkey said, “I don’t know this game. How does it go?”</p><p><br></p><p>So the parrot explained, “It is very simple. You close your eyes,
face a wall and count to a hundred. In the meantime I hide and when you
reach one hundred you start looking for me.”</p><p><br></p><p>So they did.</p><p><br></p><p>But it happened that the ship exploded at the same moment that the
monkey reached one hundred. The parrot managed to find a plank floating
in the sea. After a while he saw the monkey as he swam towards the plank
totally exhausted. When the monkey had climbed up he looked at the
parrot and said, “What a stupid game!”</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever you feel life as a stupid game, it is time for sannyas. The
fifth question</p><p>Question 5</p><p><br></p><p>CAN YOU SAY SOMETHING MORE ABOUT OBEDIENCE? IS IT NOT GOOD TO SERVE
OBEDIENTLY IN A NOBLE CAUSE?</p><p><br></p><p>AWARENESS IS THE ONLY VIRTUE WITH ME REMEMBER. If you serve with
awareness, it is Good. If you serve in an unconscious way, it is bad. It
is not a question of a noble cause. If you are unconscious, even a noble
cause is going to be very ignoble. It is the consciousness that you
bring to it that matters.</p><p><br></p><p>You can look in the history books: all kinds of mischief have
continued on the earth in the name of noble causes. Christians.
Mohammedans, Hindus, have been fighting, destroying each other – for
noble causes. Communists, socialists, fascists, have been bringing more
and more violence into the world and more and more murder – for noble
causes.</p><p><br></p><p>Do you think Adolf Hitlers cause was not noble? If it had not been
noble, how could a very intelligent race like the Germans have followed
him? And remember that the Germans are one of the most intelligent races
on the world-map. This age’s four great minds who have dominated the
whole world, all have come from Germany. Friedrich Nietzsche, Sigmund
Freud, Karl Marx, Albert Einstein – these are the four great names of
our times. They all came from the German mind, from German sources.</p><p><br></p><p>How could such an intelligent people follow this stupid megalomaniac,
Adolf Hitler? In the name of a noble cause. The noble cause was: the
world is in chaos and the world has to be dominated and ruled by the
noble people, by the Aryans. Do you know? – the word ‘arya’ means noble.
The world has to be dominated and ruled by the noblest of the noble.</p><p><br></p><p>ARYA IS a Sanskrit word. It means the noblest. Now, behind the word
‘noble’, Adolf Hitler was hiding all kinds of ugly things. And thousands
and thousands of intelligent people followed him, obediently – because
the cause was noble! Millions of Jews were burnt – in the name of a
noble cause – millions suffered in concentration camps. And the people
who were torturing them were</p><p>not unintelligent people, were VERY efficient and intelligent people.
And they were doing their duty, obediently, for a noble cause.</p><p><br></p><p>What happened in Russia? Joseph Stalin, another man of the same type
as Adolf Hitler, murdered and butchered millions of people – again in
the name of a noble cause: Communism has to be established, and any
sacrifice is not too much. If communism, the paradise, the classless
society, can arrive on the earth, then no sacrifice is too much.</p><p><br></p><p>And the same has been happening down the ages: the Christian
crusades, the Mohammedan JEHADS – wars of religion to SAVE religion. Of
course, when Islam is in danger it has to be saved, and the people who
are creating the danger have to be destroyed – in the name of a noble
cause. When Christianity is in danger, then everything is allowed. And
who decides when Islam is in danger? Who decides when Christianity is in
danger? Who decides who is an Aryan and who is not?</p><p><br></p><p>Jews think they are the chosen people of God, and Adolf Hitler thinks
Nordics, the purest Aryans, are the chosen people of God. Now there
cannot live two people who think that they are the chosen people of God:
one has to be destroyed, the competitor has to be destroyed. Look at the
whole inhuman history of humanity and you will always find it is
obedience to noble causes that has caused immense misery, that has made
the whole life of humanity a nightmare.</p><p><br></p><p>You ask me: IS IT NOT GOOD TO SERVE OBEDIENTLY IN A NOBLE CAUSE?</p><p><br></p><p>No. Serve only with awareness. Obey only with awareness. Obedience
should NOT be for something exterior. Obedience should be something
interior. You should be able to see what is at stake. And you will be
able to say yes or no according to your own conscience. Only then can
the world become a little better, a little more human.</p><p><br></p><p>The people who dropped the atom bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki – just
two persons! – they could have said no. It was so obvious that the one
hundred thousand people who lived in Hiroshima were utterly innocent –
small children, women, old people. Why drop an atom bomb that would
destroy them immediately, within seconds? Within ten seconds Hiroshima
was a dead city. Just ten seconds before, it was alive. It was time...
people were taking their breakfast, people were singing, people were
doing ALL kinds of things. Just a few seconds before, all was so alive.
And after just a few moments, the whole of Hiroshima was just a cemetery
– all dead people.</p><p><br></p><p>The person who dropped the bomb could have said no, but he was
obediently serving a noble cause. What was the noble cause? – democracy.
These big words are very dangerous, because behind them you can hide
anything. Now in the name of democracy, capitalism hides itself. And in
the name of equality, communism hides itself. Watch all big words, and
whenever a politician uses a big word, be aware – there must be
something fishy about it.</p><p><br></p><p>And don’t go on following. It is better to die... if the man who was
going to drop the atom bomb had said NO, it is possible he would have
been court-martialled. So what? He could have said, “You kill me – that
seems to be a lesser evil. I would like to die” – and that would have
been a noble cause! – “You shoot me, but I simply say no. I will not
drop this atom bomb on innocent people.”</p><p>The people who were destroying poor Vietnam could have said no. And
the same is continuously repeated everywhere, all around the globe. Now
it is time we should become more aware.</p><p><br></p><p>Obedience has been exploited. Obedience has been a very subtle
strategy of the politician and the priest. If it comes out of your
awareness, if you see that this is good – not that your leaders, your
politicians, your priests, say it is good, but you feel it is good, it
has to be your response – then do it by all means. But if you see...
your individual conscience has to decide. That’s my whole point: each
individual has to create his own consciousness and conscience – only
then will we be able to create a better world. Otherwise, this world is
going to commit suicide within twenty-five years.</p><p><br></p><p>By the end of this century, this foolish idea of obedience to noble
causes is going to destroy the whole of humanity, and not only humanity
– with humanity, all life on this earth, all trees, all birds, all
animals – all kinds of life. And there are millions of kinds of life on
this earth. This earth is a festival.</p><p><br></p><p>If you go on carrying this stupid idea that has been put into your
mind down the ages... throughout the ages, you have been fed this idea
with your mother’s milk: Obey! I teach you awareness. And, of course,
out of awareness a totally different kind of obedience arises. Then you
say yes because your heart says yes. and if your heart says no, then say
no, and risk all for your no. That is human dignity.</p><p><br></p><p>ARTHUR KOESTLER WRITES ABOUT AN EXPERIMENT. Meditate over it:</p><p><br></p><p>A series of highly original experiments was started by Doctor Stanley
Milgram. The purpose of the experiments was to discover the limits of
the average person’s obedience to authority when ordered to inflict
severe pain on an innocent victim in the interests of a noble cause.</p><p><br></p><p>The noble cause was education. It involved three people: the
professor, who was the authority figure in charge of the proceedings;
the learner or victim; and the experimental subject, who was asked by
the professor to act as teacher and to punish the learner each time he
gave the wrong reply. Punishment was by electric shocks of growing
severity, administered by the teacher on the professor’s orders. The
learner or victim was strapped into a kind of electric chair. The
teacher was seated in front of an impressive shock-generator which had a
key-board of thirty switches ranging from fifteen volts to four hundred
and fifty volts. There were also verbal inscriptions on the machine
ranging from ‘slight shock’ to ‘intense shock’ to ‘danger: severe
shock’.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, the whole gruesome set-up was based on make-believe: the
victim was an actor, the shock- generator was a dummy. Only the teacher,
at whom the experiment was aimed, believed in the reality of the shocks
he was ordered to administer and of the shrieks of pain and cries for
mercy uttered by the victim.</p><p><br></p><p>The basic procedure was as follows: the learner was given to read a
long list of paired words, that is ‘blue box’, ‘nice day’, ‘wild duck’,
etc. Then in the examination he was given one test word, for instance,
‘blue’, with four alternative answers, that is ‘ink, box, sky, lamp’,
and had to indicate which was the correct answer. The teacher was
instructed by the professor to administer a shock each time the learner
gave a wrong response, and moreover to move one level higher on the
shock generator each time the learner gave the wrong answer. There was a
fifteen volt increment from one switch to the next.</p><p>To make sure that the teacher was aware of what he was doing, the
actor who played the role of the learner uttered complaints which
increased in stridency according to the voltage, from mild grunts
starting at seventy-five volts, in a crescendo, until at one hundred and
fifty volts the victim cried out, “Get me out of here! I won’t be in the
experiment any more. I refuse to go on!”</p><p><br></p><p>Remember that the teacher believed that the victim too was a
volunteer.</p><p><br></p><p>At three hundred and fifteen volts, after a violent scream, the
victim reaffirmed vehemently that he was no longer a participant. He
provided no answers, but screamed in agony whenever a shock was
administered. After three hundred and thirty volts he was not heard
from... yet the professor instructed the subject to treat no answer as a
wrong answer, and to continue to increase the shock level according to
the schedule. After three shocks of four hundreds and fifty volts, he
called off the experiment.</p><p><br></p><p>How many people, in an average population, do you think would obey
the command to carry on with the task of torturing the victim to the
limit of four hundred and fifty volts? The answer seems to be a foregone
conclusion: perhaps one in a thousand – a pathological sadist.</p><p><br></p><p>Before starting his experiments, Milgram actually asked a group of
psychiatrists to predict the outcome. With remarkable similarity, they
predicted that virtually all subjects would refuse to obey the
experimenter. The consensus of the psychiatrists was that most subjects
would not go beyond one hundred and fifty volts, that is when the victim
asks for the first time to be released. They expected that only four
percent would reach three hundred volts, and that only a pathological
fringe of about one in a thousand would administer the highest shock on
the board.</p><p><br></p><p>In actual fact, over sixty percent of the subjects continued to obey
the professor to the very end – the four hundred and fifty volt limit.
Remember: sixty percent.</p><p><br></p><p>When the experiment was repeated in Italy, South Africa and
Australia. the percent of obedient subjects was somewhat higher. In
Munich it was eighty-five percent.</p><p><br></p><p>The act of shocking the victim does not stem from destructive urges,
but from the fact that the subjects have become integrated into a social
system which is based on obedience. To prove this point, Milgram carried
on a further series of experiments in which the teacher was told that he
was free to inflict on the learner ANY shock level of his own choice on
any of the trials. Though given full opportunity, almost all subjects
administered the lowest shocks, the mean shock level being fifty-four
volts.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember that the victim’s first mild complaint came only at
seventy-five volts.</p><p><br></p><p>In the original experiments, when the teacher acted on orders, an
average of twenty-five out of forty subjects administered the maximum
shock of four hundred and fifty volts. In the free-choice experiment,
thirty-eight out of forty did not go beyond one hundred and fifty volts
– victim’s first loud protest – and only two subjects went up to three
hundred and twenty-five and four hundred and fifty respectively</p><p><br></p><p>The vast majority of the subjects, far from deriving any pleasure
from shocking the victim, showed various symptoms of emotional strain
and distress. Some broke into a sweat, others pleaded with the</p><p>professor to stop, or protested that the experiment was cruel and
stupid. Yet two-thirds nevertheless went on to the bitter end.</p><p><br></p><p>We have been taught for centuries to obey – and to obey in the noble
cause is a virtue; to disobey is a vice, is a sin. Disobeying any noble
cause will create guilt in you. Obeying will make you feel good. AND YOU
may even be obeying it in spite of your own conscience. You will see the
futility, the stupidity, the cruelty of it.</p><p><br></p><p>The man who dropped the bomb on Hiroshima slept very well that night,
and in the morning when he was asked how he was feeling, he said,
“Perfect!” People could not believe it. They said, “Could you sleep in
the night? One hundred thousand people have been burnt by you – could
you sleep in the night?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I slept VERY well, because I had done my duty. And when one
does one’s duty well, one earns a good sleep.”</p><p><br></p><p>Truman was the President of the United States when the atom bomb was
dropped. When he was asked, “How do you feel?” he said, “I feel great! A
noble cause has been served – democracy has won over fascist
forces.”</p><p><br></p><p>Remember always: big words are very dangerous. And big words have a
very hypnotic power in them: democracy, God, religion, Bible... great
words have a VERY hypnotic power over you. They can create a great
unconsciousness in you, and you can go on doing things which you would
have never even dreamt of doing without those big words.</p><p><br></p><p>So remember, ‘noble cause’ is a very dangerous game. Who decides what
is noble? Let EACH individual decide according to his own
conscience.</p><p><br></p><p>And why in Munich was the percentage the highest? – eighty-five
percent. Because Germans are very obedient. That has been their
training, that has been their conditioning – and they have been praised
for it. That has become part and parcel of their inner mechanism.</p><p><br></p><p>The disappearance of a sense of responsibility is the most
far-reaching consequence of submission to authority.</p><p><br></p><p>It is very easy to dispense with your responsibility. You can always
say, “What can I do? – I have been ordered.” And the higher person can
say he has been ordered from a higher authority, and so on and so forth.
Even the President can say, “I have been advised by the military
experts.” And so on and on, round and round it goes. Nobody is REALLY
responsible. Responsibility can always be shoved on somebody else’s
shoulders.</p><p><br></p><p>And a really religious person is a responsible person. He says, “I am
responsible. If I am doing something, then I am responsible, and I have
to think it over, whether to do it or not. If my OWN awareness allows
it, I will do it; otherwise, whatsoever the consequences, I AM GOING TO
DISOBEY.”</p><p><br></p><p>So obedience is not a value to me at all, neither is disobedience a
disvalue. Your own understanding is the value. OUT of that, obedience is
good; OUT of that, disobedience is also good.</p><p>Morality does not disappear, but acquires a totally different
meaning: the subordinate person feels shame and pride depending on how
adequately he has performed the actions called for by authority.
Language provides numerous terms to pinpoint this type of morality:
loyalty, duty, discipline, obedience.…</p><p><br></p><p>Great words! Beware of them. Always beware of great words: MY
country, motherland, fatherland, church, temple. BEWARE of all great
words! They can drive you into an unconscious, robotlike behaviour.</p><p><br></p><p>This is now the greatest danger to human survival: the capacity for
man to abandon his humanity, indeed, the inevitability that he does so
as he merges his unique personality into larger institutional
structures. It is not anger, violence, aggression, destructiveness,
which is so dangerous, but the greatly valued idea of OBEDIENCE.</p><p><br></p><p>It is ironic that the virtues of loyalty, discipline and
self-sacrifice that we value so highly in the individual are the very
properties that create destructive organizational energies of war and
that blind men to malevolent systems of authority.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember, if we want to create a new humanity, we will have to
reconsider the whole mind of man. The past has created a a very ugly
mind – of course, with beautiful labels, with beautiful painted smiles,
and behind is great animality.</p><p><br></p><p>My emphasis is on the individual not on the society, not on the
nation, not on the religion. My emphasis is on the individual. The
individual has to be freed from all kinds of social bondages and
slaveries. That’s what sannyas is all about. Become aware... and out of
your awareness, obedience is good, disobedience is good. But it HAS to
be rooted in your awareness – then everything is good. And out of
unawareness, obedience is bad, disobedience is bad.</p><p><br></p><p>Let me remind you: I am not telling you to be disobedient, because if
it is out of unawareness, and you say NO, it is as bad as saying yes. I
am not teaching you disobedience, disorder, indiscipline. I am not doing
that kind of thing at all. I can be misunderstood. I AM being
misunderstood. What I am saying is: I am making you responsible.</p><p><br></p><p>The individual is TOTALLY responsible whatsoever he is doing. So you
have to think, meditate, and act out of your meditations – and
whatsoever you do will be virtuous, and whatsoever you do will be moral,
and it will be a totally different kind of morality.</p><p><br></p><p>The last question Question 6</p><p>BELOVED OSHO, THIS MORNING WHEN YOU TOLD THE STORY ABOUT THE TWO
EIGHTY- YEAR-OLDS TALKING ON THE MORNING AFTER THEIR WEDDING NIGHT, I
LET OUT A WHOOP OF LAUGHTER AT THE PUNCHLINE. REALIZING THAT I WAS OUT
OF CONTROL, I CLASPED MY HAND OVER MY MOUTH AND CONTROLLED MYSELF: I
CAN’T HELP IT. I LOVE TO LISTEN TO YOU TELL STORIES. I LOOK FORWARD TO
THE NEXT ONE DURING DISCOURSE. AM I BEING FRIVOLOUS? SHOULD I BE MORE
SERIOUS?</p><p>Anand Bario,</p><p><br></p><p>SERIOUSNESS IS ILLNESS. Seriousness is pathological. Be sincere, but
never be serious. And sincerity is totally different. Seriousness is an
assumed, pretended phenomenon; sincerity is of the heart. Sincerity is a
kind of intensity in everything that you do.</p><p><br></p><p>And it was good that you had a whoop of laughter! Now, hiding it
behind your hands is phony, is pseudo. Let it be there! Laughter is good
– good in every way: physically, psychologically, spiritually.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is not being frivolous. We have been taught wrong things –
that’s why people move with long faces in the world. We have been taught
UTTERLY wrong things. Christians say Jesus never laughed. Why? And I
know that he laughed, I know him perfectly well. But Christians were
afraid: Jesus laughing will look frivolous. How can a saint laugh? The
saint has to be with a long face. The saints come only with long faces.
And, in fact, the man who has a long face can never be a saint.</p><p><br></p><p>Laughter is something of a very superior quality. No other animal
except man can laugh. If suddenly on the road you see a buffalo
laughing... you will go mad. You will never be the same again! No other
animal can laugh, except man. It is human dignity that man can laugh –
it is human dignity, glory.</p><p><br></p><p>Laughter is something spiritual. It belongs only to higher its of
intelligence. The more intelligent you are. the more capable you are of
laughing at things. Not only at things, but at yourself too. You become
capable of seeing the whole grand absurdity of life, this great
ridiculousness of life.</p><p><br></p><p>Christians made Jesus look very sad. That’s why paintings of Jesus or
sculptures of his face all look a little ugly. They don’t have that joy
that is expressed by Krishna – his flute, his dance. They don’t have
that laughter that you will see in Bodhidharma’s pictures, Lao Tzu’s
pictures. They don’t have that superb quality that you will find in a
genius like Chuang Tzu – the genius of the absurd.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus must have laughed, because he was a very earthy man. He loved
good food, he loved good company, he loved people. He ate well, and he
was also a drunkard. Now, a drunkard and not laughing? – that is
impossible. And he must have been telling jokes. Believe me! A drunkard
and not telling jokes? The gospel writers must have dropped them. Even
my editors sometimes feel that this is too much, unprintable! But I
don’t allow them to drop anything.</p><p><br></p><p>The gospels were written after Jesus died, three hundred years
afterwards, so the editors had absolute freedom to do whatsoever they
wanted. I know beautiful jokes have been dropped. Jesus was a Jew – and
Jews have the best jokes in the world.</p><p><br></p><p>Bario, don’t be worried about frivolousness. And sometimes even to be
frivolous is beautiful. Even to be frivolous sometimes has a grandeur
about it, a weightlessness, a beauty, a benediction. I accept life in
all its colours, the whole rainbow: from frivolousness to sincerity.</p><p><br></p><p>Just for you I will tell two jokes:</p><p><br></p><p>Finkelstein’s father was very unhappy because his son regularly did
the two things that a good Jew is not supposed to do: eat ham and go
with non-Jewish women. Finally he complained to the rabbi.</p><p>“Rabbi,” he cried, “I don’t know what to do. Whenever my son Ezra
sees some ham, he immediately sinks his teeth into it, and when he sees
a non-Jewish girl, he hugs and kisses her.”</p><p><br></p><p>So Ezra had to go and see the rabbi. “What is this your father tells
me?” demanded the rabbi in a loud voice. “You sink your teeth into ham
sandwiches and kiss Christian girls? What is the matter with you?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Rabbi, what can I do?” said Ezra apologetically, “I’m crazy!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Nonsense,” said the rabbi. “If you bit into the girl and kissed the
ham sandwich – THEN you would be crazy! But as things are, everything is
in order and you are perfectly normal. Just don’t do it any more!!”</p><p><br></p><p>And the second:</p><p><br></p><p>There was this owner-operator of a bar who was constantly besieged
with requests from his male customers for the names of prostitutes and
their whereabouts.</p><p><br></p><p>One day he decided it was stupid not to tap into this source of
income, so he went and got a couple of girls and installed them in a
couple of rooms over the bar. Whenever a customer wanted a girl, he
merely sent them upstairs.</p><p><br></p><p>A couple of days after this new business began, a customer returned
from upstairs very unhappy and complained to the man about the lousy
blow-job he had just had.</p><p><br></p><p>The owner ordered the man to follow him back upstairs, called for the
three girls who were working to gather in the bedroom, told the man to
get back on the bed, turned to the girls and said, “Okay girls, I am
going to show you HOW just ONE more time, so dammit, get it right!!”</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t be worried about frivolousness – that is part of life. And a
real life contains all; it has all the nuances, all the notes and all
the colours. So, Bario, you can have a good laugh. No need to hide it. I
would like my place to be a place of laughter, joy, festivity. I want to
be a festival to you.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part2>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

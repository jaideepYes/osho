‌CHAPTER 1
The Greatest Luxury

RENDER TO THE IMMORTAL GODS THE CONSECRATED CULT; GUARD THEN THY FAITH:
... REVERE THE MEMORY OF THE ILLUSTRIOUS HEROES, OF SPIRITS, DEMI-GODS.… BE A GOOD SON, JUST BROTHER; SPOUSE TENDER; AND GOOD FATHER.
CHOOSE FOR THY FRIEND, THE FRIEND OF VIRTUE; YIELD TO HIS GENTLE COUNSELS, PROFIT BY HIS LIFE; AND FOR A TRIFLING GRIEVANCE NEVER LEAVE HIM;</description>

Bliss Beyond All Duality
30 December 1978 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1
OSHO, I HAVE FALLEN IN LOVE WITH YOU. WHY?

‌CHAPTER 2
Love Comes Faceless
22 December 1978 am in Buddha Hall The first question, Dharma Chetana, Question 1
OSHO,
MEMORY CAN’T RECALL YOUR FACE, SO LOVE COMES, FACELESS. UNFAMILIAR IS THE PART OF ME THAT LOVES YOU.
SHE HAS NO NAME,
AND SHE COMES AND GOES AND WHEN GONE,
I WIPE MY TEAR-STAINED FACE SO THAT IT REMAINS A SECRET.
Dharma Chetana,</description>

‌CHAPTER 3
Falling Upwards
23 December 1978 am in Buddha Hall
The first question Question 1
OSHO, THANK YOU FOR THE DELICATE SYNTHESIS. GREAT JOY ARISES IN UNDERSTANDING THE PURPOSELESSNESS OF EXISTENCE.
Deva Nirguna,
TRUTH ALWAYS TRIGGERS A PROCESS IN YOU, even if the truth is not your own. The very hearing of it creates a parallel process in you. It is not caused by hearing it; it follows not the law of cause and effect but the law of synchronicity.</description>

I Mean Business!

OSHO – BUDDHA, MAHAVIRA, MOHAMMED AND CHRIST WERE ENLIGHTENED MAN. THEY TRIED TO TEACH THEIR DISCIPLES THE METHODS TO BECOME ENLIGHTENED.

The first question Question 1
OSHO, WHAT IS THE TOTALITY OF MYSELF? WHY DO I GO ON AVOIDING IT?

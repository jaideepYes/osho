The first question:
Question 1
WHAT&#39;S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A MADMAN AND A DEVOTEE?
Not much. And yet much. Both are mad but their madness has a totally different quality to it; the center of madness is different. The madman is mad from the head; the devotee is mad from the heart.</description>

The first question:
Question 1
CAN YOU TALK ABOUT FACING THE DEATH OF EACH MOMENT AND LETTING GO?
Death is already happening. Whether you face it or not, whether you look at it or not, it is already there.
It is just like breathing.</description>

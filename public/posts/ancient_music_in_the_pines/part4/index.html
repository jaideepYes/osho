Whether you face it or not, whether you look at it or not, it is already there.\nIt is just like breathing. When a child is born, he inhales. he breathes in for the first time.\nThat is the beginning of life. And when one day he becomes old, dies, he will exhale.\nDeath always happens with exhalation and birth with inhalation. But exhalation and inhalation are happening continuously. With each inhalation you are born; with each exhalation you die.\nSo the first thing to understand is that death is not somewhere in the future, waiting for you, as it has been always pictured. It is part of life; it is an ongoing process -- not in the future, here, now.\nLife and death are two aspects of existence. simultaneously happening together.\nOrdinarily, you have been taught to think of death as being against life. Death is not against life -- life is not possible without death. Death is the very ground on which life exists. Death and life are like two wings: the bird cannot fly with one wing, and the being cannot be without death. So the first thing is a clear understanding of what we mean by death.\nDeath is an absolutely necessary process for life to be. It is not the enemy, it is the friend.\nAnd it is not there somewhere in the future, it is here, now. It is not going to happen, it has been always happening. Since you have been here it has been with you. With each exhalation it happens -- a little death, a small death -- but because of fear we have put it in the future.\nThe mind always tries to avoid things which it cannot comprehend, and death is one of the most incomprehensible mysteries. There are only three mysteries: life, death and love.\nAll these three are beyond mind.\nSo mind takes life for granted; then there is no need to inquire. That is a way of avoiding.\nYou never think, you never meditate on life; you have simply accepted it, taken it for granted. It is a tremendous mystery. You are alive, but don't think that you have known life.\nFor death, mind plays another trick: it postpones it. To accept it here and now would be a constant worry, so the mind puts it somewhere in the future -- then there is no hurry.\nWhen it comes, we will see.\nAnd for love, mind has created substitutes which are not love. Sometimes you call your possessiveness your love; sometimes you call your attachment your love; sometimes you call your domination your love -- these are ego games. Love has nothing to do with them.\nIn fact, because of these games, love is not possible.\nBetween life and death, between the two banks of life and death, flows the river of love.\nAnd that is possible only for a person who does not take life for granted, who moves deep into the quality of being alive and becomes existential, authentic. Love is for the person who accepts death here and now and does not postpone it. Then between these two a beautiful phenomenon arises: the river of love.\nLife and death are like two banks. The possibility is there for the river of love to flow, but it is only a possibility. You will have to materialize it. Life and death are there, but love has to be materialized -- that is the goal of being a human. Unless love materializes, you have missed -- you have missed the whole point of being.\nDeath is already happening -- so don't put it in the future. If you don't put it in the future there is no question of defending yourself. If it is already happening -- and it has been already happening always -- then there is no question of protecting yourself against death.\nDeath has not killed you, it has been happening while you were still alive. It is happening just now and life is not destroyed by it; in fact, because of it, life renews itself each moment. When the old leaves fall, they make space for the new leaves to come. When the old flowers disappear, the new flowers appear. When one door closes, another immediately opens. Each moment you die and each moment there is resurrection.\nOnce a Christian missionary came to me and he asked, 'Do you believe in Jesus\nChrist's resurrection?'\nI told him that there was no need to go so far. Each moment everybody is resurrected. But he could not understand. It is difficult for people who are too much into their ideology.\nHe said, 'But do you believe that he was crucified? Is this not just a myth, or is it a reality? What do you think?'\nI said to him again that everybody is crucified every moment. That is the whole meaning of Jesus' crucifixion and his resurrection. Whether it is historical or not does not matter a bit. It is simply irrelevant to think whether it happened or not -- it is HAPPENING.\nEach moment the past is crucified, the old leaves disappear. And each moment a new being arises in you, resurrects. It is a constant miracle.\nThe second thing to understand about death is that death is the only certainty. Everything else is uncertain: it may happen, it may not happen. Death is certain because in birth half of it has already happened, so the other end must be somewhere, the other pole must be somewhere in the dark. You have not come across it because you are afraid; you don't move in the dark. But it is certain! With birth, death has become a certainty.\nOnce this certainty penetrates your understanding, you are relaxed. Whenever something is absolutely certain then there is no worry. Worry arises out of uncertainty.\nWatch. A man is dying and he is very worried. The moment death becomes certain and the doctors say, 'Now you cannot be saved,' he is shocked. A shivering goes through his being. But then things settle, and immediately all worries disappear. If the person is allowed to know that he is going to die and that death is certain, with that certainty a peace a silence, comes to his being.\nEvery person who is dying has the right to know it. Doctors go on hiding it many times, thinking, 'Why disturb?' But uncertainty disturbs; certainty, never. This hanging in-between, this being in limbo, wondering whether one is going to live or die -- this is the root cause of all worry. Once it is certain that you are going to die then there is nothing to do. Then one simply accepts it. And in that acceptance, a calmness, a tranquillity happens. So if the person is allowed to\nknow that he is going to die in the moment of death he becomes peaceful.\nIn the East we have been practicing that for millennia. Not only that, in countries like Tibet particular techniques were evolved to help a man to die. They called it BARDO\nTODO. When a person was dying, friends, relatives and acquaintances would gather together around him to give him the absolute certainty that he was going to die, and to help him to relax.\nBecause if you can die in total relaxation, the quality of death changes and your new birth somewhere will be of a higher quality. The quality of birth is decided by death. And then, in turn, the quality of birth will decide the quality of another death. That's how one goes higher and higher, that's how one evolves. And whenever a person becomes absolutely certain about death a flame arises on his face -- you can see it. In fact, a miracle happens: he becomes alive as he has never been before.\nThere is a saying in India that before a flame dies, it becomes tremendously intense. Just for a moment it flares up to totality. I was reading a small anecdote.\nOnce there were two little worms. The first was lazy and improvident, and always stayed in bed late. The other was always up early, going about his business. The early bird caught the early worm. Then along came a fisherman with a flashlight, and caught the night crawler. Moral: You can't win.\nDeath is certain. Whatsoever you do -- get up early or not -- death is certain. It has already happened, that's why it is certain; it is already happening, that's why it is certain.\nSo why wait for the moment when you are dying on your bed? Why not make it certain right now?\nJust watch. If I say death is certain, can't you feel fear disappearing within you? Can't you feel that with the very idea -- and it is just an idea right now, not your experience -- with just an idea that death is certain, you are calm and quiet. If you can experience it.… And you can, because it is a fact. I am not talking about theories; I don't deal in theories. This is a simple fact. Just open your eyes and watch it. And don't try to avoid it; there is no way to avoid it. In avoiding, you miss. Accept it. Embrace it. And live with the consciousness that each moment\nyou die and each moment you are born. Allow it to happen. Don't cling to the past -- it is no more, it is already gone. Why go on carrying dead things? Why be so burdened with corpses? Drop them. And you will feel weightlessness; you will feel unburdened.\nAnd once you drop the past the future drops on its own accord, because the future is nothing but a projection of the past. In the past you had some pleasures; now the mind projects those same pleasures into the future. In the past you had some sufferings; now the mind projects a future in which those sufferings are not allowed to happen. That's what your future is. What else is your future? Pleasures that you enjoyed in the past are projected and miseries are dropped. Your future is a more colorful and modified past, repainted, renovated, but it is the past. Once the past drops, suddenly the future drops --\nand then you are left here and now; then you are in existence, you are existential, and that is the only way to be. All other ways are just to avoid life. The more you avoid life, the more you become afraid of death.\nA person who is really living is not in any way afraid of death. If you are living rightly you are finished with death, you are already too grateful, fulfilled. But if you have not lived, then the constant worry continues, 'I have not lived yet and death is coming. And death will stop all; with death there will be no future.' So one becomes apprehensive, afraid, and tries to avoid death.\nIn trying to avoid death, one goes on missing life. Forget about that avoidance. Live life.\nIn living life, death is avoided. In living life, you become so fulfilled that if this very moment death comes and the future stops, you will be ready. You will be happily ready.\nYou have lived your life; you have delighted in existence; you have celebrated it; you are contented. There is no complaint, no grumbling; you don't have any grudge. You welcome death. And unless you can welcome death, one thing is certain -- you have not lived.\nI have heard one anecdote.\nTwo Hungarian noblemen fell into a deadly quarrel. But since neither was anxious to risk his life with either sword or pistol, a bloodless duel was decided\nupon. Each was to speak a number, and the one presenting the higher number would be adjudged the winner.\nThe seconds were of course at hand, and the excitement and suspense were extreme as the two noblemen, seated at opposite ends of a long table, bent to the task of thinking of a high number. The challenged party who had the privilege of going first. thought long and hard. The veins on his temples swelled, and the perspiration stood out on his forehead.\n'Three,' he said finally.\nThe other duelist said at once, 'Well, that beats me.'\nWhen you are afraid of death even the number three is the ultimate. When you are afraid of death you go on finding excuses for how to go on living. Whether your life means anything or not one simply goes on finding excuses to prolong it.\nIn the West now, there is a craze about how to prolong life. That simply shows that somewhere life is being missed. Whenever a country or a culture -- starts thinking about how to prolong life, it simply shows one thing -- that life is not being lived. If you live life, then even a single moment is enough. A single moment can be equal to eternity. It is not a question of length, it is a question of depth; it is not a question of quantity, it is a question of quality.\nJust think: would you like one moment of Buddha's life or would you like a thousand years of your own life? Then you will be able to understand what I mean about the quality, the intensity, the depth. In a single moment fulfillment is possible: you can bloom and blossom. But you may not bloom for one thousand years, you may remain hiding in the seed.\nThis is the difference between the scientific attitude towards life and the religious attitude. The scientific attitude is concerned with prolongation -- how to prolong life. It is not concerned with significance. So you can find old people in hospitals, particularly in the West, just hanging on. They want to die but the culture won't allow them. They are fed up with just being alive; they are simply vegetating. There is no significance, no meaning, no poetry, because everything has disappeared, and they are a burden to themselves. They are asking for euthanasia but society does not allow it. Society is so afraid of death that it does not allow death even for people who are ready to die.\nThe very word 'death' is a taboo word, more taboo than sex. Sex has by and by become almost accepted. Now death also needs a Freud to make it by and by accepted. Now death also needs a Freud to make it accepted so that it is no longer a taboo and people can talk about it and share their experiences about it. Then there is no need to hide it and there is no need to force people to live against themselves. In hospitals, in old people's homes, people are simply hanging on because the society, the culture, the law, won't allow them to be.\nIf they ask that they should be allowed to die, it looks as if they are asking for suicide.\nThey are not asking for suicide. In fact, they have become dead corpses; they are a living suicide and they are asking to be rid of it. The length is not the meaning. How long you live is not the point -- how deep you live, how intensely you live, how totally you live --\nthe quality -- is.\nScience is concerned about quantity; religion is concerned about quality. Religion is concerned with the art of how to live life and how to die life. Seven years, seventy years or seven hundred years -- what difference will it make? You will go on repeating the same vicious circle again and again and again. You will simply get more and more bored.\nSo change the focus of your being. Learn how to live each moment and learn how to die each moment. Both are together. If you know how to die each moment, you will be able to live each moment -- fresh, young, virgin. Die to the past. Don't allow it to interfere with your present. The moment you have passed it, let it be no longer there. It is no longer there; it only goes on in your memory, it is just a remembrance. Let this remembrance also be released. This psychological hang-up should not be allowed.\nI am not saying that you should forget everything that you know. I am not saying that all memory is bad. It has technical uses. You have to know how to drive, you have to know where your home is, you have to recognize your wife and your children. But those are not psychological hang-ups. When you come home of course you recognize that this is your wife. This is factual memory -- useful, enhances life, facilitates it. But if you come home and you look at your wife with all the past experiences with her, then that is a psychological hang-up. Yesterday\nshe was angry... now again you look with that memory in-between; your eyes are clouded by that memory. The day before yesterday she was sad or nasty and nagging -- now if you look through all these psychological impressions then you are not looking at the woman who is right now standing in front of you. You are looking at someone who is not there you are seeing someone who doesn't exist, you are looking at a ghost -- she is not your wife. And she may also be looking at you in the same way.\nSo ghosts meet, and realities remain separate; ghosts are married, and realities are divorced. Then these two ghosts will make love, these two ghosts will fight, quarrel, and do a thousand and one things, and the realities will be far, far away. There will be no contact; realities will not have any connection. Then there can be no communication, there can be no dialogue. Only realities can love. Ghosts can only make impotent gestures\n-- movements, but with no life in them.\nDrop the past each moment. Remember to drop it. Just as you clean your house every morning, every moment clean your inner house of the past. All psychological memories have to be dropped. Just keep factual things and your mind will be very, very clean and clear.\nDon't move ahead of yourself into the future because that is not possible to do. The future remains unknown; that is its beauty, that is its grandeur, glory. If it becomes known it will be useless, because then the whole excitement and the whole surprise will be lost.\nDon't expect anything in the future. Don't corrupt it. Because if all your expectations are fulfilled then too you will be miserable... because it is your expectation and it is fulfilled.\nYou will not be happy about it. Happiness is possible only through surprise; happiness is possible only when something happens which you had never expected, when something takes you completely unawares. If your expectations are fulfilled a hundred per cent, you will be living as if you are in the past, not in the future. You come home and you expected your wife to say something and she does. And you expected your child to behave in a certain way and the child does. Just think -- you will be constantly in boredom. Nothing will happen. Everything will be just a repetition, as if you are seeing something which you\nhave seen before, hearing something which you have heard before.\nContinuously you will see that it is a repetition of something. and repetition can never be satisfying. The new, the novel, the original, is needed.\nSo if your expectations are fulfilled. you will remain completely unfulfilled.\nAnd if your expectations are not fulfilled. then you feel frustrated. Then you feel constantly as if you propose and God goes on disposing; you feel that God is the enemy; you feel as if everybody is against you and everybody is working against you. If your expectations are never fulfilled you will feel frustrated.\nJust meditate upon your expectations: if they are fulfilled you will feel bored, if they are not fulfilled you will feel cheated. You will feel as if a conspiracy is going on against you. as if the whole existence is conspiring against you. You will feel exploited, you will feel rejected, you will not be able to feel at home. And the whole problem arises because you expect.\nDon't go ahead into the future. Drop expectations.\nOnce you drop expectations you have learned how to live. Then everything that happens fulfills you, whatsoever it is. For one thing, you never feel frustrated because in the first place you never expected. So frustration is impossible. Frustration is a shadow of expectation. With the expectation dropped, frustration drops on its own accord.\nYou cannot frustrate me, because I never expect anything. Whatsoever you do, I will say,\n'Good.' I always say, 'Good,' except for only a few times when I say, 'Very good.'\nOnce expectations are not there you are free to move into the unknown and to accept the unknown -- whatsoever it brings. And to accept it with deep gratitude. Complaints disappear; grumbling disappears; whatsoever the situation, you always feel accepted, at home. Nobody is against you, existence is not a conspiracy against you -- it is your home.\nThe second thing: when everything happens unexpectedly, everything becomes new. It brings a freshness to your life; a fresh breeze is continuously blowing and it does not allow dust to gather on you. Your doors and your windows are open:\nin comes sunshine, in comes the breeze, in comes the fragrance of flowers -- everything unexpected. You never asked for it, and existence goes on showering it on you. One feels God Is.\nThe proposition 'God is', is not a proposition; it is a statement of someone who has lived unexpectedly, without any expectations, who has lived in wonder. God is not a logical hypothesis; it is an exclamation of joy. It is just like, 'Aha!' -- It doesn't mean anything more. It simply means, 'Aha!' so beautiful, so wonderful, so new, so novel, and beyond anything that you could have dreamed. Yes, life is more adventurous than any adventure that you can imagine. And life is pregnant, always pregnant, with the unknown.\nOnce you expect, everything is destroyed. Drop the past; that is the way to die each moment. Never plan for the future; that is the way to allow life to flow through you. And then you remain in an unfrozen state, flowing. This is what I call a sannyasin -- no past, no future, just at this moment alive, intensely alive, a flame burning from both the ends, a torch burning from both the ends. This is what let-go is.\nThe second question:\nQuestion 2\nA SHORT TIME AGO I HEARD YOU SAY THAT YOU SAW YOURSELF\nSTANDING IN THE MARKETPLACE WITH A BOTTLE OF ALCOHOL IN YOUR\nHAND. TODAY L WAS REFUSED DARSHAN BECAUSE ALCOHOL WAS ON MY\nBREATH.\nThis is from Vedanta.\nWhat I say and what you hear are not necessarily the same. My alcohol is my alcohol; your alcohol is your alcohol. When I am talking about alcohol, I am not talking about your alcohol. I am talking about the alcohol of Buddhas. Yes, they are drunk -- drunk with the Divine.\nBut I can understand. You go on hearing that which you want to hear. You don't hear me; you manipulate. You manage to hear whatsoever you want to hear. Your unconscious goes on interfering, it goes on confusing you. Yes, I said that I am in the marketplace and not only in the marketplace, but with a bottle in my hand. This. is an old Zen saying.\nZen says that one who has finally understood himself comes back to the world -- and comes completely drunk. But why a bottle in the hand? The meaning is clear. Not only is he drunk, he has something to offer to you also. That is the meaning of the bottle in the hand. If you are ready, he can also make you drunk -\n- he has something to offer you. It is not only that he is drunk, he can share his drunkenness with you. Hence the bottle. He has an invitation, an invitation for you. That's why he has come to the marketplace.\nYou go to the marketplace to get something, he has come to the marketplace to give something. He has found something, and this finding is such that it has to be shared.\nSharing is its intrinsic nature. You cannot keep your bliss to yourself -- it would be like a flower trying to keep its fragrance to itself or a star trying to keep its light to itself. It is not possible. When there is light it spreads, it goes to others; it helps even those who are not even prepared to take its help. The fragrance disperses into the winds for friends and for foes alike.\nOnce a man has attained, he has to share. Not that he has to do something to share; he simply finds himself sharing because he cannot do otherwise. He moves to the marketplace where people are -- where people are stumbling in darkness, he brings his light to them; where people are thirsty, he brings his own drunkenness to be shared with them.\nYes, I am drunk and I have a bottle in my hand -- can't you see it! But it is not your bottle. But people have an unconscious tendency to hear something which is not said.\nI have heard one anecdote.\nA cavewoman came running to her husband in the greatest possible agitation.\n'Wok!' she called out. 'Something terrible has just happened. A saber-toothed tiger has just gone into my mother's cave and she is in there. Do something! Do\nsomething!'\nWok looked up from the macedon drumstick which he was gnawing and said, 'Why should I do I something? What the devil do I care what happens to a saber- toothed tiger?'\nIt is not necessarily that you don't hear that which is said, your unconscious continuously colors whatsoever you hear, It continuously interprets in its own ways. The words may be the same, but a slight jerk to the meaning, a slight turning, and everything changes.\nAfter ten years of marriage, a man was consulting a marriage counselor.\n'When I first married,' he said, 'I was very happy. When I would come at night, my little dog would race around barking, and my wife would bring me my slippers. Now, after all these years, when I come home, my dog brings me my slippers, and my wife barks at me.'\n'What is the complaint?' asked the counselor. 'You are still getting the same service!'\nYes, the service is the same, but still, not the same. You may hear my words and you may think the meaning is the same -- it is not. So please be careful. Handle my words very carefully; they are very delicate. And before you decide what they mean, don't be in a hurry. Meditate. Otherwise not only will you miss, you may misunderstand, and not only will my words not be able to help you, they can be harmful.\nThe third question:\nQuestion 3\nIS IT POSSIBLE FOR A POLITICIAN TO BE ENLIGHTENED?\nNever heard of it. It has never happened. There are intrinsic problems. The very dimension the politician moves in is against enlightenment.\nA few things have to be understood. Politics is a diametrically opposite phenomenon to religion. A scientist can easily become religious; his approach is different but not opposite. He may have been working with matter, with the\nobjective world, but his working is a sort of meditation. He needs a certain space in his consciousness, a silent space, to work and to discover. It is not very difficult to move from the objective towards subjectivity because the same space can be used for the inner journey.\nA poet can very easily become religious -- he is very close, very, very close; almost in the neighborhood. A painter or a sculptor can very easily become religious; they are already religious, unknowingly. They are already worshippers though they have not yet worshipped. They may not have thought about God. they may not have consciously been religious at all, they may not go to the church or to the temple they may not be concerned with the Bible and the Koran and the Gita -- but that is not the point. A painter goes on seeing something Divine in nature: colors are Divine for him. A poet goes on feeling something of the religious romance all around. All creative arts are very closely related --\nany moment consciousness can dawn, any ray can become a transformation.\nBut a politician moves in a diametrically opposite direction. His whole training is against religion.\nI have heard an anecdote:\nThe Congressman had delivered a stirring speech against a controversial bill. He was promptly buried in mountains of mail from back home as constituents wrote condemning his stand. Next day he was back on his feet in the house, this time making a speech in favor of the bill. When he finished, a colleague collared him.\n'Yesterday,' said the colleague, 'you made an eloquent explanation of the principles which motivated your stand. I wonder, what has happened to change your mind?'\n'Someday,' said the Congressman, 'you will learn that there comes a time in every man's life when he must rise above mere principles.'\nA politician is an opportunist; in fact, he has no principles. He talks about principles, but he has no principles. He pretends that he has principles but if he is a politician worth the name, he cannot have any principles. Those principles are just to fool people. He is on an ego trip. He uses all sorts of principles.\nI have heard about one politician. In an election campaign he was speaking in his\nconstituency. There was a great controversy about prohibition: about whether alcohol should be totally prohibited or not. When he was speaking, a man stood up and asked,\n'What is your stand on prohibition?'\nNow he became a little shaky because half the population was for it and half was against it. And he could see that half the crowd was for it and half the crowd was against it.\nWhatsoever he said was going to lose half the votes. It was really difficult. He was in a dilemma.\nAnd then he said, 'You are all my friends. Please raise their hands those who are in favor and those who are against.' Half the people raised their hands in favor, and half against.\nThen he said, 'Good. I am with my friends. I am all for my friends. You are all my friends and I am for you.'\nNow he is saying neither yes nor no.\nThe trip is of the ego: how to become more powerful, how to control others. Religion is just the opposite. It is not in any way an ego trip -- one has to lose the ego. And one is not trying to be powerful. In fact, one is trying to understand the total helplessness of the part against the whole; one is learning how to surrender, not how to conquer; and one is not concerned with others, one is totally concerned with himself. If this much is possible, that\n'I can become aware of my own being' it is enough, more than enough.\nThe politician is concerned with the outside world, he is an extrovert. The religious person is an introvert. He is not concerned with things, with the world with situations; he is concerned with the quality of his consciousness. A religious person is trying to find out how to be fulfilled; a politician is trying to show to the world that he is somebody. He may not be fulfilled but he pretends that he is fulfilled; he has opted for pretensions, hypocrisy. He simply wants the whole world to know that he is somebody special.\nextraordinary, very happy. Deep inside he may be carrying a hell but he believes\nthat if he can fool everybody else, he will be able to fool himself. That dream is never fulfilled.\nYou can fool everybody else by smiling a false smile, but how can you fool yourself?\nDeep down you know that everything is getting cold and dead; deep down you know that everything is empty, in vain. But one goes on thinking, 'If I can convince everybody else that I am somebody, then somehow I will be able to convince myself that I am somebody.\nThe politician is a liar. He's trying to lie -- to himself and to the whole world. The religious dimension is the dimension of being true, authentic.\nOnce it happened that a man entered a bar and said, 'Bartender, I want you to meet my dog. He talks. I will sell him to you for only ten dollars.'\n'Who do you think you are kidding?' said the bartender.\nThe dog, tears in his eyes looked up. 'Please buy me,' he said. 'This man treats me cruelly.\nHe never gives me a bone. He never bathes me. He is always kicking me around. And once I was the richest trick-dog in the country. I performed before presidents and kings.\nMy name was in the papers every day, and '\n'So he does talk,' said the bartender. 'But why sell a valuable dog like that for only ten dollars?'\n'Because,' said the customer, 'l hate liars.'\nA politician is a liar, and he is trying to convince himself through convincing others.\nA politician is almost mad -- mad for power. Many people are in the madhouses in the world: somebody thinks he is Adolph Hitler, somebody thinks he is Napoleon, somebody thinks he is Ford or Mao Tse Tung. They are in the jails, or in the madhouses, or in the hospitals, because we think they have gone mad.\nSomebody thinking that he is Adolph Hitler is thought to be mad, but what about Adolph Hitler himself? The only difference is this: -this man, this madman who thinks himself to be Adolph Hitler, has not been able to prove it, that's all. He's innocent. His madness is just innocence. Adolph Hitler proved to the world that, yes, he is. Adolph Hitler is more mad than this man. His madness was such that he proved to the whole world that he was somebody and if he could not create, then he could destroy.\nThere are only two possibilities. you can be a creator, then you feel a certain fulfillment --\nthat comes to a mother when she gives birth to a child, that comes to a poet when poetry is born, that comes to a sculptor when he has created something a beautiful piece in marble, in stone, in wood. Whenever you create something, you feel enhanced; you reach towards peaks. you get high.\nAll people who are creative are close to religion. Religion is the greatest creativity because it is an effort to give birth to yourself, to become a father and mother to yourself, to be born again, to be reborn through meditation, through awareness. Poetry is good, painting is good -- but when you give birth to your own consciousness, there is no comparison. Then you have given birth to the ultimate poetry, the ultimate music, the ultimate dance. This is the dimension of creativity. On the rung of creativity, religion is the last. It is the greatest art, the ultimate art -- that's why I call it 'the ultimate alchemy'.\nOn the opposite end of the ladder is destruction. People who cannot be creative become destructive because through destruction they can have a vicarious feeling that they are powerful. When Hitler destroyed millions of people, of course he had a very powerful feeling that, 'I am somebody. I can destroy the whole world.' He was almost ready to destroy the whole world -- he had almost destroyed it.\nA politician is a destructive mind. He may talk about the nation, the country; he may talk about utopias, socialism, communism, but basically a politician is a destructive mind.\nAnd a destructive mind cannot become enlightened.\nFirst, the whole energy should move towards Construction, towards creation. Then only is there the possibility that by and by you participate in the ultimate\ncreation -- that is nirvana, the ultimate creation, in which you are born Divine, infinite, unlimited. Then you expand, you spread all over existence; then you are no longer a wave, you have become the ocean.\nThe politician can never become enlightened. I am not saying that the politician cannot move towards enlightenment -- he can. But as he moves, he will have to drop politics. A politician is also a human being, but he will have to drop the politics, and by the time he comes to meditate he will be no more a politician. Remaining a politician, a politician cannot become enlightened. But his humanity is there. Even a Hitler can become a Buddha -- some day. One hopes he will. Some day, far away in the future, even an Adolph Hitler is going to become a Buddha; that is his potentiality. But then, by that time, he will not be an Adolph Hitler.\nNuclear war had come and gone. Only one tiny monkey in one isolated part of the world remained alive. After weeks of wandering about, he finally came across a little female monkey. He threw his arms around her in greeting.\n'I am starved,' he said. 'Have you found anything to eat?' 'Well,' she said. 'I found this little old apple.'\n'Oh, no, you don't!' he snapped. 'We are not going to start that all over again!'\nEven monkeys are worried about humanity. And I have heard monkeys talking. They don't believe in Darwin, they don't say that man has-evolved out of monkeys, they don't think that man is a developed form -- they think man has fallen from the monkeys. Of course -- fallen from the trees, fallen from the height, fallen from the monkeys.\nAnd this is true in a way, because man has up to now remained political. The whole history up to now has been political; no civilization has yet existed which has been religious -- not even Indian civilization. Not a single nation has become like a being which is religious -- only rare individuals, here and there, far apart. Somewhere a Buddha, a Jesus, a Zarathustra, a Lao Tzu -- islands. Otherwise, ordinarily, the main current of humanity has remained political.\nPolitics is basically ambition. Politics is basically wrong because ambition is wrong. You are not to become somebody, says religion, you are already. You are not to become powerful -- you are already. You are extensions of God. You need\nnot be worried about being powerful and being somebody on a throne; those are all stupid games, childish, very juvenile, immature. And you cannot find more immature people than politicians.\nIn fact, in a better world, politicians will be kept in madhouses, and mad people will be allowed to move into the world. Those mad people have not done anything wrong. They may be a little off the track but they have not been harmful. Politicians are dangerously mad people, tremendously dangerous.\nI have heard that before Richard Nixon renounced his throne, he called a meeting of his colleagues and he threatened that he had the power to go into the other room, push a button, and the whole world could be destroyed in twenty minutes.\nAnd, yes, he had that power. Millions of atom bombs are ready -- a button has just to be pushed. The power of the atom and H-bombs already made is seven times more than is needed to destroy this earth -- seven times morel We have become so skilled, super-skilled, in destruction that seven earths of this size could be destroyed. And nobody can say -- any day any president of America, or Soviet Russia, or China, can go mad.\nAnd politicians are almost mad...any day, anybody can push the button. It is now only a question of pushing a button. And everybody has mad moments, angry moments. The threat is very, very real.\nPolitics has been the disease of humanity, the cancer of consciousness.\nDrop all politics within you. And remember, when I am talking about politicians, I don't mean particularly those people who are in politics -- I mean all those who are ambitious.\nWherever ambition is, politics comes in; wherever you are trying to get ahead of somebody, politics comes in; wherever you are trying to dominate somebody -- maybe your wife, or your husband -- politics comes in. Politics is a very common disease, like the common cold.\nThe last question: Question 4\nSINCE I HAVE BEEN HERE, I HAVE LOST MY ABILITY TO CONCENTRATE. IT\nIS HARD FOR ME TO UTTER A LOGICAL SENTENCE. AND I HAVE BECOME\nVERY FORGETFUL. I FEEL MYSELF AS A STUPID CHILD. IS THAT THE WAY\nTO ME INTELLIGENCE YOU TALK ABOUT?\nThe ability to concentrate is not something to feel blessed about. It is a frozen state of mind, a very narrow state of mind. Useful, of course, useful -- for others. Useful in scientific inquiry, useful in business, useful in the market, useful in politics -- but absolutely useless for yourself. If you become too attuned with concentration you will become very, very tense. Concentration is a tense state of mind; you will never be relaxed. Concentration is like a torch, focused, and consciousness is like a lamp, unfocused.\nMy whole effort here is to teach you consciousness, not concentration. And this is the point to be remembered: if you become conscious, any moment you want to concentrate on a particular problem, you can. It is not a problem. But if you become too focused with concentration the vice versa is not true: you cannot relax. A relaxed mind can always concentrate. easily, there is no trouble about it. But a focused mind becomes obsessed.\nnarrow. It is not easy for it to relax and leave the tension. It remains tense.\nIf you meditate. first concentration will disappear and you will be feeling a little at a loss.\nBut if you go on, by and by you will attain to an unfocused state of light -- that's what meditation is. Once meditation is attained. concentration is child's play -- whenever you need to, you can concentrate. There will be no problem about it and it will be easy and without any tension.\nRight now, you are being used by society. Society wants efficient people. It is not worried about your soul, it is worried about your productivity. I am not worried about your productivity: man has already too much, more than he can enjoy -- there is no need to go on producing more. Now there is more need to\nplay around more and there is more need to be more conscious. Science has developed enough. Now, whatsoever science is doing is almost futile. Now, going to the moon is simply useless. But tremendous energy is wasted. Why? Because scientists are now obsessed -- they have to do something. They have learned a trick of concentration and they have to do something. They have to produce, they have to go on producing something -- they cannot relax. They will go to the moon, they will go to Mars, and they will persuade people that whatsoever they are doing is tremendously important. It is absolutely useless. But this happens.\nOnce you become trained in a certain thing, you go on in that line, blind, unless a cul de sac comes and you cannot go on anymore. But life is infinite. There comes no cul de sac.\nYou can go on and on and on.\nAnd now scientific activity has almost become ridiculous.\nReligious activity is totally different. It is not worried about being more efficient; the whole point is how to be more joyful, how to be more celebrating. So if you 90 with me, by and by, concentration will relax. And in the beginning you will feel afraid because you will see your skill disappearing, your efficiency disappearing. You will feel you are losing something that you have gained with so much effort. In the beginning it will happen. The ice is melting and becoming water. The ice was solid, something concentrated; now it is water -- loose, relaxed, flowing in all directions. But anytime you need ice, the water can be turned into ice again. There is no problem -- just a little more cooling is needed.\nThis is my own experience. Whatsoever I say, I say from my own experience -- the same has happened to me. First, concentration disappeared; but now I can concentrate on anything. There is no problem. But I don't remain in concentration; I can concentrate and relax -- whenever the need arises. Just as whenever the need arises, you walk; you don't sit on the chair and go on moving your Legs. There are a few people who go on moving because they cannot sit relaxed -- you will call this man restless!\nLegs in perfect order are needed so that whenever you need to, you can walk, you can run. But when there Is no need, you can relax, and the legs will no longer be functioning.\nBut your concentration has become almost as focused as if you are continuously preparing for an Olympic! Runners in an Olympic cannot relax. They have to run a particular amount every morning and evening; they are continuously on the go. If they relax for a few days they will lose their skill. But I call all Olympics political, ambitious, foolish. There is no need.\nCompetition is foolish. There is no need. If you enjoy running -- perfectly good. Run. and enjoy. But why compete? What is the point of competition? Competition brings illness, unhealthiness; competition brings jealousy, and a thousand and one diseases.\nMeditation will allow you to concentrate whenever the need arises, but if there is no need you will remain relaxed, flowing in all directions like water.\nIT IS HARD FOR ME TO UTTER A LOGICAL SENTENCE.\nFeel blissful, blessed. What is the point of uttering logical sentences! Utter nonsense; make sounds, gibberish, like birds... Like trees! (At this moment a nearby tree decided, with the help of a passing breeze, to illustrate Osho's words by shaking its branches and causing hundreds of leaves to fall with loud rustling sounds to the ground.) Look! This way! Is this logical? The tree is enjoying. Delighting. Simply shedding away the past.\nDelight. Sing. Utter sounds. Forget all logic! And by and by you will become more alive.\nLess logical of course that is the price one has to pay -- but you become dead if you become more logical and you become more alive if you become less logical.\nLife is the goal, not logic. What are you going to do with logic? If you are hungry, logic is not going to feed you; if you need love, logic is not going to hug you; if you are thirsty, logic will tell you that water is H20! It is not going to give you water, real water. No. It simply functions in formulas, maxims.\nLook at life, and by and by you will understand that life has its own very logical logic. Be attuned to it and that will become the door for your ecstasy, samadhi, nirvana.\nAND I HAVE BECOME VERY FORGETFUL.\nPerfectly good! If you can forget, you will be able to remember more. Forgetfulness is a great capacity -- it simply means getting the past dusted off. There is no need to remember everything that happens because almost ninety- nine per cent of it is trivia.\nWhat do you go on remembering?\nJust think... what do you go on remembering? Write it down and just look at it. It is trivia.\nWhat goes on in your mind? You will not be able to show it to your intimate friend because he will think you are mad. This goes on in your mind?\nIt is good. Forget. Forgetfulness is a great capacity because it will allow you to remember. It is part of remembrance. The useless has to be forgotten so that the useful is remembered -- and the useful is very, very small, the useless i5 too much. In twenty-four hours, millions of bits of information are collected by the mind. If you collect them and remember them all, you will be mad.\nI have heard about a man. He was once presented to the Governor-General in India because he was a man of rare memory. He knew only one language, Rajasthani-Hindi. He was a poor man, uneducated, but if you told him anything in any language, he would never forget it. But he would repeat it like a parrot, not knowing what it meant.\nTo the Governor-General's palace he was called, and the Governor-General was surprised to hear about his capacity. Thirty other persons were called, and in thirty languages they uttered a few sentences. It was arranged in the following manner: the man would go to the first person, and the first person would say the first word of his sentence. Then he would go to another person and he would say the first word of his sentence, in another language. Then he will go to the third. In this way he would go to thirty people. Then he would come back to the first who would now say his second word. This was repeated --\nmany rounds, many hours it took. And then he repeated all the sentences separately.\nThe Governor-General was simply puzzled. He could not believe it. But this man went mad.\nThis much memory is dangerous. This type of person is almost always idiotic.\nToo much memory is not a good sign; it simply says that you have a very mechanical mind. It is not a sign of intelligence. Hence you hear so many stories of absent-mindedness about great scientists, philosophers. They are people of great memory, and great intelligence has nothing to do with great memory. Memory is mechanical, intelligence is non-mechanical -- they are totally different.\nSo don't be worried. It is good. The memory is relaxing, many things will disappear, space will be created in you. And in that space you will be able to become more brilliant, more intelligent, more understanding. Intelligence means understanding; memory means a quality, a mechanical quality of repetition. Parrots have good memories. Don't be worried about your memory. In the beginning it happens: you have accumulated much rubbish and when you meditate that rubbish starts disappearing, falling away.\nAND I FEEL MYSELF A STUPID CHILD.\nThat is the way, the way to the kingdom of God. Lao Tzu says, 'Be like an idiot in this world so that you can understand the illogical ways of Tao.' Jesus says, 'Be like a child --\nbecause only those who are like children will be able to enter into the kingdom of God.'\nDon't be worried about those things; the non-essential is dropping away. Feel happy and grateful. Once the rubbish has dropped, the real will arise; non- essential gone, the essential will arise. This is the way to reach to one's own source.\nBut many times you will get scared because you are losing your grip on what you have valued up till now. But I can tell you only one thing: I have traveled the same path and have passed through the same phases. They are phases -- they come and go. And your consciousness will become more and more purified, virgin -- pure, uncorrupted. That uncorrupted consciousness is God.\nAncient Music in the Pines Chapter #9\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"8744","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/ancient_music_in_the_pines/part4/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/ancient_music_in_the_pines/>Ancient Music in the Pines</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: Three Mysteries</h1><div class=post-meta>42 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;8744 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Ancient_Music_in_the_Pines/part4.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part3>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

title: Three Mysteries<span id=bookmark7>‌</span></h2><p>28 February 1976 am in Buddha Hall Archive</p><p>code:</p><p>7602280</p><p>ShortTitle:</p><p>ANCIEN08</p><p>Audio:</p><p>Yes Video: No Length:</p><p>95</p><p>mins</p><p>The first question:</p><p>Question 1</p><p>CAN YOU TALK ABOUT FACING THE DEATH OF EACH MOMENT AND LETTING
GO?</p><p>Death is already happening. Whether you face it or not, whether you
look at it or not, it is already there.</p><p>It is just like breathing. When a child is born, he inhales. he
breathes in for the first time.</p><p>That is the beginning of life. And when one day he becomes old, dies,
he will exhale.</p><p>Death always happens with exhalation and birth with inhalation. But
exhalation and inhalation are happening continuously. With each
inhalation you are born; with each exhalation you die.</p><p>So the first thing to understand is that death is not somewhere in
the future, waiting for you, as it has been always pictured. It is part
of life; it is an ongoing process -- not in the future, here, now.</p><p>Life and death are two aspects of existence. simultaneously happening
together.</p><p>Ordinarily, you have been taught to think of death as being against
life. Death is not against life -- life is not possible without death.
Death is the very ground on which life exists. Death and life are like
two wings: the bird cannot fly with one wing, and the being cannot be
without death. So the first thing is a clear understanding of what we
mean by death.</p><p>Death is an absolutely necessary process for life to be. It is not
the enemy, it is the friend.</p><p>And it is not there somewhere in the future, it is here, now. It is
not going to happen, it has been always happening. Since you have been
here it has been with you. With each exhalation it happens -- a little
death, a small death -- but because of fear we have put it in the
future.</p><p>The mind always tries to avoid things which it cannot comprehend, and
death is one of the most incomprehensible mysteries. There are only
three mysteries: life, death and love.</p><p>All these three are beyond mind.</p><p>So mind takes life for granted; then there is no need to inquire.
That is a way of avoiding.</p><p>You never think, you never meditate on life; you have simply accepted
it, taken it for granted. It is a tremendous mystery. You are alive, but
don't think that you have known life.</p><p>For death, mind plays another trick: it postpones it. To accept it
here and now would be a constant worry, so the mind puts it somewhere in
the future -- then there is no hurry.</p><p>When it comes, we will see.</p><p>And for love, mind has created substitutes which are not love.
Sometimes you call your possessiveness your love; sometimes you call
your attachment your love; sometimes you call your domination your love
-- these are ego games. Love has nothing to do with them.</p><p>In fact, because of these games, love is not possible.</p><p>Between life and death, between the two banks of life and death,
flows the river of love.</p><p>And that is possible only for a person who does not take life for
granted, who moves deep into the quality of being alive and becomes
existential, authentic. Love is for the person who accepts death here
and now and does not postpone it. Then between these two a beautiful
phenomenon arises: the river of love.</p><p>Life and death are like two banks. The possibility is there for the
river of love to flow, but it is only a possibility. You will have to
materialize it. Life and death are there, but love has to be
materialized -- that is the goal of being a human. Unless love
materializes, you have missed -- you have missed the whole point of
being.</p><p>Death is already happening -- so don't put it in the future. If you
don't put it in the future there is no question of defending yourself.
If it is already happening -- and it has been already happening always
-- then there is no question of protecting yourself against death.</p><p>Death has not killed you, it has been happening while you were still
alive. It is happening just now and life is not destroyed by it; in
fact, because of it, life renews itself each moment. When the old leaves
fall, they make space for the new leaves to come. When the old flowers
disappear, the new flowers appear. When one door closes, another
immediately opens. Each moment you die and each moment there is
resurrection.</p><p>Once a Christian missionary came to me and he asked, 'Do you believe
in Jesus</p><p>Christ's resurrection?'</p><p>I told him that there was no need to go so far. Each moment everybody
is resurrected. But he could not understand. It is difficult for people
who are too much into their ideology.</p><p>He said, 'But do you believe that he was crucified? Is this not just
a myth, or is it a reality? What do you think?'</p><p>I said to him again that everybody is crucified every moment. That is
the whole meaning of Jesus' crucifixion and his resurrection. Whether it
is historical or not does not matter a bit. It is simply irrelevant to
think whether it happened or not -- it is HAPPENING.</p><p>Each moment the past is crucified, the old leaves disappear. And each
moment a new being arises in you, resurrects. It is a constant
miracle.</p><p>The second thing to understand about death is that death is the only
certainty. Everything else is uncertain: it may happen, it may not
happen. Death is certain because in birth half of it has already
happened, so the other end must be somewhere, the other pole must be
somewhere in the dark. You have not come across it because you are
afraid; you don't move in the dark. But it is certain! With birth, death
has become a certainty.</p><p>Once this certainty penetrates your understanding, you are relaxed.
Whenever something is absolutely certain then there is no worry. Worry
arises out of uncertainty.</p><p>Watch. A man is dying and he is very worried. The moment death
becomes certain and the doctors say, 'Now you cannot be saved,' he is
shocked. A shivering goes through his being. But then things settle, and
immediately all worries disappear. If the person is allowed to know that
he is going to die and that death is certain, with that certainty a
peace a silence, comes to his being.</p><p>Every person who is dying has the right to know it. Doctors go on
hiding it many times, thinking, 'Why disturb?' But uncertainty disturbs;
certainty, never. This hanging in-between, this being in limbo,
wondering whether one is going to live or die -- this is the root cause
of all worry. Once it is certain that you are going to die then there is
nothing to do. Then one simply accepts it. And in that acceptance, a
calmness, a tranquillity happens. So if the person is allowed to</p><p>know that he is going to die in the moment of death he becomes
peaceful.</p><p>In the East we have been practicing that for millennia. Not only
that, in countries like Tibet particular techniques were evolved to help
a man to die. They called it BARDO</p><p>TODO. When a person was dying, friends, relatives and acquaintances
would gather together around him to give him the absolute certainty that
he was going to die, and to help him to relax.</p><p>Because if you can die in total relaxation, the quality of death
changes and your new birth somewhere will be of a higher quality. The
quality of birth is decided by death. And then, in turn, the quality of
birth will decide the quality of another death. That's how one goes
higher and higher, that's how one evolves. And whenever a person becomes
absolutely certain about death a flame arises on his face -- you can see
it. In fact, a miracle happens: he becomes alive as he has never been
before.</p><p>There is a saying in India that before a flame dies, it becomes
tremendously intense. Just for a moment it flares up to totality. I was
reading a small anecdote.</p><p>Once there were two little worms. The first was lazy and improvident,
and always stayed in bed late. The other was always up early, going
about his business. The early bird caught the early worm. Then along
came a fisherman with a flashlight, and caught the night crawler. Moral:
You can't win.</p><p>Death is certain. Whatsoever you do -- get up early or not -- death
is certain. It has already happened, that's why it is certain; it is
already happening, that's why it is certain.</p><p>So why wait for the moment when you are dying on your bed? Why not
make it certain right now?</p><p>Just watch. If I say death is certain, can't you feel fear
disappearing within you? Can't you feel that with the very idea -- and
it is just an idea right now, not your experience -- with just an idea
that death is certain, you are calm and quiet. If you can experience
it.… And you can, because it is a fact. I am not talking about theories;
I don't deal in theories. This is a simple fact. Just open your eyes and
watch it. And don't try to avoid it; there is no way to avoid it. In
avoiding, you miss. Accept it. Embrace it. And live with the
consciousness that each moment</p><p>you die and each moment you are born. Allow it to happen. Don't cling
to the past -- it is no more, it is already gone. Why go on carrying
dead things? Why be so burdened with corpses? Drop them. And you will
feel weightlessness; you will feel unburdened.</p><p>And once you drop the past the future drops on its own accord,
because the future is nothing but a projection of the past. In the past
you had some pleasures; now the mind projects those same pleasures into
the future. In the past you had some sufferings; now the mind projects a
future in which those sufferings are not allowed to happen. That's what
your future is. What else is your future? Pleasures that you enjoyed in
the past are projected and miseries are dropped. Your future is a more
colorful and modified past, repainted, renovated, but it is the past.
Once the past drops, suddenly the future drops --</p><p>and then you are left here and now; then you are in existence, you
are existential, and that is the only way to be. All other ways are just
to avoid life. The more you avoid life, the more you become afraid of
death.</p><p>A person who is really living is not in any way afraid of death. If
you are living rightly you are finished with death, you are already too
grateful, fulfilled. But if you have not lived, then the constant worry
continues, 'I have not lived yet and death is coming. And death will
stop all; with death there will be no future.' So one becomes
apprehensive, afraid, and tries to avoid death.</p><p>In trying to avoid death, one goes on missing life. Forget about that
avoidance. Live life.</p><p>In living life, death is avoided. In living life, you become so
fulfilled that if this very moment death comes and the future stops, you
will be ready. You will be happily ready.</p><p>You have lived your life; you have delighted in existence; you have
celebrated it; you are contented. There is no complaint, no grumbling;
you don't have any grudge. You welcome death. And unless you can welcome
death, one thing is certain -- you have not lived.</p><p>I have heard one anecdote.</p><p>Two Hungarian noblemen fell into a deadly quarrel. But since neither
was anxious to risk his life with either sword or pistol, a bloodless
duel was decided</p><p>upon. Each was to speak a number, and the one presenting the higher
number would be adjudged the winner.</p><p>The seconds were of course at hand, and the excitement and suspense
were extreme as the two noblemen, seated at opposite ends of a long
table, bent to the task of thinking of a high number. The challenged
party who had the privilege of going first. thought long and hard. The
veins on his temples swelled, and the perspiration stood out on his
forehead.</p><p>'Three,' he said finally.</p><p>The other duelist said at once, 'Well, that beats me.'</p><p>When you are afraid of death even the number three is the ultimate.
When you are afraid of death you go on finding excuses for how to go on
living. Whether your life means anything or not one simply goes on
finding excuses to prolong it.</p><p>In the West now, there is a craze about how to prolong life. That
simply shows that somewhere life is being missed. Whenever a country or
a culture -- starts thinking about how to prolong life, it simply shows
one thing -- that life is not being lived. If you live life, then even a
single moment is enough. A single moment can be equal to eternity. It is
not a question of length, it is a question of depth; it is not a
question of quantity, it is a question of quality.</p><p>Just think: would you like one moment of Buddha's life or would you
like a thousand years of your own life? Then you will be able to
understand what I mean about the quality, the intensity, the depth. In a
single moment fulfillment is possible: you can bloom and blossom. But
you may not bloom for one thousand years, you may remain hiding in the
seed.</p><p>This is the difference between the scientific attitude towards life
and the religious attitude. The scientific attitude is concerned with
prolongation -- how to prolong life. It is not concerned with
significance. So you can find old people in hospitals, particularly in
the West, just hanging on. They want to die but the culture won't allow
them. They are fed up with just being alive; they are simply vegetating.
There is no significance, no meaning, no poetry, because everything has
disappeared, and they are a burden to themselves. They are asking for
euthanasia but society does not allow it. Society is so afraid of death
that it does not allow death even for people who are ready to die.</p><p>The very word 'death' is a taboo word, more taboo than sex. Sex has
by and by become almost accepted. Now death also needs a Freud to make
it by and by accepted. Now death also needs a Freud to make it accepted
so that it is no longer a taboo and people can talk about it and share
their experiences about it. Then there is no need to hide it and there
is no need to force people to live against themselves. In hospitals, in
old people's homes, people are simply hanging on because the society,
the culture, the law, won't allow them to be.</p><p>If they ask that they should be allowed to die, it looks as if they
are asking for suicide.</p><p>They are not asking for suicide. In fact, they have become dead
corpses; they are a living suicide and they are asking to be rid of it.
The length is not the meaning. How long you live is not the point -- how
deep you live, how intensely you live, how totally you live --</p><p>the quality -- is.</p><p>Science is concerned about quantity; religion is concerned about
quality. Religion is concerned with the art of how to live life and how
to die life. Seven years, seventy years or seven hundred years -- what
difference will it make? You will go on repeating the same vicious
circle again and again and again. You will simply get more and more
bored.</p><p>So change the focus of your being. Learn how to live each moment and
learn how to die each moment. Both are together. If you know how to die
each moment, you will be able to live each moment -- fresh, young,
virgin. Die to the past. Don't allow it to interfere with your present.
The moment you have passed it, let it be no longer there. It is no
longer there; it only goes on in your memory, it is just a remembrance.
Let this remembrance also be released. This psychological hang-up should
not be allowed.</p><p>I am not saying that you should forget everything that you know. I am
not saying that all memory is bad. It has technical uses. You have to
know how to drive, you have to know where your home is, you have to
recognize your wife and your children. But those are not psychological
hang-ups. When you come home of course you recognize that this is your
wife. This is factual memory -- useful, enhances life, facilitates it.
But if you come home and you look at your wife with all the past
experiences with her, then that is a psychological hang-up.
Yesterday</p><p>she was angry... now again you look with that memory in-between; your
eyes are clouded by that memory. The day before yesterday she was sad or
nasty and nagging -- now if you look through all these psychological
impressions then you are not looking at the woman who is right now
standing in front of you. You are looking at someone who is not there
you are seeing someone who doesn't exist, you are looking at a ghost --
she is not your wife. And she may also be looking at you in the same
way.</p><p>So ghosts meet, and realities remain separate; ghosts are married,
and realities are divorced. Then these two ghosts will make love, these
two ghosts will fight, quarrel, and do a thousand and one things, and
the realities will be far, far away. There will be no contact; realities
will not have any connection. Then there can be no communication, there
can be no dialogue. Only realities can love. Ghosts can only make
impotent gestures</p><p>-- movements, but with no life in them.</p><p>Drop the past each moment. Remember to drop it. Just as you clean
your house every morning, every moment clean your inner house of the
past. All psychological memories have to be dropped. Just keep factual
things and your mind will be very, very clean and clear.</p><p>Don't move ahead of yourself into the future because that is not
possible to do. The future remains unknown; that is its beauty, that is
its grandeur, glory. If it becomes known it will be useless, because
then the whole excitement and the whole surprise will be lost.</p><p>Don't expect anything in the future. Don't corrupt it. Because if all
your expectations are fulfilled then too you will be miserable...
because it is your expectation and it is fulfilled.</p><p>You will not be happy about it. Happiness is possible only through
surprise; happiness is possible only when something happens which you
had never expected, when something takes you completely unawares. If
your expectations are fulfilled a hundred per cent, you will be living
as if you are in the past, not in the future. You come home and you
expected your wife to say something and she does. And you expected your
child to behave in a certain way and the child does. Just think -- you
will be constantly in boredom. Nothing will happen. Everything will be
just a repetition, as if you are seeing something which you</p><p>have seen before, hearing something which you have heard before.</p><p>Continuously you will see that it is a repetition of something. and
repetition can never be satisfying. The new, the novel, the original, is
needed.</p><p>So if your expectations are fulfilled. you will remain completely
unfulfilled.</p><p>And if your expectations are not fulfilled. then you feel frustrated.
Then you feel constantly as if you propose and God goes on disposing;
you feel that God is the enemy; you feel as if everybody is against you
and everybody is working against you. If your expectations are never
fulfilled you will feel frustrated.</p><p>Just meditate upon your expectations: if they are fulfilled you will
feel bored, if they are not fulfilled you will feel cheated. You will
feel as if a conspiracy is going on against you. as if the whole
existence is conspiring against you. You will feel exploited, you will
feel rejected, you will not be able to feel at home. And the whole
problem arises because you expect.</p><p>Don't go ahead into the future. Drop expectations.</p><p>Once you drop expectations you have learned how to live. Then
everything that happens fulfills you, whatsoever it is. For one thing,
you never feel frustrated because in the first place you never expected.
So frustration is impossible. Frustration is a shadow of expectation.
With the expectation dropped, frustration drops on its own accord.</p><p>You cannot frustrate me, because I never expect anything. Whatsoever
you do, I will say,</p><p>'Good.' I always say, 'Good,' except for only a few times when I say,
'Very good.'</p><p>Once expectations are not there you are free to move into the unknown
and to accept the unknown -- whatsoever it brings. And to accept it with
deep gratitude. Complaints disappear; grumbling disappears; whatsoever
the situation, you always feel accepted, at home. Nobody is against you,
existence is not a conspiracy against you -- it is your home.</p><p>The second thing: when everything happens unexpectedly, everything
becomes new. It brings a freshness to your life; a fresh breeze is
continuously blowing and it does not allow dust to gather on you. Your
doors and your windows are open:</p><p>in comes sunshine, in comes the breeze, in comes the fragrance of
flowers -- everything unexpected. You never asked for it, and existence
goes on showering it on you. One feels God Is.</p><p>The proposition 'God is', is not a proposition; it is a statement of
someone who has lived unexpectedly, without any expectations, who has
lived in wonder. God is not a logical hypothesis; it is an exclamation
of joy. It is just like, 'Aha!' -- It doesn't mean anything more. It
simply means, 'Aha!' so beautiful, so wonderful, so new, so novel, and
beyond anything that you could have dreamed. Yes, life is more
adventurous than any adventure that you can imagine. And life is
pregnant, always pregnant, with the unknown.</p><p>Once you expect, everything is destroyed. Drop the past; that is the
way to die each moment. Never plan for the future; that is the way to
allow life to flow through you. And then you remain in an unfrozen
state, flowing. This is what I call a sannyasin -- no past, no future,
just at this moment alive, intensely alive, a flame burning from both
the ends, a torch burning from both the ends. This is what let-go
is.</p><p>The second question:</p><p>Question 2</p><p>A SHORT TIME AGO I HEARD YOU SAY THAT YOU SAW YOURSELF</p><p>STANDING IN THE MARKETPLACE WITH A BOTTLE OF ALCOHOL IN YOUR</p><p>HAND. TODAY L WAS REFUSED DARSHAN BECAUSE ALCOHOL WAS ON MY</p><p>BREATH.</p><p>This is from Vedanta.</p><p>What I say and what you hear are not necessarily the same. My alcohol
is my alcohol; your alcohol is your alcohol. When I am talking about
alcohol, I am not talking about your alcohol. I am talking about the
alcohol of Buddhas. Yes, they are drunk -- drunk with the Divine.</p><p>But I can understand. You go on hearing that which you want to hear.
You don't hear me; you manipulate. You manage to hear whatsoever you
want to hear. Your unconscious goes on interfering, it goes on confusing
you. Yes, I said that I am in the marketplace and not only in the
marketplace, but with a bottle in my hand. This. is an old Zen
saying.</p><p>Zen says that one who has finally understood himself comes back to
the world -- and comes completely drunk. But why a bottle in the hand?
The meaning is clear. Not only is he drunk, he has something to offer to
you also. That is the meaning of the bottle in the hand. If you are
ready, he can also make you drunk -</p><p>- he has something to offer you. It is not only that he is drunk, he
can share his drunkenness with you. Hence the bottle. He has an
invitation, an invitation for you. That's why he has come to the
marketplace.</p><p>You go to the marketplace to get something, he has come to the
marketplace to give something. He has found something, and this finding
is such that it has to be shared.</p><p>Sharing is its intrinsic nature. You cannot keep your bliss to
yourself -- it would be like a flower trying to keep its fragrance to
itself or a star trying to keep its light to itself. It is not possible.
When there is light it spreads, it goes to others; it helps even those
who are not even prepared to take its help. The fragrance disperses into
the winds for friends and for foes alike.</p><p>Once a man has attained, he has to share. Not that he has to do
something to share; he simply finds himself sharing because he cannot do
otherwise. He moves to the marketplace where people are -- where people
are stumbling in darkness, he brings his light to them; where people are
thirsty, he brings his own drunkenness to be shared with them.</p><p>Yes, I am drunk and I have a bottle in my hand -- can't you see it!
But it is not your bottle. But people have an unconscious tendency to
hear something which is not said.</p><p>I have heard one anecdote.</p><p>A cavewoman came running to her husband in the greatest possible
agitation.</p><p>'Wok!' she called out. 'Something terrible has just happened. A
saber-toothed tiger has just gone into my mother's cave and she is in
there. Do something! Do</p><p>something!'</p><p>Wok looked up from the macedon drumstick which he was gnawing and
said, 'Why should I do I something? What the devil do I care what
happens to a saber- toothed tiger?'</p><p>It is not necessarily that you don't hear that which is said, your
unconscious continuously colors whatsoever you hear, It continuously
interprets in its own ways. The words may be the same, but a slight jerk
to the meaning, a slight turning, and everything changes.</p><p>After ten years of marriage, a man was consulting a marriage
counselor.</p><p>'When I first married,' he said, 'I was very happy. When I would come
at night, my little dog would race around barking, and my wife would
bring me my slippers. Now, after all these years, when I come home, my
dog brings me my slippers, and my wife barks at me.'</p><p>'What is the complaint?' asked the counselor. 'You are still getting
the same service!'</p><p>Yes, the service is the same, but still, not the same. You may hear
my words and you may think the meaning is the same -- it is not. So
please be careful. Handle my words very carefully; they are very
delicate. And before you decide what they mean, don't be in a hurry.
Meditate. Otherwise not only will you miss, you may misunderstand, and
not only will my words not be able to help you, they can be harmful.</p><p>The third question:</p><p>Question 3</p><p>IS IT POSSIBLE FOR A POLITICIAN TO BE ENLIGHTENED?</p><p>Never heard of it. It has never happened. There are intrinsic
problems. The very dimension the politician moves in is against
enlightenment.</p><p>A few things have to be understood. Politics is a diametrically
opposite phenomenon to religion. A scientist can easily become
religious; his approach is different but not opposite. He may have been
working with matter, with the</p><p>objective world, but his working is a sort of meditation. He needs a
certain space in his consciousness, a silent space, to work and to
discover. It is not very difficult to move from the objective towards
subjectivity because the same space can be used for the inner
journey.</p><p>A poet can very easily become religious -- he is very close, very,
very close; almost in the neighborhood. A painter or a sculptor can very
easily become religious; they are already religious, unknowingly. They
are already worshippers though they have not yet worshipped. They may
not have thought about God. they may not have consciously been religious
at all, they may not go to the church or to the temple they may not be
concerned with the Bible and the Koran and the Gita -- but that is not
the point. A painter goes on seeing something Divine in nature: colors
are Divine for him. A poet goes on feeling something of the religious
romance all around. All creative arts are very closely related --</p><p>any moment consciousness can dawn, any ray can become a
transformation.</p><p>But a politician moves in a diametrically opposite direction. His
whole training is against religion.</p><p>I have heard an anecdote:</p><p>The Congressman had delivered a stirring speech against a
controversial bill. He was promptly buried in mountains of mail from
back home as constituents wrote condemning his stand. Next day he was
back on his feet in the house, this time making a speech in favor of the
bill. When he finished, a colleague collared him.</p><p>'Yesterday,' said the colleague, 'you made an eloquent explanation of
the principles which motivated your stand. I wonder, what has happened
to change your mind?'</p><p>'Someday,' said the Congressman, 'you will learn that there comes a
time in every man's life when he must rise above mere principles.'</p><p>A politician is an opportunist; in fact, he has no principles. He
talks about principles, but he has no principles. He pretends that he
has principles but if he is a politician worth the name, he cannot have
any principles. Those principles are just to fool people. He is on an
ego trip. He uses all sorts of principles.</p><p>I have heard about one politician. In an election campaign he was
speaking in his</p><p>constituency. There was a great controversy about prohibition: about
whether alcohol should be totally prohibited or not. When he was
speaking, a man stood up and asked,</p><p>'What is your stand on prohibition?'</p><p>Now he became a little shaky because half the population was for it
and half was against it. And he could see that half the crowd was for it
and half the crowd was against it.</p><p>Whatsoever he said was going to lose half the votes. It was really
difficult. He was in a dilemma.</p><p>And then he said, 'You are all my friends. Please raise their hands
those who are in favor and those who are against.' Half the people
raised their hands in favor, and half against.</p><p>Then he said, 'Good. I am with my friends. I am all for my friends.
You are all my friends and I am for you.'</p><p>Now he is saying neither yes nor no.</p><p>The trip is of the ego: how to become more powerful, how to control
others. Religion is just the opposite. It is not in any way an ego trip
-- one has to lose the ego. And one is not trying to be powerful. In
fact, one is trying to understand the total helplessness of the part
against the whole; one is learning how to surrender, not how to conquer;
and one is not concerned with others, one is totally concerned with
himself. If this much is possible, that</p><p>'I can become aware of my own being' it is enough, more than
enough.</p><p>The politician is concerned with the outside world, he is an
extrovert. The religious person is an introvert. He is not concerned
with things, with the world with situations; he is concerned with the
quality of his consciousness. A religious person is trying to find out
how to be fulfilled; a politician is trying to show to the world that he
is somebody. He may not be fulfilled but he pretends that he is
fulfilled; he has opted for pretensions, hypocrisy. He simply wants the
whole world to know that he is somebody special.</p><p>extraordinary, very happy. Deep inside he may be carrying a hell but
he believes</p><p>that if he can fool everybody else, he will be able to fool himself.
That dream is never fulfilled.</p><p>You can fool everybody else by smiling a false smile, but how can you
fool yourself?</p><p>Deep down you know that everything is getting cold and dead; deep
down you know that everything is empty, in vain. But one goes on
thinking, 'If I can convince everybody else that I am somebody, then
somehow I will be able to convince myself that I am somebody.</p><p>The politician is a liar. He's trying to lie -- to himself and to the
whole world. The religious dimension is the dimension of being true,
authentic.</p><p>Once it happened that a man entered a bar and said, 'Bartender, I
want you to meet my dog. He talks. I will sell him to you for only ten
dollars.'</p><p>'Who do you think you are kidding?' said the bartender.</p><p>The dog, tears in his eyes looked up. 'Please buy me,' he said. 'This
man treats me cruelly.</p><p>He never gives me a bone. He never bathes me. He is always kicking me
around. And once I was the richest trick-dog in the country. I performed
before presidents and kings.</p><p>My name was in the papers every day, and '</p><p>'So he does talk,' said the bartender. 'But why sell a valuable dog
like that for only ten dollars?'</p><p>'Because,' said the customer, 'l hate liars.'</p><p>A politician is a liar, and he is trying to convince himself through
convincing others.</p><p>A politician is almost mad -- mad for power. Many people are in the
madhouses in the world: somebody thinks he is Adolph Hitler, somebody
thinks he is Napoleon, somebody thinks he is Ford or Mao Tse Tung. They
are in the jails, or in the madhouses, or in the hospitals, because we
think they have gone mad.</p><p>Somebody thinking that he is Adolph Hitler is thought to be mad, but
what about Adolph Hitler himself? The only difference is this: -this
man, this madman who thinks himself to be Adolph Hitler, has not been
able to prove it, that's all. He's innocent. His madness is just
innocence. Adolph Hitler proved to the world that, yes, he is. Adolph
Hitler is more mad than this man. His madness was such that he proved to
the whole world that he was somebody and if he could not create, then he
could destroy.</p><p>There are only two possibilities. you can be a creator, then you feel
a certain fulfillment --</p><p>that comes to a mother when she gives birth to a child, that comes to
a poet when poetry is born, that comes to a sculptor when he has created
something a beautiful piece in marble, in stone, in wood. Whenever you
create something, you feel enhanced; you reach towards peaks. you get
high.</p><p>All people who are creative are close to religion. Religion is the
greatest creativity because it is an effort to give birth to yourself,
to become a father and mother to yourself, to be born again, to be
reborn through meditation, through awareness. Poetry is good, painting
is good -- but when you give birth to your own consciousness, there is
no comparison. Then you have given birth to the ultimate poetry, the
ultimate music, the ultimate dance. This is the dimension of creativity.
On the rung of creativity, religion is the last. It is the greatest art,
the ultimate art -- that's why I call it 'the ultimate alchemy'.</p><p>On the opposite end of the ladder is destruction. People who cannot
be creative become destructive because through destruction they can have
a vicarious feeling that they are powerful. When Hitler destroyed
millions of people, of course he had a very powerful feeling that, 'I am
somebody. I can destroy the whole world.' He was almost ready to destroy
the whole world -- he had almost destroyed it.</p><p>A politician is a destructive mind. He may talk about the nation, the
country; he may talk about utopias, socialism, communism, but basically
a politician is a destructive mind.</p><p>And a destructive mind cannot become enlightened.</p><p>First, the whole energy should move towards Construction, towards
creation. Then only is there the possibility that by and by you
participate in the ultimate</p><p>creation -- that is nirvana, the ultimate creation, in which you are
born Divine, infinite, unlimited. Then you expand, you spread all over
existence; then you are no longer a wave, you have become the ocean.</p><p>The politician can never become enlightened. I am not saying that the
politician cannot move towards enlightenment -- he can. But as he moves,
he will have to drop politics. A politician is also a human being, but
he will have to drop the politics, and by the time he comes to meditate
he will be no more a politician. Remaining a politician, a politician
cannot become enlightened. But his humanity is there. Even a Hitler can
become a Buddha -- some day. One hopes he will. Some day, far away in
the future, even an Adolph Hitler is going to become a Buddha; that is
his potentiality. But then, by that time, he will not be an Adolph
Hitler.</p><p>Nuclear war had come and gone. Only one tiny monkey in one isolated
part of the world remained alive. After weeks of wandering about, he
finally came across a little female monkey. He threw his arms around her
in greeting.</p><p>'I am starved,' he said. 'Have you found anything to eat?' 'Well,'
she said. 'I found this little old apple.'</p><p>'Oh, no, you don't!' he snapped. 'We are not going to start that all
over again!'</p><p>Even monkeys are worried about humanity. And I have heard monkeys
talking. They don't believe in Darwin, they don't say that man
has-evolved out of monkeys, they don't think that man is a developed
form -- they think man has fallen from the monkeys. Of course -- fallen
from the trees, fallen from the height, fallen from the monkeys.</p><p>And this is true in a way, because man has up to now remained
political. The whole history up to now has been political; no
civilization has yet existed which has been religious -- not even Indian
civilization. Not a single nation has become like a being which is
religious -- only rare individuals, here and there, far apart. Somewhere
a Buddha, a Jesus, a Zarathustra, a Lao Tzu -- islands. Otherwise,
ordinarily, the main current of humanity has remained political.</p><p>Politics is basically ambition. Politics is basically wrong because
ambition is wrong. You are not to become somebody, says religion, you
are already. You are not to become powerful -- you are already. You are
extensions of God. You need</p><p>not be worried about being powerful and being somebody on a throne;
those are all stupid games, childish, very juvenile, immature. And you
cannot find more immature people than politicians.</p><p>In fact, in a better world, politicians will be kept in madhouses,
and mad people will be allowed to move into the world. Those mad people
have not done anything wrong. They may be a little off the track but
they have not been harmful. Politicians are dangerously mad people,
tremendously dangerous.</p><p>I have heard that before Richard Nixon renounced his throne, he
called a meeting of his colleagues and he threatened that he had the
power to go into the other room, push a button, and the whole world
could be destroyed in twenty minutes.</p><p>And, yes, he had that power. Millions of atom bombs are ready -- a
button has just to be pushed. The power of the atom and H-bombs already
made is seven times more than is needed to destroy this earth -- seven
times morel We have become so skilled, super-skilled, in destruction
that seven earths of this size could be destroyed. And nobody can say --
any day any president of America, or Soviet Russia, or China, can go
mad.</p><p>And politicians are almost mad...any day, anybody can push the
button. It is now only a question of pushing a button. And everybody has
mad moments, angry moments. The threat is very, very real.</p><p>Politics has been the disease of humanity, the cancer of
consciousness.</p><p>Drop all politics within you. And remember, when I am talking about
politicians, I don't mean particularly those people who are in politics
-- I mean all those who are ambitious.</p><p>Wherever ambition is, politics comes in; wherever you are trying to
get ahead of somebody, politics comes in; wherever you are trying to
dominate somebody -- maybe your wife, or your husband -- politics comes
in. Politics is a very common disease, like the common cold.</p><p>The last question: Question 4</p><p>SINCE I HAVE BEEN HERE, I HAVE LOST MY ABILITY TO CONCENTRATE. IT</p><p>IS HARD FOR ME TO UTTER A LOGICAL SENTENCE. AND I HAVE BECOME</p><p>VERY FORGETFUL. I FEEL MYSELF AS A STUPID CHILD. IS THAT THE WAY</p><p>TO ME INTELLIGENCE YOU TALK ABOUT?</p><p>The ability to concentrate is not something to feel blessed about. It
is a frozen state of mind, a very narrow state of mind. Useful, of
course, useful -- for others. Useful in scientific inquiry, useful in
business, useful in the market, useful in politics -- but absolutely
useless for yourself. If you become too attuned with concentration you
will become very, very tense. Concentration is a tense state of mind;
you will never be relaxed. Concentration is like a torch, focused, and
consciousness is like a lamp, unfocused.</p><p>My whole effort here is to teach you consciousness, not
concentration. And this is the point to be remembered: if you become
conscious, any moment you want to concentrate on a particular problem,
you can. It is not a problem. But if you become too focused with
concentration the vice versa is not true: you cannot relax. A relaxed
mind can always concentrate. easily, there is no trouble about it. But a
focused mind becomes obsessed.</p><p>narrow. It is not easy for it to relax and leave the tension. It
remains tense.</p><p>If you meditate. first concentration will disappear and you will be
feeling a little at a loss.</p><p>But if you go on, by and by you will attain to an unfocused state of
light -- that's what meditation is. Once meditation is attained.
concentration is child's play -- whenever you need to, you can
concentrate. There will be no problem about it and it will be easy and
without any tension.</p><p>Right now, you are being used by society. Society wants efficient
people. It is not worried about your soul, it is worried about your
productivity. I am not worried about your productivity: man has already
too much, more than he can enjoy -- there is no need to go on producing
more. Now there is more need to</p><p>play around more and there is more need to be more conscious. Science
has developed enough. Now, whatsoever science is doing is almost futile.
Now, going to the moon is simply useless. But tremendous energy is
wasted. Why? Because scientists are now obsessed -- they have to do
something. They have learned a trick of concentration and they have to
do something. They have to produce, they have to go on producing
something -- they cannot relax. They will go to the moon, they will go
to Mars, and they will persuade people that whatsoever they are doing is
tremendously important. It is absolutely useless. But this happens.</p><p>Once you become trained in a certain thing, you go on in that line,
blind, unless a cul de sac comes and you cannot go on anymore. But life
is infinite. There comes no cul de sac.</p><p>You can go on and on and on.</p><p>And now scientific activity has almost become ridiculous.</p><p>Religious activity is totally different. It is not worried about
being more efficient; the whole point is how to be more joyful, how to
be more celebrating. So if you 90 with me, by and by, concentration will
relax. And in the beginning you will feel afraid because you will see
your skill disappearing, your efficiency disappearing. You will feel you
are losing something that you have gained with so much effort. In the
beginning it will happen. The ice is melting and becoming water. The ice
was solid, something concentrated; now it is water -- loose, relaxed,
flowing in all directions. But anytime you need ice, the water can be
turned into ice again. There is no problem -- just a little more cooling
is needed.</p><p>This is my own experience. Whatsoever I say, I say from my own
experience -- the same has happened to me. First, concentration
disappeared; but now I can concentrate on anything. There is no problem.
But I don't remain in concentration; I can concentrate and relax --
whenever the need arises. Just as whenever the need arises, you walk;
you don't sit on the chair and go on moving your Legs. There are a few
people who go on moving because they cannot sit relaxed -- you will call
this man restless!</p><p>Legs in perfect order are needed so that whenever you need to, you
can walk, you can run. But when there Is no need, you can relax, and the
legs will no longer be functioning.</p><p>But your concentration has become almost as focused as if you are
continuously preparing for an Olympic! Runners in an Olympic cannot
relax. They have to run a particular amount every morning and evening;
they are continuously on the go. If they relax for a few days they will
lose their skill. But I call all Olympics political, ambitious, foolish.
There is no need.</p><p>Competition is foolish. There is no need. If you enjoy running --
perfectly good. Run. and enjoy. But why compete? What is the point of
competition? Competition brings illness, unhealthiness; competition
brings jealousy, and a thousand and one diseases.</p><p>Meditation will allow you to concentrate whenever the need arises,
but if there is no need you will remain relaxed, flowing in all
directions like water.</p><p>IT IS HARD FOR ME TO UTTER A LOGICAL SENTENCE.</p><p>Feel blissful, blessed. What is the point of uttering logical
sentences! Utter nonsense; make sounds, gibberish, like birds... Like
trees! (At this moment a nearby tree decided, with the help of a passing
breeze, to illustrate Osho's words by shaking its branches and causing
hundreds of leaves to fall with loud rustling sounds to the ground.)
Look! This way! Is this logical? The tree is enjoying. Delighting.
Simply shedding away the past.</p><p>Delight. Sing. Utter sounds. Forget all logic! And by and by you will
become more alive.</p><p>Less logical of course that is the price one has to pay -- but you
become dead if you become more logical and you become more alive if you
become less logical.</p><p>Life is the goal, not logic. What are you going to do with logic? If
you are hungry, logic is not going to feed you; if you need love, logic
is not going to hug you; if you are thirsty, logic will tell you that
water is H20! It is not going to give you water, real water. No. It
simply functions in formulas, maxims.</p><p>Look at life, and by and by you will understand that life has its own
very logical logic. Be attuned to it and that will become the door for
your ecstasy, samadhi, nirvana.</p><p>AND I HAVE BECOME VERY FORGETFUL.</p><p>Perfectly good! If you can forget, you will be able to remember more.
Forgetfulness is a great capacity -- it simply means getting the past
dusted off. There is no need to remember everything that happens because
almost ninety- nine per cent of it is trivia.</p><p>What do you go on remembering?</p><p>Just think... what do you go on remembering? Write it down and just
look at it. It is trivia.</p><p>What goes on in your mind? You will not be able to show it to your
intimate friend because he will think you are mad. This goes on in your
mind?</p><p>It is good. Forget. Forgetfulness is a great capacity because it will
allow you to remember. It is part of remembrance. The useless has to be
forgotten so that the useful is remembered -- and the useful is very,
very small, the useless i5 too much. In twenty-four hours, millions of
bits of information are collected by the mind. If you collect them and
remember them all, you will be mad.</p><p>I have heard about a man. He was once presented to the
Governor-General in India because he was a man of rare memory. He knew
only one language, Rajasthani-Hindi. He was a poor man, uneducated, but
if you told him anything in any language, he would never forget it. But
he would repeat it like a parrot, not knowing what it meant.</p><p>To the Governor-General's palace he was called, and the
Governor-General was surprised to hear about his capacity. Thirty other
persons were called, and in thirty languages they uttered a few
sentences. It was arranged in the following manner: the man would go to
the first person, and the first person would say the first word of his
sentence. Then he would go to another person and he would say the first
word of his sentence, in another language. Then he will go to the third.
In this way he would go to thirty people. Then he would come back to the
first who would now say his second word. This was repeated --</p><p>many rounds, many hours it took. And then he repeated all the
sentences separately.</p><p>The Governor-General was simply puzzled. He could not believe it. But
this man went mad.</p><p>This much memory is dangerous. This type of person is almost always
idiotic.</p><p>Too much memory is not a good sign; it simply says that you have a
very mechanical mind. It is not a sign of intelligence. Hence you hear
so many stories of absent-mindedness about great scientists,
philosophers. They are people of great memory, and great intelligence
has nothing to do with great memory. Memory is mechanical, intelligence
is non-mechanical -- they are totally different.</p><p>So don't be worried. It is good. The memory is relaxing, many things
will disappear, space will be created in you. And in that space you will
be able to become more brilliant, more intelligent, more understanding.
Intelligence means understanding; memory means a quality, a mechanical
quality of repetition. Parrots have good memories. Don't be worried
about your memory. In the beginning it happens: you have accumulated
much rubbish and when you meditate that rubbish starts disappearing,
falling away.</p><p>AND I FEEL MYSELF A STUPID CHILD.</p><p>That is the way, the way to the kingdom of God. Lao Tzu says, 'Be
like an idiot in this world so that you can understand the illogical
ways of Tao.' Jesus says, 'Be like a child --</p><p>because only those who are like children will be able to enter into
the kingdom of God.'</p><p>Don't be worried about those things; the non-essential is dropping
away. Feel happy and grateful. Once the rubbish has dropped, the real
will arise; non- essential gone, the essential will arise. This is the
way to reach to one's own source.</p><p>But many times you will get scared because you are losing your grip
on what you have valued up till now. But I can tell you only one thing:
I have traveled the same path and have passed through the same phases.
They are phases -- they come and go. And your consciousness will become
more and more purified, virgin -- pure, uncorrupted. That uncorrupted
consciousness is God.</p><p>Ancient Music in the Pines Chapter #9</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part3>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

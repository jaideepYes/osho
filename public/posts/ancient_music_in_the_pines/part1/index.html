AS SOON AS THE BOY WAS INSIDE, THE FATHER\nLOCKED THE CHEST AND THEN MADE A LOT OF NOISE SO THAT THE WHOLE HOUSE WAS AROUSED. THEN HE SLIPPED QUIETLY AWAY. LOCKED INSIDE THE CHEST THE BOY WAS ANGRY, TERRIFIED, AND\nPUZZLED AS TO HOW HE WAS GOING TO GET OUT. THEN AN IDEA FLASHED TO HIM -- HE MADE A NOISE LIKE A CAT.\nTHE FAMILY TOLD A MAID TO TAKE A CANDLE AND EXAMINE THE CHEST.\nWHEN THE LID WAS UNLOCKED THE BOY JUMPED OUT, BLEW OUT THE\nCANDLE, PUSHED HIS WAY PAST THE ASTONISHED MAID, AND RAN OUT.\nTHE PEOPLE RAN AFTER HIM.\nNOTICING A WELL BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD THE BOY THREW IN A LARGE STONE, THEN HID IN THE DARKNESS. THE PURSUERS GATHERED\nAROUND THE WELL TRYING TO SEE THE BURGLAR DROWNING HIMSELF.\nWHEN THE BOY GOT HOME HE WAS VERY ANGRY AT HIS FATHER AND HE\nTRIED TO TELL HIM THE STORY; BUT THE FATHER SAID: 'DON'T BOTHER\nTO TELL ME THE DETAILS, YOU ARE HERE -- YOU HAVE LEARNED THE\nART.'\nBeing is one, the world is many...and between the two is the divided mind, the dual mind.\nIt is just like a big tree, an ancient oak: the trunk is one, then the tree divides into two main branches, the main bifurcation, from which a thousand and one bifurcations of branches grow. The being is just like the trunk of the tree -- one, non-dual -- and the mind is the first bifurcation where the tree divides into two, becomes dual, becomes dialectical: thesis and antithesis, man and woman, yin and yang, day and night, God and Devil, yoga and Zen. All the dualities of the world are basically in the duality of the mind -- and below the duality is oneness of being. If you slip below, underneath the duality you will find one -- call it God, call it nirvana, or whatsoever you like.\nIf you go higher through the duality, you come to the many million-fold world. This is one of the most basic insights to be understood -- that mind is not one.\nHence, whatsoever you see through the mind becomes two. It is just like a white ray entering a prism; it is immediately divided into seven colors and the rainbow is created.\nBefore it entered the prism it was one, through the prism it is divided. and the white color disappears into the seven colors of the rainbow.\nThe world is a rainbow, the mind is a prism, and the being is the white ray.\nModern research has come to a very significant fact, one of the most significant achieved in this century, and that is that you don't have one mind, you have two minds. Your brain is divided into two hemispheres: the right hemisphere and the left hemisphere. The right hemisphere is joined with the left hand, and the left hemisphere is joined with the right hand -- crosswise. The right hemisphere is intuitive, illogical, irrational, poetic, platonic, imaginative, romantic, mythical,\nreligious; and the left hemisphere is logical, rational, mathematical, Aristotelian, scientific, calculative. These two hemispheres are constantly in conflict -- the basic politics of the world is within you, the greatest politics of the world is within you. You may not be aware of it, but once you become aware, the real thing to be done is somewhere between these two minds.\nThe left hand is concerned with the right hemisphere -- intuition, imagination, myth, poetry, religion -- and the left hand is very much condemned. The society is of those who are right-handed -- right-handed means left hemisphere. Ten per cent of children are born left-handed but they are forced to be right-handed. Children who are born left-handed are basically irrational, intuitive, non- mathematical, non-Euclidean... they are dangerous for society so it forces them in every way to become right-handed. It is not just a question of hands, it is a question of inner politics: the left-handed child functions through the right hemisphere -- that society cannot allow, it is dangerous, so he has to be stopped before things go too far.\nIt is suspected that in the beginning the proportion must have been fifty-fifty -- left-handed children fifty per cent and right-handed children fifty per cent -- but the right-handed party has ruled so long that by and by the proportion has fallen to ten per cent and ninety per cent. Even amongst you here many will be left- handed but you may not be aware of it. You may write with the right hand and do your work with the right hand but in your childhood you may have been forced to be right-handed. This is a trick because once you become right-handed your left hemisphere starts functioning. The left hemisphere is reason; the right hemisphere is beyond reason, its functioning is not mathematical. It functions in flashes, it is intuitive, very graceful -- but irrational.\nThe left-handed minority is the most oppressed minority in the world, even more than Negroes, even more than the poor people. If you understand this division, you will understand many things. With the bourgeoisie and the proletariat the proletariat is always functioning through the right hemisphere of the brain: the poor people are more intuitive.\nGo to the primitive people, they are more intuitive. The poorer the person, the less intellectual -- and that may be the cause of his being poor. Because he is less intellectual he cannot compete in the world of reason. He is less articulate as far as language is concerned, reason is concerned, calculation is concerned -- he is almost a fool. That may be the cause of his being poor.\nThe rich person is functioning through the left hemisphere; he is more calculative, arithmetical in everything, cunning, clever, logical -- and he plans. That may be the reason why he is rich.\nThe bourgeoisie and the proletariat cannot disappear by communist revolutions, no, because the communist revolution is by the same people. The Czar ruled Russia; he ruled it through the left hemisphere of the mind. Then he was replaced by Lenin who was of the same type. Then Lenin was replaced by Stalin who was even more of the same type.\nThe revolution is false because deep down the same type of people are ruling -- the ruler and the ruled mean the same, and the ruled are those of the right-sided hemisphere. So whatsoever you do in the outside world makes no difference really, it is superficial.\nThe same applies to men and women. Women are right-hemisphere people, men are left-hemisphered. Men have ruled women for centuries. Now a few women are revolting but the amazing thing is that these are the same type of women. In fact they are just like men\n-- rational, argumentative, Aristotelian. It is possible that one day, just as the communist revolution has succeeded in Russia and China, somewhere, maybe in America, women can succeed and overthrow men. But by the time the women succeed, the women will no more be women, they will have become left- hemisphered. Because to fight, one has to be calculative, and to fight with men you have to be like men: aggressive. That very aggressiveness is shown all over the world in women's liberation. Women who have become part of that liberation movement are very aggressive, they are losing all grace, all that comes out of intuition. Because if you have to fight with men you have to learn the same trick; if you have to fight with men, you have to fight with the same techniques.\nFighting with anybody is very dangerous because you become like your enemy. That is one of the greatest problems of humanity. Once you fight with somebody, by and by you have to use the same technique and the same way. Then the enemy may be defeated but by the time he is defeated you have become your own enemy. Stalin is more Czar-like than any Czar, more violent than any Czar. Of course it has to be so: to throw Czars, very violent people are needed, more violent than the Czar himself. Only they will become the revolutionaries, will come out on top. By the time they reach there they have become Czars\nthemselves, and the society continues on the same way. Just superficial things change, deep down the same conflict remains.\nThe conflict is in man. Unless it is resolved there, it cannot be resolved anywhere else.\nThe politics is within you; it is between the two parts of the mind.\nA very small bridge exists. If that bridge is broken through some accident, through some physiological defect or something else, the person becomes split, the person becomes two persons -- and the phenomenon of schizophrenia or split personality happens. If the bridge is broken -- and the bridge is very fragile -- then you become two, you behave like two persons. In the morning you are very loving, very beautiful; in the evening you are very angry, absolutely different. You don't remember your morning... how can you remember? Another mind was functioning -- and the person becomes two persons. If this bridge is strengthened so much that the two minds disappear as two and become one, then integration, then crystallization, arises. What George Gurdjieff used to call the crystallization of being is nothing but these two minds becoming one, the meeting of the male and the female within, the meeting of yin and yang, the meeting of the left and right, the meeting of logic and illogic, the meeting of Plato and Aristotle.\nIf you can understand this basic bifurcation in your tree of then you can understand all the conflict that goes on around and inside you.\nLet me tell you an anecdote.\nAmong the Germans, Berlin is considered to be the very epitome of Prussian brusqueness and efficiency, while Vienna is the essence of Austrian charm and slipshoddery.\nThere is the tale of a Berliner visiting Vienna who was lost and in need of directions.\nWhat would such a Berliner do? He grabbed at the lapel of the first passing Viennese and barked out, 'The Post Office. Where is it?'\nThe startled Viennese carefully detached the other's fist, smoothed his lapel and said in a gentle manner,\n'Sir, would it not have been more delicate of you to have approached me politely and to have said. \"Sir, if you have a moment and happen to know, could you direct me to the Post Office?\"'\nThe Berliner stared in astonishment for a moment, then growled, 'I would rather be lost!'\nand stomped away.\nThat very same Viennese was visiting Berlin too that year and it turned out that now it was he who had to search for the Post Office. Approaching a Berliner he said politely,\n'Sir, if you have a moment and happen to know, could you please direct me to the Post Office?'\nWith machine-like rapidity the Berliner replied,\n'About face, two blocks forward, sharp turn right, one block forward, cross a street, half turn on the right, walk left over railroad tracks, pass news-stand into Post Office lobby.'\nThe Viennese, more bewildered than enlightened, nevertheless murmured, 'A thousand thanks, kind sir,' whereupon the Berliner snatched furiously at the other's lapel and shouted, 'Never mind the thanks, repeat the instructions!'\nThe male mind, the Berliner; the female mind, the Viennese. The female mind has a grace, the male mind has efficiency. and of course, in the long run, if there is a constant fight, the grace is bound to be defeated -- the efficient mind will win. because the world understands the language of mathematics not of love. But the moment your efficiency wins over your grace, you have lost something tremendously valuable: you have lost contact with your own being. You may become very efficient, but you will be no more a real person. You will become a machine, a robot-like thing.\nBecause of this here is constant conflict between man and woman. They cannot remain separate, they have to get into relationship again and again -- but they cannot remain together either. The fight is not outside, the fight is within you. And this is my understanding: unless you have resolved your inner fight between the right and the left hemispheres, you will never be able to be peacefully in love\n-- never -- because the inner fight will be reflected outside. If you are fighting inside and you are identified with the left hemisphere, the reason hemisphere, and you are continuously trying to overpower the right hemisphere, you will try to do the same with the woman you fall in love with. If the woman is continuously fighting her own reason inside, she will continuously fight the man she loves.\nAll relationships -- almost all, the exceptions are negligible, can be left out of account --\nare ugly. In the beginning they are beautiful; in the beginning you don't show the reality; in the beginning you pretend. Once the relationship settles and you relax, your inner conflict bubbles up and starts being mirrored in your relationship. Then come fights, then come a thousand and one ways of nagging each other, destroying each other. Hence the attraction for homosexuality. Whenever a society becomes too divided between man and woman, homosexuality erupts immediately. Because at least a man in love with a man is not that much in conflict. The love relationship may not be very satisfying, may not lead to tremendous bliss and orgasmic moments, but at least it is not so ugly as the relationship between a man and a woman. Women become lesbians whenever the conflict becomes too much, because at least the love relationship between two women is not so deep in conflict. The same meets the same; they can understand each other.\nYes, understanding is possible, but the attraction is lost, the polarity is lost -- it is at a very great cost. Understanding is possible, but the whole tension, the challenge, is lost. If you choose challenge, then comes conflict, because the real problem is somewhere within you. Unless you have settled, come to a deep harmony between your female and male mind, you will not be able to love.\nPeople come to me and they ask how to go deep in a relationship, I tell them, 'First you go deep in meditation. Unless you are resolved within yourself you will create more problems than you already have. If you move in relationship, all your problems will be multiplied. Just watch. The greatest and the most beautiful thing in the world is love but can you find anything more ugly, more hell- creating?'\nMulla Nasruddin once told me, 'Well, I have been putting off the evil day for months but I have got to go this time.'\n'Dentist or doctor?' I inquired.\n'Neither,' he said, 'I am getting married.'\nPeople go on avoiding marriage, people go on putting it off. When some day they find it impossible to get out of it only then they relax. Where is the problem? Why are people so afraid of getting deeply involved? Involvement immediately creates fear; commitment immediately creates fear -- and the modern man wants to have sex but no love.\nA woman told me that she wants sex only with strangers. Traveling in a train, meeting with a stranger -- that's okay -- but not even with someone who is friendly or familiar. I asked, 'Why?' She said that once you make love to someone who is known to you, some involvement starts. In a train, on a journey, you meet, make love, you don't know even what the other person's name is, who he is, from where he comes. You get down when your station comes and he moves away, forgotten forever; he leaves no scratch, you remain completely clean. You come out of it completely clean and unscratched.\nI can understand. This is the difficulty of the whole modern mind. All relationships are becoming by and by casual. People are afraid of any sort of commitment,, because they have come to know at least one thing out of bitter experience -- whenever you become related too much, the reality erupts, and your inner conflict starts being reflected by the other and then life becomes ugly, horrible, intolerable.\nIt happened once that I was sitting with a few friends in a university campus ground. One of the professors said, 'On the day my wedding occurred '\nBut the other professor stopped him immediately and said 'Pardon the correction, but affairs such as marriages, receptions, dinners, and things of that nature, take place. It is only calamities which occur. You see the distinction? Please don't say, \"The day my marriage occurred, or the day my wedding occurred.\"'\nThe other was a professor of language and of course he was right. But the first man said,\n'Yes, many, many things...' and again started, 'And as I was saying, the day my wedding occurred It is a calamity.'\nIf you are outside of it, it may look like a beautiful oasis in the desert but as you come close the oasis starts drying and disappearing. Once you are caught in it, it is an imprisonment, but remember, the imprisonment doesn't come from the other, it comes from within you.\nIf the left-hemisphere brain goes on dominating you, you will live a very successful life --\nso successful that by the time you are forty you will have ulcers; by the time you are forty-five you will have had at least one or two heart-attacks; by the time you are fifty you will be almost dead -- but successfully dead. You may become a great scientist, but you will never become a great being. You may accumulate enough of wealth, but you will lose all that is of worth. You may conquer the whole world like an Alexander, but your own inner territory will remain unconquered.\nThere are many attractions to follow the left-hemisphere brain -- that is the worldly brain.\nIt is more concerned with things: cars, money, houses, power, prestige. That is the orientation of the man who in India we call a GRUSTHA, a householder.\nThe right-hemisphere brain is the orientation of the SANNYASIN. one who is more interested in his own inner being, his inner peace, his blissfulness, and is less concerned about things. If they come easily, good; if they don't come that is also good. He is more concerned with the moment, less concerned with the future; more concerned with the poetry of life, less concerned with the arithmetic of it.\nI have heard an anecdote.\nFinkelstein had made a huge killing at the races and Muscovitz, quite understandably, was envious.\n'How did you do it, Finkelstein?' he demanded. 'Easy,' said Finkelstein, 'it was a dream.'\n'A dream?'\n'Yes; I had figured out a three-horse parley, but I was not sure about the third horse. Then the night before, I dreamed that an angel was standing over the head of my bed and kept saying, 'Blessings on you, Finkelstein, seven times seven blessings on you.' When I woke up I realized that seven times seven is forty- eight and that horse number seventy-eight was Heavenly Dream. I made Heavenly Dream the third horse in my parley and I just cleaned up, simply cleaned up.'\nMuscovitz said, 'But Finkelstein, seven times seven is forty-nine!' And Finkelstein said, 'So you be the mathematician.'\nThere is a way to follow life through arithmetic and there is another way to follow life through dream -- through dreams and visions. They are totally different.\nJust the other day somebody asked, 'Are there ghosts, fairies, and things like that?' Yes, there are -- if you move through the right-hemisphere brain, there are. If you move through the left-hemisphere brain, there are not. All children are right-hemisphered, they see ghosts and fairies all around, but you go on talking to them and putting them in their places and saying to them, 'Nonsense. You are stupid. Where is the fairy? There is nothing, just a shadow.' By and by you convince the child, the helpless child; by and by you convince him and he moves from the right-hemisphered orientation to the left-hemisphered orientation -- he has to. He has to live in your world: he has to forget his dreams, he has to forget all myth, he has to forget all poetry, he has to learn mathematics.\nOf course he becomes efficient in mathematics -- and becomes almost crippled and paralyzed in life. Existence goes on getting farther and farther away and he becomes just a commodity in the market, his whole life becomes just rubbish... although, of course, valuable in the eyes of the world.\nA SANNYASIN is one who lives through the imagination, who lives through the dreaming quality of his mind, who lives through poetry, who poeticizes about life, who looks through visions. Then trees are greener than they look to you, then birds are more beautiful, then everything takes a luminous quality. Ordinary pebbles become diamonds; ordinary rocks are no longer ordinary -- nothing is ordinary. If you look from the right hemisphere, everything becomes Divine, sacred. Religion is from the right hemisphere.\nA man was sitting with his friend in a cafeteria drinking tea. He studied his cup and said with a sigh, 'Ah, my friend, life is like a cup of tea.'\nThe other considered that for a moment and then said, 'But why? Why is life like a cup of tea?'\nThe first man replied, 'How should I know? Am I a philosopher?'\nThe right-hemisphere brain only makes statements about facts, it cannot give you reasons. If you ask, 'Why?' it can only remain silent, there comes no response from it. If you are walking and you see a lotus flower and you say, 'Beautiful!' -- and somebody says, 'Why?' what will you do? You will say, 'How am I to know? Am I a philosopher?' It is a simple statement, a very simple statement, in itself total, complete. There is no reason behind it and no result beyond it, it is a simple statement of fact. Read the Upanishads --\nthey are simple statements of facts. They say, 'God is. Don't ask why.' They will say, 'Are we philosophers? How are we to know? God is.' They say God is beautiful, they say God is near, closer than your heart, but don't ask why -- they are not philosophers.\nLook at the gospels and the statements of Jesus -- they are simple. He says, 'My God is in heaven. I am his son, he is my father. Don't ask why.' He will not be able to prove it in a court, he will simply say, 'I know.' If you ask him by whom he has been told, by what authority he says these things, he will say, 'It is by my own authority. I have no other authority.' That is the problem when a man like Jesus moves in the world. The rational mind cannot understand, he was not crucified for any other reason. He was crucified by the left hemisphere because he was a right-hemisphere man. He was crucified because of the inner conflict.\nLao Tzu says, 'The whole world seems to be clever, only I am muddle-headed; the whole world seems to be certain, only I am confused and hesitant.' He is a right-hemisphered man.\nThe right hemisphere is the hemisphere of poetry and love. A great shift is needed; that shift is the inner transformation. Yoga is an effort to reach the oneness of being through the left hemisphere, using logic, mathematics, science and trying to go beyond. Zen is just the opposite: the aim is the same but Zen uses the right hemisphere to go beyond.\nBoth can be used, but to follow yoga is a very, very long path; it is almost an unnecessary struggle because you are trying to reach from reason to super-reason which is more difficult. Zen is easier because it is an effort to reach the super- reason from irreason.\nIrreason is almost like super-reason -- there are no barriers. Yoga is like penetrating a wall and Zen is like opening a door. The door may not be closed at all, you just push it a little and it opens.\nNow the story. It is one of the most beautiful among Zen anecdotes. Zen people talk through stories. They have to talk through stories because they cannot create theories and doctrines, they can only tell stories. They are great story-tellers. Jesus goes on talking in parables, Buddha goes on talking in parables, Sufi mystics go on talking in parables -- it is not coincidental. The story, the parable, the anecdote, is the way of the right hemisphere; logic argument, proof, syllogism, is the way of the left hemisphere.\nListen to it.\nGOSO HOYEN USED TO SAY, 'WHEN PEOPLE ASK ME WHAT ZEN IS LIKE, I TELL THEM THIS STORY.'\nThis story really tells what Zen is like -- without defining, it indicates. A definition is not possible because Zen in its basic quality is indefinable. You can taste it but you cannot define it; you can live it but language is not sufficient to say it; you can show it but you cannot say it. But through a story a little bit can be transferred. And this story really indicates, indicates perfectly the quality of what Zen is like. This is just a gesture, don't make it a definition, don't philosophize around it, let it be like lightning, a flash of understanding. It is not going to increase your knowledge but it can give you a shift, a jerk, a change of gestalt. You can be thrown from one corner of the mind to another...and that is the whole point of the story.\nNOTICING THAT HIS FATHER WAS GROWING OLD,\nTHE SON OF A BURGLAR ASKED HIS FATHER TO TEACH HIM THE TRADE\nSO THAT HE COULD CARRY ON THE FAMILY BUSINESS\nAFTER HIS FATHER HAD RETIRED.\nThe trade of a burglar is not a scientific thing: it is an art. Burglars are as much born as poets; you cannot learn, learning won't help. If you learn, you will be caught because then the police know more than you. They have accumulated centuries of learning. A burglar is a born burglar; he lives through intuition, it is a knack; he lives through hunches. A burglar is feminine, he is not a businessman; he is a gambler, he risks all for almost nothing; his whole trade is of danger and risk. It is just like a religious man. Zen people say that religious people are also like burglars: in search of God they are also burglars.\nThere is no way to reach God through logic or reason or accepted society, culture, civilization. They break the wall somewhere, they enter from the back door If in the daylight it is not allowed, they enter in dark. If it is not possible to follow the crowd on the super-highway, they make their own individual paths in the forest. Yes, there is a certain similarity. You can reach God only if you are a burglar, an artist of how to steal the fire, how to steal the treasure.\nThe father was going to retire and the son asked, 'Before you retire teach me your trade.'\nTHE FATHER AGREED, AND THAT NIGHT THEY BROKE INTO A HOUSE\nTOGETHER.\nOPENING A LARGE CHEST THE FATHER TOLD THE SON TO GO IN AND PICK\nOUT THE CLOTHING. AS SOON AS THE BOY WAS INSIDE, THE FATHER\nLOCKED THE CHEST AND THEN MADE A LOT OF NOISE SO THAT THE WHOLE HOUSE WAS AROUSED. THEN HE SLIPPED QUIETLY AWAY.\nA real master he must have been, no ordinary burglar...\nLOCKED INSIDE THE CHEST THE BOY WAS ANGRY, TERRIFIED, AND\nPUZZLED...\nof course, naturally, what type of teaching is this? He had been thrown in a dangerous situation.\nBut that is the only way to teach something of the unknown; that is the only way to teach something of the right-hemisphere brain. The left hemisphere can be taught in schools: learning is possible, discipline is possible, gradual courses are possible. Then by and by, moving from one class to another, you become masters of art and science -- many things.\nBut there cannot be any schools for the right hemisphere: it is intuitive, it is not gradual, it is sudden. It is like a flash, a lightning in the dark night. If it happens, it happens; if it doesn't happen, it doesn't happen -- nothing can be done about it. You can only leave yourself in a certain situation where there is more possibility for it to happen. That's why I say the old man must have been a real master.\nLOCKED INSIDE THE CHEST, THE BOY WAS ANGRY, TERRIFIED, AND\n-- PUZZLED...\nThese are the three states your reason will pass through. In all my meditations the same is being done to you. Locked in a chest, with the key thrown away, first you feel angry.\nMany SANNYASINS come to me and they say they feel very angry with me. I can understand, it is natural -- I am forcing them into situations where their old mind cannot function. That is the root cause of anger. They simply feel impotent, their old mind cannot function, they cannot make anything out of it. What is happening? And when you feel a situation where your mind is simply useless, you feel angry towards me -- angry and then terrified. Then one understands the whole situation and all that you have learned seems absolutely useless...hence fear.\nNow there was no logical way to get out of that chest: it was locked from the outside, the father had made a noise, the whole house was awake, people were moving around, searching, and the father had escaped. Now is there any logical way to get out of this chest? Logic simply fails, reason is of no use. What can you think? Mind suddenly stops -\n- and that is what the father is doing, that is what it is all about. He is trying to force the son into a situation where the logical mind stops, because a burglar does not need a logical mind. If he follows a logical mind he will be caught sooner or later by the police because they also follow the same logic.\nIt happened in the second world war. For three years Adolph Hitler continued to win, and the reason was that he was illogical.. All the other countries that were fighting with him were fighting logically. Of course, they had a great science of war, military training and this and that, and they had experts who would say, 'Now, Hitler is going to attack from this side.' And if Hitler was also in his senses he would have done that because that was the weakest point in the enemy's defense. Of course the enemy has to be attacked where he is the weakest -- it is logical. So they would be expecting Hitler at the weakest point, they would be gathering around the weakest point and he would hit anywhere, unpredictably. He would not even follow his own generals' advice.\nHe had an astrologer who would suggest where to attack. Now this is something never done before -- a war is not run by astrologers. Once Churchill understood, once the spies came with the report that they were not going to win with this man because he was absolutely illogical; that a foolish astrologer who didn't know anything about war, who had never been on the front, was deciding things, deciding by the stars -- what have stars got to do with a war going on on the earth? -- then Churchill immediately appointed a royal astrologer to the king and they started following the royal astrologer. Then things started falling in line because now two fools were predicting Things became easier.\nIf a burglar is going to follow Aristotle he will be caught sooner or later because the same Aristotelian logic is followed by the police. Just few days before, Vedanta did a beautiful thing: he escaped with the ashram jeep. Of course the police had to be informed.\nEverybody was expecting that he would go towards Chanda, because he had been saying that he wanted to go to Chanda and re-open an old ashram which used to be there --\nKailash. Had he gone towards there the police may not have follow, but the police were thinking logically and they said, 'If he had been saying that he was going towards Chanda he will not go to Chanda now because he will be afraid he will be caught on that road. He is not going there.' So they were not worried\nabout that road and, of course, Vedanta was caught in Lonavalla. He was going towards Bombay. But the police also followed the same logic.\nIf you go through logic, then anybody who follows the logical method can catch you anywhere.\nA burglar has to be unpredictable, logic is not possible. He has to be illogical -- so much so that nobody can predict him. But illogic is possible only if your whole energy moves through the right hemisphere.\nLOCKED INSIDE THE CHEST, THE BOY WAS ANGRY, TERRIFIED, AND PUZZLED AS TO HOW HE WAS GOING TO GET OUT.\n'How?' is a logical question. Hence he was terrified because there was no way -- 'How?'\nwas simply impotent. Then an idea flashed to him. Now this is a shift: only in dangerous situations where the left hemisphere cannot function, does it, as a last resort. allow the right hemisphere to have its say. When it cannot function, when it feels that now there is no go, now it is defeated, then it says why not give a chance to the oppressed, to the imprisoned part of the mind? Give that too a chance. Maybe...there can be no harm.\nTHEN AN IDEA FLASHED ON HIM -- HE MADE A NOISE LIKE A CAT.\nNow this is not logical. Making a noise like a cat? Simply an absurd idea. But it worked.\nTHE FAMILY TOLD A MAID TO TAKE A CANDLE AND EXAMINE THE CHEST.\nWHEN THE LID WAS UNLOCKED THE BOY JUMPED OUT, BLEW OUT THE\nCANDLE, PUSHED HIS WAY PAST THE ASTONISHED MAID, AND RAN OUT.\nTHE PEOPLE RAN AFTER HIM.\nNOTICING A WELL BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD THE BOY THREW IN A LARGE STONE, THEN HID IN THE DARKNESS. THE PURSUERS GATHERED\nAROUND THE WELL TRYING TO SEE THE BURGLAR DROWNING HIMSELF.\nThis too is not of the logical mind. Because the logical mind needs time -- the logical mind needs time to proceed, to think, to argue this way and that, all the alternatives -- and there are a thousand and one alternatives. When you are in a situation there is no time to think. If people are pursuing you -- how can you think? Thinking is good when you are sitting in an armchair. With your closed eyes you can philosophize and think and argue, for this and against that, pro and con; but when people are pursuing you and your life is in danger you have no time to think -- one lives in the moment, one simply becomes spontaneous. It is not that he decided to throw the stone, it simply happened. It was not a conclusion, he was not thinking about doing it, he simply found himself doing it. He threw a stone in the well and hid himself in the darkness, and the pursuers stopped, thinking the burglar had drowned himself in the well.\nWHEN THE BOY GOT HOME HE WAS VERY ANGRY AT HIS FATHER AND HE\nTRIED TO TELL HIM THE STORY; BUT THE FATHER SAID: 'DON'T BOTHER\nTO TELL ME THE DETAILS, YOU ARE HERE YOU HAVE LEARNED THE ART.'\nWhat is the point of telling the details? They are useless. Details are useless as far as intuition is concerned because intuition is never a repetition. Details are meaningful as far as logic is concerned. So, logical people go on into minute details so that if the same situation happens again they will be in control and they will know what to do.\nBut in the life of a burglar the same situation never happens again. And in real life also the same situation never happens again. If you have conclusions in your mind you will become almost dead, you will not be responding. In life, response is needed, not reaction: you have to act out of nowhere, with no conclusions inside. With no center you have to act -- you have to act into the unknown from\nthe unknown.\nAnd this is what Goso Hoyen used to say when people asked him what Zen is like. This story he would tell.\nZen is exactly like burglary: it is an art, it is not a science; it is feminine, it is not male; it is not aggressive, it is receptive; it is not a well-planned methodology; it is a spontaneity.\nIt has nothing to do with theories, hypotheses, doctrines, scriptures; it has something to do with only one thing -- that is, awareness.\nWhat happened in that moment when the boy was inside the chest? In such a danger you cannot be sleepy, in such a danger your consciousness becomes very sharp, has to. Life is at stake, you are totally awake -- that's how one should be totally awake each moment.\nAnd when you are totally awake, this shift happens: from the left hemisphere the energy moves to the right hemisphere. Whenever you are alert, you become intuitive; flashes come to you, flashes from the unknown, out of the blue. You may not follow them -- then you will miss much.\nIn fact all the great discoveries in science come from the right hemisphere also, not from the left. You must have heard about Madam Curie, the only woman who got a Nobel Prize. She had been working hard for three years on a certain mathematical problem but could not solve it. She worked hard. argued from this way and that, but there was no way.\nOne night. tired. exhausted. she fell asleep -- and while she was falling asleep then too she was trying to solve the problem. In the night she awoke. walked, wrote the answer on some paper. came back. and went to sleep. In the morning she found the answer there on the table but she could not believe who had done it. Nobody could do it! The servant --\nyou could not expect him to do it; he did not know anything about mathematics. She remembered well that last night she had tried her best and could not do it. What had happened? Then she tried to remember -- because the handwriting was hers. She tried to remember...and then a faint remembrance came: as if in a dream she had walked to the table and written.\nFrom where had this answer come? It could not be from the left hemisphere. the left had been working hard for three years. And there was no process on the paper, just the conclusion. If it had come from the left there would have been a process, it goes step by step. But this was like a flash -- the same kind of flash that had happened to the boy in the chest. The left hemisphere, tired, exhausted, helpless, sought the help of the right hemisphere.\nWhenever you are in such a corner that your logic fails, don't be desperate, don't become hopeless. Those moments may prove the greatest blessings in your life: those are the moments that the left allows the right to have its way. Then the feminine part, the receptive part. gives you an idea. If you follow it. many doors will be opened. But it is possible you may miss it; you may say. 'What nonsense!'\nThis boy could have missed. The idea is not very normal, regular, logical. Make a noise like a cat? For what? He could have asked, 'Why? and then he would have missed. But he could not ask because the situation was such that there was no other way. So he thought,\n'Let us try. What is wrong in it?' He used the clue.\nThe father was right. He said, 'Don't go into details. they are not important. You are back home, you have learned the art.'\nThe whole art is how to function from the feminine part of the mind. because the feminine is joined with the Whole and the male is not joined with the Whole. The male is aggressive, the male is constantly in struggle -- the feminine is constantly in surrender, in deep trust. Hence the feminine body is so beautiful, so round. There is a deep trust and a deep harmony with nature. A woman lives in deep surrender -- a man is constantly fighting, angry, doing this and that, trying to prove something, trying to reach somewhere. A woman is happy, not trying to reach anywhere. Ask women if they would like to go to the moon. They will simply be amazed. For what? What is the point? Why take such trouble? The home is perfectly good. The woman is not interested in what is happening in Vietnam and what is happening in Korea and what is happening in Israel She is at the most interested in what is happening in the neighborhood, at the most interested in who has fallen in love with whom, who has escaped with whom... in gossips not in politics. She is more interested in the immediate, here now, and that gives her a harmony, a grace. Man is constantly trying to prove something. and if you want to prove of course you have to fight and compete and\naccumulate.\nOnce a woman tried to get Dr. Johnson to talk with her but he seemed to take very little notice of her.\n'Why, Doctor,' she said archly, 'I believe you prefer the company of men to that of women.'\n'Madam,' replied Johnson, 'I am very fond of the company of ladies. I like their beauty, I like their delicacy, I like their vivacity, and I like their silence.'\nMan has been forcing woman to be silent, not only outside, inside also -- forcing the feminine part to keep quiet. Just watch within you. If the feminine part says something you immediately jump upon it and you say, 'Logical? Absurd!' People come to me and they say. 'The heart says we would like to become SANNYASINS but the head says no...'\nDr. Johnson, trying to keep the woman silent. The heart is feminine.\nYou miss much in your life because the head goes on talking; it does not allow. And the only quality in the head is that it is more articulate, cunning, dangerous, violent. Because of its violence it has become the leader inside, and that inside leadership has become an outside leadership for man. Man has dominated women in the outside world also; the grace is dominated by violence.\nI was invited to a school for a certain function. There was a rally of school- children and in the rally the procession had been arranged according to height -- from the shortest up to the tallest. But the pattern was broken, I noticed, by the first boy heading the procession. He was a gangling youth who looked a head taller than the rest. 'Why is he at the front?'\nI asked a young girl, 'Is he the leader of the school, the captain, or something like that?'\n'No,' she whispered, 'he pinches.'\nThe male mind goes on pinching, creating trouble. Trouble-makers become leaders. In the schools, all wise teachers choose the greatest trouble-makers as captains of the classes and the schools -- the trouble-makers. the criminals. Once they are in a powerful post their whole energy for trouble-making becomes\nhelpful for the teacher. They start creating discipline -- the same ones.\nJust watch the politicians in the world: when one party is in power the opposite party goes on creating trouble in the country. They are the law-breakers, the revolutionaries.\nAnd the party which is in power goes on creating discipline. Once they are thrown out of power, they will create trouble. and once the opposite party comes into power they become the guardians of discipline.\nThey are all trouble-makers.\nThe male mind is a trouble-making phenomenon -- hence it overpowers. it dominates.\nBut deep down. although you may attain power, you miss life -- and deep down, the feminine mind continues. Unless you fall back to the feminine and you surrender. unless your resistance and struggle become surrender. you will not know what real life, and the celebration of it, is.\nI have heard one anecdote.\nAn American scientist once visited the offices of the great Nobel prize-winning physicist, Niels Bohr, in Copenhagen, and was amazed to find that over his desk was a horseshoe, securely nailed to the wall with the open end up in the approved manner so it would catch the good luck and not let it spill out.\nThe American said with a nervous laugh, 'Surely you don't believe the horseshoe will bring you good luck, do you, Professor Bohr? After all, as a level-headed scientist '\nBohr chuckled, 'I believe in no such thing, my good friend, not at all. I am scarcely likely to believe in such foolish nonsense. However, I am told that a horseshoe will bring you good luck whether you believe in it or not.'\nLook a little deeper, and just underneath your logic you will find fresh waters of intuition, fresh waters of trust, flowing.\nYoga is a way to use reason to reach God -- of course very difficult, and the longest path.\nIf you follow Patanjali you are trying to do that which can happen without doing; you are trying hard to do something. You are trying to pull yourself by shoe- strings -- to pull yourself up.\nZen is the way of the spontaneous -- the effortless effort, the way of intuition.\nA Zen Master, Ikkyu, a great poet, has said: I can see clouds a thousand miles away, hear ancient music in the pines.\nThis is what Zen is all about. You cannot see clouds a thousand miles away with the logical mind. The logical mind is like glass, too dirty, too covered with the dust of ideas, theories, doctrines. But you can see clouds a thousand miles away with the pure glass of intuition, with no thoughts -- just pure awareness. The mirror is clean and the clarity supreme.\nYou cannot hear ancient music in the pines with the ordinary logical mind. How can you hear the ancient music? Music once gone is gone forever.\nBut I tell you, Ikkyu is right. You can hear ancient music in the pines -- I have heard it --\nbut a shift, a total change, a change of gestalt, is needed. Then you can see Buddha preaching again and you can hear Buddha speaking again. You can hear the ancient music in the pines because it is eternal music, it is never lost. You have lost the capacity to hear it. The music is eternal; once you regain your capacity, suddenly it is there again.\nIt has always been there, only you were not there. Be here now and you can also see clouds a thousand miles away, and hear ancient music in the pines.\nChange more and more towards the right hemisphere, become more and more feminine, more and more loving, surrendering, trusting, more and more closer to the Whole. Don't try to be an island -- become part of the continent.\nAncient Music in the Pines Chapter #2\nChapter title: A thousand and one bifurcations\n22 February 1976 am in Buddha Hall Archive\ncode:\n7602220\nShortTitle:\nANCIEN02\nAudio:\nYes Video: No Length:\n101\nmins\nThe first question:\nQuestion 1\nYOU TOLD ME THAT MY MIND IS IMMATURE. WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO\nHAVE A MIND THAT IS MATURE?\nTo think that you know is to be immature. To function from knowledge, from conclusion, is to be immature. To function from no-knowledge, from no conclusion, from no past, is maturity.\nMaturity is deep trust in your own consciousness; immaturity is a distrust in your own consciousness. When you distrust your consciousness you trust your knowledge, but that is a substitute and a very poor substitute at that. Try to understand this -- it is important.\nYou have been living, you have experienced many things; you have read, you have listened, you have thought. Now all those conclusions are there. When a certain situation arises. you can function in two ways. You can function through all the accumulated past, according to it -- that's what I mean by functioning through a center. through conclusions, through experience, stale, dead -- then whatsoever you do your response is not going to be a response, it will be a reaction. And to be reactionary is to be immature.\nOr, if you can function right now, here in this moment, through your consciousness, through your being aware, putting aside all that you have known\n-- this is what I call functioning through no-knowledge, this is functioning through innocence. And this is maturity.\nI was reading one anecdote.\nIt seemed to Mr. Smith that now that his son had turned thirteen, it was important to discuss those matters which an adolescent ought to know about life. So he called the boy into the study one evening. shut the door carefully, and said with impressive dignity.\n'Son, I would like to discuss the facts of life with you.'\n'Sure thing, Dad.' said the boy. 'What do you want to know?'\nThe mind is immature when it is not ready to learn. The ego feels very fulfilled if it need not learn anything from anybody; the ego feels very enhanced if it feels that it already knows. But the problem is that life goes on changing, it is never the same; it goes on flowing, it is a flux. And your knowledge is always the same. Your knowledge is not evolving with life, it is stuck somewhere in the past, and whenever you react through it you will miss the point because it will not be exactly the right thing to do. Life has changed but your knowledge remains the same. and you act out of this knowledge. That means you face today with your yesterday's knowledge. You will never be able to be alive. The more you function through knowledge, the more immature you become.\nNow let me tell you a paradox: every child who is innocent is mature.\nMaturity has nothing to do with age because it has nothing to do with experience; maturity has something to do with responsiveness, freshness, virginity, innocence. So when I use the word 'mature' I don't mean that when you\nbecome more experienced you will be more mature. That's what people usually mean when they use the word -- I don't mean that. The more you gather knowledge, the more your mind will become immature; and by the time you are seventy or eighty, you will be completely immature because you will have a stale past to function through. Watch a small child...knowing nothing, having no experience, he functions here and now.\nThat's why children can learn more than aged people. Psychologists say that if a child is not forced to learn, not forced to discipline himself, he can learn any foreign language in three months. Just left to himself with people who know the language he will catch it in three months. But if you force him to learn, it will take almost three years, because the more you force, the more he starts functioning through whatsoever he learns, through yesterday's knowledge. If he is left to himself he moves freely, spontaneously; learning comes easy, by itself, on its own accord.\nBy the time the child reaches the year eight he has learned almost seventy per cent of whatsoever he is going to learn in his whole life. He may live eighty years, but by the time he is eight he has learned seventy per cent -- he will learn only thirty per cent more, and every day his capacity to learn will be less and less and less. The more he knows, the less he learns. When people use the word 'maturity' they mean more knowledge; when I use the word 'maturity' I mean the capacity to learn. Not to know but to learn -- and they are different, totally different, diametrically opposite things. Knowledge is a dead thing; the capacity to learn is an alive process -- you simply remain capable of learning, you simply remain available, you simply remain open, ready to receive. Learning is receptivity. Knowledge makes you less receptive because you go on thinking that if you already know, what is there to learn? When you already know. you miss much; when you don't know anything you cannot miss anything.\nSocrates said in his old age, 'Now I know nothing!' That was maturity. At the very end he said, 'I know nothing.'\nLife is so vast. How can this tiny mind know? At the most, glimpses are enough. Even they are too much. Existence is so tremendously vast and infinite, beginningless, endless... how can this tiny drop of consciousness know it? It is enough even that a few glimpses come, a few doors open, a few moments happen when you come in contact with existence. But those moments cannot be turned into knowledge.\nAnd your mind tends to do it -- then it becomes more and more immature.\nSo the first thing is that you should be capable of learning and your learning capacity should never be burdened by knowledge, never be covered by dust. The mirror of learning should remain clean and fresh so it can go on reflecting.\nThe mind can function in two ways. It can function like a camera: once exposed, finished\n-- the film immediately becomes knowledgeable and it loses its learning capacity.\nExposed once and it already knows -- now it is useless; now it is not capable of learning more. If you expose it again and again it will become more confused. That's why people who know too much are always afraid of learning... because they will become confused.\nThey are already exposed films. Then there is another type of learning -- learning like a mirror. Expose the mirror for a thousand and one times, it makes no difference -- if you come in front of the mirror, you are reflected: if you go, the reflection goes. The mirror never accumulates.\nThe film in the camera immediately accumulates -- it catches hold, clings, but the mirror simply mirrors: you come in front, you are in it; you go, you are gone.\nThis is the way to remain mature. Every child is born mature and almost all people die immature. This will look very paradoxical but this is so. Remain innocent and you will remain mature.\nThe second thing is that the immature mind is always interested in trivia. The immature mind is always interested in things: money, houses, cars, power, prestige...all trivia, all rot. The mature mind is interested in existence, in being, in life itself. So when I say to you that you have an immature mind I mean you are still interested in things, not in persons; still interested in the outside, not in the inside; still interested in objects, not in subjectivity; still interested in the finite, not interested in the infinite.\nJust watch your mind -- where it moves, what its fantasies are. If you find a valuable diamond on the road and just there by its side a rose has flowered, in what will you be interested? In the rose or in the diamond? You will not be able\nto see the rose if you are interested in the diamond; you will simply miss the rose, it is valueless. Your eyes will be too clouded by the diamond, your whole mind will become focused on the diamond, and you will miss another diamond which was more alive -- the rose.\nIn the Hindu paradise they say roses are not ordinary roses, they are made of diamonds. I don't know, but I have seen roses. If you can see roses here exactly on this earth, they are made of diamonds -- so why go far away? Not in paradise but here now, once you know how to see a rose there is nothing comparable to it. And once you can see the rose you may forget completely about the diamond.\nIt happened that Mulla Nasruddin came to me one day. He was very much worried and he said, 'Ah, poor Mr. Jones. Did you hear, Osho, what happened to him? He tripped at the top of the stairs, fell down the whole flight, banged his head and died.'\nShocked, I said, 'Died?'\n'Died,' he repeated with emphasis, 'and broke his glasses too!'\nThe immature mind is more interested in glasses than in life and death and love; more interested in things, like houses and cars. When I tell you that you have an immature mind, I mean you are still interested in that which is worthless, non- essential. At the most it can be used, at the most it can become a decoration in life, but it cannot replace life, it cannot substitute life, it cannot become life itself.\nAnd there are many people who have made it a life. I know a few rich people who live such beggarly lives -- one cannot imagine it.\nI used to know a man in Delhi who had six bungalows, all out on rent. And he lived in a small dark cell with no children and no wife.\nI asked him once, 'You have enough. Why do you go on living in this small dark cell?\nWhy have you imposed this imprisonment upon yourself? What penance are you doing?'\nHe said, 'None. I have always lived this way and it is perfectly beautiful. And\npeople are living in those six bungalows.'\nHe goes to those bungalows only to collect rent. I asked him, 'Why have you never married?'\n'I am a poor man and women are very costly. I could not afford it,' he said.\nIf you meet that man you will not be able to recognize that he owns six big houses and earns a lot of money. What has happened to this man? He is more interested in money than he is in himself, he is more interested in money than he is in love, he is more interested in the power that money brings -- but he has never shared anything with anybody.\nThese people are not rare, they are very common. Everybody has such a tendency inside.\nAnd people go on rationalizing. Man is very clever -- he says, 'This is not miserliness.\nDon't misunderstand me. I am a simple man. I live a simple life. I am a religious man, and a simple life is beautiful.'\nIf you are too interested in things you are immature. Shift your attention. Become more and more interested in people rather than in yourself.\nI have a SANNYASIN here, Nisha. She always falls in love with beggarly people and she is tremendously rich. Just a few days before, she came and asked 'Why, Osho, do I go on falling in love with beggarly people -- people who are almost on the street?' I know the reason... with a beggarly man she need not be worried about her money. And she thinks that she helps these people -- by food, by small things -- in fact she has never fallen in love. She is so much in love with money that she cannot fall in love with persons. She purchases these people for money -- they are without any cost, without any risk. And they feel obliged because she gives food, clothing, shelter -- they feel obliged, so they pretend that they love her, and she goes on pretending that she has fallen in love. This is a way to protect the money and this is a way to remain closed, miserly.\nAnd she is suffering, in pain, but she cannot see the point. She has to learn how to share.\nIf you know how to share, you are mature; if you don't know how to share, you are immature.\nThis sharing goes on on all levels, in all directions, in all dimensions. So one of the most basic things to understand is the more you share something, the more it grows in you.\nShare whatsoever you have and it will grow; cling to it, become afraid of sharing, of friendship, of love, and it will shrink'. Life knows only one law and that law is of expansion and sharing.\nLook at nature. Nature is such a spendthrift. When one flower is needed, a thousand and one flowers will bloom. When you make love to a woman or to a man, in each orgasm millions of cells are released. One would have been enough because at the most one child can be conceived, but millions of cells are released. One man can populate the whole earth -- just one man! One ordinary man has at least four thousand intercourses in his life -- one ordinary man -- and in each intercourse millions of cells are released. The whole world, the whole population that exists right now, can be produced by one man.\nAnd yet the man will become the father of only two or three, if in the West; or twelve, fourteen, fifteen, if in the East -- that's all. For fifteen persons to be conceived, millions of cells are released.\nNature is a spendthrift. Where one flower is needed it produces millions. One tree will produce.… Look at the Gulmohr -- millions of seeds are ready. They will all fall down and a few, one, two, four, five, ten, twenty, a hundred, may become trees. Why so many seeds? God is not a miser. If you ask for one he gives millions. Just ask! Jesus has said,\n'Knock and the doors shall be opened unto you, ask and it shall be given.' Remember, if you ask for one, millions will be given.\nThe moment you become miserly you are closed to the basic phenomenon of life: expansion, sharing. The moment you start clinging to things, you have missed the target\n-- you have missed. Because things are not the target, you, your innermost being, is the target -- not a beautiful house, but a beautiful you; not much money, but a rich you; not many things, but an open being, available to millions of things.\nWhen I say you are immature, I mean you are too concerned with things and you have not yet learned that life consists of consciousness -- of beings, not of things. Things are to be used, they are needed, but don't start living by them. Man cannot live by bread alone -- once living by bread alone, things alone, you are already dead.\nAnd the third thing: maturity is always spontaneous. It does not plan, it makes no rehearsals.\nPeople come to me.… Just the other night somebody was there. He said, 'I prepare so many questions when I come to see you. but when I come here I forget. What do you do to me?' I am not doing anything at all. It is YOU. The moment you prepare something you are already saying that it is false. The real thing need not be prepared. In life.\nrehearsals are not needed, they are needed in a drama. A drama is a false thing. If you prepare your questions it means that those questions are not yours. If you are thirsty and you come to me, will you forget that you are thirsty and you would like your thirst to be quenched? How can you forget? In fact, when you reach the side of a river thirst will burn more intensely. The moment you see water flowing, and hear the sound of gurgling, immediately all that you have been suppressing will bubble up, it will respond, your whole being will say, 'I am thirsty!' If you are thirsty you will not forget.\nBut you prepare questions. You prepare yourself to go to the river and say, 'I am very thirsty.' What is the point of preparing? If you are thirsty, you are; if you are not, by the time you reach to the river, you will forget about it.\nWhen I say you are immature I mean that you prepare your questions, your inquiries.\nThey are mind things. they don't come from your heart, they are not related to you, they have no roots in you.\nIt is related in George Bernard Shaw's life that once, at the opening of one of his plays, he stepped forward at its conclusion with obvious complaisance, to accept the rousing plaudits of the crowd. There was one dissenter, however, who seized the occasion of a lull in the applause to call out in stentorian tones, 'Your play stinks!'\nThere was a momentary horrified silence, but Shaw, unperturbed, exclaimed from the stage, 'My friend, I agree with you completely, but what are we two' -- here he waved his hand over the audience -- 'against the great majority?'\nAnd applause returned more loudly than ever.\nYou cannot prepare something like that, it is impossible It is a spontaneous response --\nhence the beauty of it. You cannot prepare for such things. And life is such a continuous thing: either you act or you miss. Later on, you will find a thousand and one answers --\nyou could have said this, you could have said that -- but they are of no use.\nMark Twain was coming back home with his wife from a lecture hall. He had just delivered a beautiful talk. His wife had not been present, she had just come to pick him up.\nOn the way she asked, 'How was the lecture?'\nMark Twain said, 'Which one? The one that I prepared, or the one that I delivered, or the one that I am thinking now that I should have delivered? Which one?'\nIf you prepare, this is going to be so. Remain conscious, alert, aware, and act out of your spontaneity. And not only will others see the alive response of it, you also will be thrilled by your own response. Not only will others be surprised, you will also be surprised yourself.\nI call a mind mature which retains the capacity to be surprised. A mind is mature if it goes on continuously being surprised. by others, by himself, by everything. Life is a constant wonder: he has no ready-made plans or ready-made responses for it, he never knows what is going to happen, he moves into the unknown each moment. And he never jumps ahead of himself, he never lags behind himself, he remains simply himself, wherever he is.\nAnd, the last and most basic thing: when I say that you have an immature mind, basically I mean that you have a mind. Mind as such is immature; only no-mind is mature.\nMaturity has nothing to do with mind because mind means all that you know; mind means your experiences, mind means your past, your rehearsals, your preparations. All these things are implied in the word 'mind.' Mind is not something in particular, it is the whole accumulation, all the junk, the whole heap, of your dead past.\nWhen I say, 'Be mature,' I mean become a no-mind. If you act spontaneously, you will act out of no-mind. If you remain capable of learning, you will remain capable of being a no-mind again and again and again -- the mind will never be accumulated. If you are capable of remaining alert-and spontaneous, able to be surprised by life and by yourself, you will become by and by more and more interested in the interior-most life, in the core of life. When you see a person, you will not see just the body, your gaze will become penetrating, your gaze will become like an x-ray. It will catch hold of the person -- of the consciousness there, of the inner light there in the other person. The body is just an abode -- you will meet the person, you will shake hands, but not only hands, you will shake the person, you will meet the person. And in your own life, by and by, you will become aware that the body is just the outermost garment: you have to take care of it, it is not to be neglected, it is valuable, but it is not the end. You are the master, not the servant. And by and by, the more you penetrate withinwards, you will see that the mind also is an innermost garment -- more valuable than the body but not more valuable than you. You remain the supreme value.\nOnce you know your supreme value, you have become mature; and once you know your supreme value, you know the supreme value of all: all beings are Buddhas -- nobody is less than that; the whole of life is Divine; you are always walking on holy ground.\nIt is said that when Moses went to the hill to meet his God, the bush was afire and from behind the bush he heard, 'Stop! Take your shoes off. This is holy ground.' I have always liked it, loved it. But all ground is holy ground and all bushes are afire with God. If you have not seen this yet you have missed much. Look again. All bushes are afire with God and from every bush comes the commandment, 'Stop and take your shoes off. It is holy ground you are walking on. All ground, the whole earth, the whole existence is sacred.\nOnce you have that feeling entering you, I will call you mature -- not before that. A mature mind is a religious mind.\nThe second question:\nQuestion 2\nWHY DO I MAKE MOUNTAINS OUT OF MOLEHILLS?\nBecause the ego does not feel good, at ease, with molehills -- it wants mountains. Even if it is a misery, it should not be a molehill, it should be an Everest. Even if it is miserable, the ego doesn't want to be ordinarily miserable -- it wants to be extraordinarily miserable!\nBernard Shaw is reported to have said, 'If I am not going to be the first in heaven, I would like to go to hell...but I would like to be the first.' In Christianity there is only one hell and Bernard Shaw never knew that in India we have a concept of seven hells. If he had heard about Hindu hells he would have chosen the seventh, because in the fifth he would have felt humiliated, others are still far ahead of him in the seventh -- the real sinners, the great sinners, are in the seventh!\nEither this way or that -- but one wants to be the first. Hence one goes on making mountains out of molehills.\nOne woman hypochondriac died. The whole town felt relieved, the whole medical profession felt relieved, because she was a constant trouble to many people's heads, everywhere, all around. The family, the doctors, the physicians -- she had troubled everybody and nobody was of any help. And she relished the idea that nobody knew anything about the sort of disease she was suffering from\n-- it was an extraordinary disease. In fact there was no disease.\nThen she died, and it was almost a celebration in the town. But when they opened the will, she had written in her will that her request had positively to be fulfilled. Her request was that a carved tombstone had to be put on her tomb with these words inscribed on it: Now will you believe I was sick?\nIn this way she would haunt the whole town again.\nPeople go on and on, creating big problems out of nothing. I have talked to thousands of people about their problems and I have not come across a real problem yet! All problems are bogus -- you create them. Because without problems you feel empty... then there is nothing to do, nothing to fight with,\nnowhere to go. People go from one guru to another, from one master to another, from one psychoanalyst to another, from one encounter group to another, because if they don't go, they feel empty, and they suddenly feel life to be meaningless. You create problems so that you can feel that life is a great work, a growth, and you have to struggle hard.\nThe ego can exist only when it struggles, remember -- when it fights. And if I tell you,\n'Kill three flies and you will become enlightened, you will not believe me. You will say,\n'Three flies? There doesn't seem to be much to that. And I will become enlightened? That doesn't seem to be likely. If I say you will have to kill seven hundred lions, of course that looks more like it!\nThe greater the problem, the greater the challenge -- and with challenge your ego arises, soars high. You create problems. Problems don't exist.\nAnd now if you allow me, there are not even molehills. That too is your trick. You say,\n'Yes, there may not be mountains, but molehills?' No, not even molehills are there --\nthose are your creations. First you create molehills out of nothing, then you create mountains out of molehills. And the priests and the psychoanalysts and the gurus, they are happy because their whole trade exists because of you. If you don't create molehills out of nothing and you don't make your molehills into mountains, what will be the point of gurus helping you? First you have to be in a shape to be helped.\nThe real masters have been saying something else. They have been saying, 'Please look what you are doing, what nonsense you are doing. First you create a problem, then you go in search of a solution. Just watch why you are creating the problem, just exactly in the beginning, when you are creating the problem, is the solution -- don't create it!' But that won't appeal to you because then you are suddenly thrown flat upon yourself.\nNothing to do? No enlightenment? No satori? No samadhi? And you are deeply\nrestless, empty, trying to stuff yourself with anything whatsoever. You don't have any problems -- only this much has to be understood.\nThis very moment you can drop all problems\nbecause they are your creations. Have another look at your problems: the deeper you look, the smaller they will appear. Go on looking at them and by and by they will start disappearing. Go on gazing and suddenly you will find there is emptiness -- a beautiful emptiness surrounds you. Nothing to do, nothing to be, because you are already that.\nEnlightenment is not something to be achieved, it is just to be lived. When I say that I achieved enlightenment, I simply mean that I decided to live it. Enough is enough! And since then I have lived it. It is a decision that now you are not interested in creating problems -- that's all. It is a decision that now you are finished with all this nonsense of creating problems and finding solutions.\nAll this nonsense is a game you are playing with yourself: you yourself are hiding and you yourself are seeking, you are both the parties. And you know it! That's why when I say it you smile, you laugh. I am not talking about anything ridiculous -- you understand it. You are laughing at yourself. Just watch yourself laughing, just look at your own smile\n-- you understand it. It has to be so because it is your own game: you are hiding and waiting for yourself to be able to seek and find yourself.\nYou can find yourself right now because it is you that is hiding. That's why Zen masters go on hitting. Whenever somebody comes and says, 'l would like to be a Buddha, the master gets very angry. Because he is asking nonsense, he IS a Buddha. If Buddha comes to me and asks how to be a Buddha, what am I supposed to do? I will hit his head.\n'Whom do you think you are befooling? You are a Buddha.'\nDon't make unnecessary trouble for yourself. And understanding will dawn on you if you watch how you make a problem bigger and bigger and bigger, how you spin it, and how you help the wheel to move faster and faster and faster. Then suddenly you are at the top of your misery and you are in need of the whole world's sympathy.\nOne sannyasin, Marga, wrote me a letter. She said, 'Osho, I feel very sad because when you talk, you look at everyone except me.' Now, I am not looking at anybody, but I have got eyes, so they have to be somewhere. It is not that I am looking at somebody, I am not looking at anybody. And you can see in my eyes that they are empty, they are vacant. But if you are trying to find your reflection in them and you don't, great sadness comes to you. Now there is a new problem. Now the ego feels hurt -- looking at everybody else except you! Just watch how you have made yourself an exception; extraordinary you have become. I look at everybody, the ordinary mass, except you. You have become unique. If I look at Marga -- which I am not going to do! Since I received her letter, I am never going to look at her -- if I look at her then the ego can have another trip: that I look only at her. Then that will create a problem!\nYou are a great problem-creator... just understand this and suddenly problems disappear.\nYou are perfectly in shape; you are born perfect, that is the whole message. You are born perfect; perfection is your innermost nature. You have just to live it. Decide, and live it.\nBut if you are not yet fed up with the game you can continue, but don't ask why. You know. The why is simple: the ego cannot exist in emptiness, it needs something to fight with. Even a ghost of your imagination will do, but you need to fight with someone. The ego exists only in conflict, the ego is not an entity, it is a tension. Whenever there is a conflict, the tension arises and the ego exists;' when there is no conflict the tension disappears and the ego disappears. Ego is not a thing -- it is just a tension.\nAnd of course nobody wants small tensions, everybody wants big tensions. If your own problems are not enough, you start thinking about humanity and the world and the future... socialism, communism, and all that rubbish. You start thinking about it as if the whole world depends on your advice. Then you think, 'What is going to happen in Israel?\nWhat is going to happen in Africa?' And you go on advising, and you create problems.\nPeople become very excited, they cannot sleep because there is some war going on. They become very excited. Their own life is so ordinary that they will have\nto reach extraordinariness from some other source. The nation is in difficulty so they become identified with the nation. The culture is in difficulty, the society is in difficulty -- now there are big problems and you become identified. You are a Hindu and the Hindu culture is in difficulty; you are a Christian and the church is in difficulty. The whole world is at stake. Now you become big through your problem.\nThe ego needs some problems. If you understand this, in the very understanding the mountains become molehills again, and then the molehills also disappear. Suddenly there is emptiness, pure emptiness all around. This is what enlightenment is all about -- a deep understanding that there is no problem.\nThen, with no problem to solve, what will you do? Immediately you start living. You will eat, you will sleep, you will love, you will have a chit-chat, you will sing, you will dance\n-- what else is there to do? You have become a God, you have started living.\nIf there is any God, one thing is certain: he will not have any problems. That much is certain. Then what is he doing with all his time? No problems, no psychiatrist to consult, no gurus to go and surrender to... what is God doing? What will he do? He must be getting crazy, whirling. No, he is living; his life is totally full with life. He is eating, sleeping, dancing, having a love affair -- but without any problems.\nStart living this moment and you will see that the more you live, the less problems there are. Because now that your emptiness is flowering and living there is no need. When you don't live, the same energy goes sour. The same energy which would have become a flower, is stuck; not being allowed to bloom it becomes a thorn in the heart. It is the same energy.\nForce a small child to sit in the corner and tell him to become completely immobile, unmoving. Watch what happens...just a few minutes before, he was perfectly at ease, flowing; now his face will become red because he will have to strain, hold himself. His whole body will become rigid and he will try to fidget here and there and he will want to jump out of himself. You have forced the energy -- now it has no purpose, no meaning, no space to move, nowhere to bloom and flower; it is stuck, frozen, rigid. The child is suffering a short death, a temporary death. Now if you don't allow the child to run again and move around\nthe garden and play, he will start creating problems, he will fantasize; in his mind he will Create problems and start fighting with those problems. He will see a big dog and he will get afraid, or he will see a ghost and he will have to fight and escape from him. Now he is creating problems. The same energy that was just a moment before flowing all around, in all directions, is stuck and becoming sour.\nIf people can dance a little more, sing a little more, be a little more crazy, their energy will be flowing more, and their problems will by and by disappear. Hence I insist so much on dance. Dance to orgasm; let the whole energy become dance, and suddenly you will see that you don't have any head -- the stuck energy in the head is moving all around, creating beautiful patterns, pictures, movement. And when you dance there comes a moment when your body is no longer a rigid thing, it becomes flexible, flowing.\nWhen you dance there comes a moment when your boundary is no longer so clear; you melt and merge with the cosmos, the boundaries are mixing.\nWatch a dancer -- you will see that he has become an energy phenomenon, no longer in a fixed form, no longer in a frame. He is flowing out of his frame, out OT his form, and becoming more alive, more and more alive. But only if you dance yourself will you know what really happens. The head inside disappears; again you are a child. Then you don't create any problems.\nLive, dance, eat, sleep, do things as totally as possible. And remember again and again: whenever you catch yourself creating any problem, slip out of it, immediately. Once you get into the problem then a solution will be needed. And even if you find a solution, out of that solution a thousand and one problems will arise again. Once you miss the first step you are in the trap. Whenever you see that now you are slipping into a problem, catch hold of yourself, run, jump, dance, but don't get into the problem. Do something immediately so that the energy that was creating the problems becomes fluid, unfrozen, melts, goes back to the cosmos.\nPrimitive people don't have many problems. I have come across primitive groups in India who say they don't dream at all. Freud would not be able to believe that it is possible.\nThey don't dream, but if sometimes somebody dreams -- it is a rare phenomenon\n-- the whole village fasts, prays to God. Something has gone wrong, something wrong has happened... a man has dreamed.\nIt never happens in their tribe because they live so totally that nothing is left in the head to be completed in the sleep. Whatsoever you leave incomplete has to be completed in your dreams; whatsoever you have not lived remains as a hang- over and completes itself in the mind -- that's what a dream is. The whole day you go on thinking. The thinking simply shows that you have more energy than you use for living; you have more energy than your so-called life needs.\nYou are missing real life. Use more energy. Then fresh energies will be flowing. Just don't be a miser. Use them today; let today be complete unto itself; tomorrow will take care of itself, don't be worried about tomorrow. The worry, the problem, the anxiety, all simply show one thing: that you are not living rightly, that your life is not yet a celebration, a dance, a festivity. Hence all the problems.\nIf you live, ego disappears. Life knows no ego, it knows only living and living and living.\nLife knows no self, no center; life knows no separation. You breathe -- life enters into you; you exhale you enter into life. There is no separation. You eat, and trees enter into you through the fruit. Then one day you die, you are buried in the earth, and the trees suck you up and you become fruits. Your children will eat you again. You have been eating your ancestors -- the trees have converted them into fruits. You think you are a vegetarian? Don't be deceived by appearances. We are all cannibals.\nLife is one, it goes on moving. It comes into you; it passes through you. In fact to say that it comes into you isn't right, because then it seems as if life comes into you, and then passes out of you. You don't exist -- only this life's coming and going does. You don't exist -- only life exists in its tremendous forms, in its energy, in its millions of delights.\nOnce you understand this, let that understanding be the only law.\nAnd start living as Buddhas from this very moment. If you decide otherwise, it is for you to decide -- but as I see it, it is a decision: 'I am not going to befool myself anymore.\nNow I start living as a Buddha, in emptiness. I will not try to find unnecessary occupations. I dissolve.'\nThe third question:\nQuestion 3\nI NOTICE THAT DEEP DOWN I WANT TO BE LOVED, ACCEPTED, LIKE THE\nGREATEST MAN ON EARTH, THAT I WANT TO BE THE MOST FAMOUS\nPERSON. AND I FEEL HURT WHEN SOMEONE REJECTS ME. WHAT TO DO\nWITH THESE DREAMS?\nIf you understand that they are dreams then wash your face and have a cup of tea. What is there to be done about it? Dreams are dreams -- why be bothered?\nBut you don't understand that they are dreams. This is borrowed. You know that they are not dreams -- that s why you are worried. Otherwise why be worried? If in a dream you see that you have fallen ill, when you wake up in the morning do you go to the doctor?\nIn my dream I was very ill and now some medication is needed. You never go. You realize it was a dream -- finished! What is the point of going to a doctor?\nBut you have not yet understood that these are dreams. These are realities for you --\nhence the problem.\nI NOTICE THAT DEEP DOWN I WANT TO BE LOVED. If you want to be\nloved --\nlove! Because whatsoever you give is returned back. If you want to be loved forget about wanting to be loved, and in a thousand ways love will come to you. Life reflects, life resounds, life echoes whatsoever you throw at life. So if you want to be loved forget about wanting and being loved -- that is not the point at\nall then. Then simple is the rule\n-- love.\nAnd if you want to be accepted like the greatest man on earth, then start accepting everybody as the greatest man on earth. Otherwise how are they going to accept you as the greatest? They are also on the same trip. They are not going to accept you as the greatest because then what will happen to them? If you are the greatest, then who are they? Nobody wants to be anything else.\nOnce it happened, a friend of Mulla Nasruddin was talking to Mulla Nasruddin. They had met after many -- years. Both were bitter rivals; both were poets. Both started to boast about the progress they had made in their careers.\n'You have no idea, Nasruddin, how many people read my poetry now,' bragged the friend. 'My readers have doubled.'\n'My God, my God!' cried Nasruddin. 'I had no idea you got married!'\nEverybody is on the same trip. If you want people to accept you as the greatest man on earth, let this be the rule: whatsoever you want others to do for you, do for them. But that is the trouble. The ego wants you to be the greatest man on earth -- nobody else. Then you will feel hurt. Because all are on the same trip -- can't you understand the simple point? They are also waiting for you to accept them as the greatest man.\nI heard Mulla Nasruddin once. He was delivering a political speech.\nHe Said, 'It is with some trepidation that I address an audience of people all of whom are smarter than I am... all of them put together, that is.'\nEverybody is trying to be at the top of the world -- then you are in competition with the whole world. Remember, you are going to be defeated. One man fighting against the whole world -- that is the situation.\nIf you see the point, there are two ways. One, forget about this trip, be ordinary, simple, whatsoever you are. There is no need to be great, the only need is to be real. Great is the wrong goal. To be real.… I have come across a hip slogan: Be realistic -- plan for a miracle. Yes. that s how it is. If you ale really realistic, you start living the miracle. And the miracle is: if you are real, you don't want to be\nbothered with competition, comparison. Who bothers? You enjoy your food, you enjoy your breathing, you enjoy the sunlight, you enjoy the stars, you enjoy life, you enjoy being alive -- you are perfectly in tune. in harmony with the Whole. What is the point of being a great man? The great men, the so-called great men, are almost always phony -- they have to be. They cannot be real persons. They are plastic. Because they have chosen a wrong goal: to be great is an ego goal; to be real is existential.\nIf you want to be great you will be in continuous conflict. And of course you will be hurt by everybody. Not that everybody is trying to hurt you, they are doing their own trip.\nYou are unnecessarily coming in their way.\nGet out of this rat race. Sit under the tree by the side of the road; it is tremendously beautiful and silent. Otherwise be ready to be hurt.\nOne politician used to come to me. Once he was the president of the Indian National Congress -- a great man in India.\nAnd he told me, 'I am such a simple man. Why do people go on spreading nasty things about me? Why do people want to hurt me?'\nI told him, 'Nobody wants to hurt you. You are unnecessarily coming in their way. They also want to be president of great parties -- you are standing in their way. They have to push you away.' I told him, 'You just remember what you did to the president before you.\nThe same thing they are trying to do with you -- leg-pulling.'\nOnce you are in a power post you are continuously being pulled and pushed. It has to be so.\nRamakrishna used to tell a beautiful story.\nA bird was flying with a dead mouse and twenty or thirty birds were chasing him. The bird was very much worried.\n'I am not doing anything to them, I am just carrying my dead mouse. They are all after me.'\nAnd they hit him hard and in the conflict, in the struggle, the bird opened his mouth and the mouse dropped. Immediately they all flew towards the mouse; they all forgot about him.\nThen he sat upon a tree and brooded.\nThey were not against him, they were also on the same trip -- they wanted the mouse.\nIf people are hurting you, open your mouth. You must be carrying a dead mouse! Drop it!\nAnd then sit -- if you can, sit on the tree or under the tree and brood. And suddenly you will see that they have forgotten about you. They are not concerned. They never were concerned. The ego is a dead mouse.\nJones' oldest daughter had just given birth to a beautiful baby and Jones was being congratulated.\nHe looked downcast, however, and a friend said, 'What's the matter, Jones? Don't you like the idea of being a grandfather?'\nJones heaved an enormous sigh. 'No,' he said, 'I don't, but that doesn't bother me so much.\nIt is just that it is so humiliating to have to go to bed with a grandmother.'\nJust watch your mind -- how it creates problems. The woman remains the same but now she has become a grandmother -- and one feels humiliated.\nIt is your idea that is giving you humiliation. If you are really concerned with your own well-being then nobody is hurting you -- just your own ideas. Drop them.\nOr, two, it you feel good with them, don't be worried about the hurts. Carry them. But you have a decision inside. If you want the ego trip, if you want to be the greatest man in the world, then everybody is going to prove that you are the worst man in the world.\nThen have courage and heart to suffer all that. It is futile, but if you choose that\nway, it is your choice. If you really want your well-being and your inner calm and silence and bliss, then these hurts are indicative: you are carrying some wrong ideas within you.\nDrop those ideas. The last question:, Question 4\nI DON'T HAVE A QUESTION -- JUST A FEELING OF HOPELESSNESS. I CAN'T\nBELIEVE MY QUESTIONS, I HAVE A FEELING THEY COME FROM SOMETHING BRITTLE AND UNREAL.\nI DON'T HAVE A QUESTION -- JUST A FEELING OF HOPELESSNESS.\nHow does hopelessness arise? You must be hoping too much; it comes out of too much hope.\nIf you don't hope, all hopelessness disappears. If you expect too much, frustration is bound to come. if you are trying to succeed, you are bound to fail. Whatsoever you want to try too hard, just the opposite will happen.\nYou must have been trying too hard to fulfill some hope then hopelessness comes. If you really want to get rid of hopelessness -- and everybody wants that\n-- then get rid of hope. Drop all hope and suddenly you will see that with the hope, hopelessness has disappeared. Then one comes to an inner tranquillity where no hope exists -- and no hopelessness. One is simply calm and quiet and collected -- a deep reservoir of energy, a pool of energy, cool.\nBut for that you have to sacrifice hope. The question shows that you are still hoping.…\nGo a little more deeper and further: if you are really hopeless, hopelessness will disappear.\nLet me tell it to you another way. Whenever a person says that he is hopeless he simply says he is still clinging to the same hope which has proved to be futile, of\nwhich there is no indication of being fulfilled at all. One goes on holding it, hoping against all hope.\nThen hopelessness continues.\nDon't hope for anything. There is no need because all that you can hope for is already given. What more can you hope for?\nYou are here, everything is here -- just being is all. But you don't appreciate, you are asking for some dead mouse, some power trip, some ego trip, some success in the eyes of the world. Those are not going to be fulfilled, even Alexanders have failed. Even Alexander dies a poor man, a beggar, because everything that you accumulate is snatched back from you, you go empty-handed. Empty- handed you come; empty-handed you go.\nSo why bother about success, riches, power -- material or spiritual? Just be.… And being is the greatest miracle. Turn within yourself -- what Buddha calls PARABVRUTTI.\nTurn yourself a complete turn, a total turn, and suddenly you are so full of joy, you don't need anything. In fact you have so much that you would like to shower it on others.\nBut things go on moving from one extreme to another. You hope -- then by and by the pendulum moves towards hopelessness. If you are too much in love with life, by and by you move towards suicide. If you are too religious, by and by you move and become anti-religious. The pendulum goes on moving towards the opposite.\nSomewhere in the middle one has to stop. And if you stop in the middle, time stops with you. And when time stops, all hope, all desires have stopped. You start living. Now, now is the only time and here is the only space.\nLet me tell you one story. It is a very beautiful Jewish anecdote.\nYoung Sammy Moskowitz had just bought himself a motor scooter, but he had been brought up in orthodox fashion and wasn't the least bit sure whether it was fitting for an orthodox Jew to ride one. He thought that the best way out would be to get his reverend rabbi to teach him a barucha -- a traditional prayer of blessing -- to intone over the motor scooter before he drove it. Surely that would\nmake it proper for him to use it.\nHe therefore approached his rabbi and said, 'Rabbi, I have bought a motor scooter and I wish to know if you could teach me a barucha to say over it each morning.'\nThe rabbi said, 'What is a motor scooter?'\nSammy explained, and the rabbi shook his head. 'As far as I know, there is no appropriate barucha for the occasion and I strongly suspect that riding a motor scooter is a sin. I forbid you to use it.'\nSammy was very downhearted for from his very soul he longed to drive his motor scooter, which had set him back a considerable sum. A thought occurred to him. Why not seek a second and perhaps more liberal opinion -- from a rabbi who was not orthodox, but merely conservative?\nHe found a conservative rabbi, who, unlike the orthodox rabbi earlier consulted, was not in the traditional long coat at all but wore a dark business suit. The conservative rabbi said, What is a motor scooter?'\nSammy explained.\nThe rabbi thought for a while, then said, 'I suppose there's nothing wrong about riding a motor scooter, but still I don't know of any appropriate barucha and if your conscience hurts you without one, then don't drive it.'\nHe journeyed out to the suburbs and met Rabbi Richmond Ellis, in his knickerbockers, about to leave for the golf-links on his motor scooter.\nSammy grew terribly excited, 'It's all right for a Jew to ride a motor scooter?' he said. 'I've got one but I didn't know.'\n'Sure, kid,' said the rabbi. 'Nothing wrong with the motor scooter at all. Ride it in good health.'\n'Then give me a barucha for it.'\nThe reformed rabbi thought, then said, 'What's a barucha?'\nThe orthodox doesn't know what a motor scooter is and the progressive is not aware of what a barucha is.\nFrom religion, too much dogmatic religion, people become too irreligious. When they leave the church, they move to the prostitute.\nSomewhere a deep balance is needed. Just between the two, exactly between the two, is transcendence.\nSo, you have lived with hope -- now the hope has failed and you are living in hopelessness. Now, let hopelessness also fail; you drop hope and hopelessness together.\nYou just transcend that attitude which lives in the future. Live here now! Living in hope is living in the future, which is really postponing life. It is not a way of living, but a way of suicide. There is no need for any hope and there is no need to feel hopeless. Live here now. Life is tremendously blissful, it is showering here and you are looking somewhere else. It is just in front of your eyes, but your eyes have moved far away, they look at the horizon. It is within you, but you are not there.\nI am not for hope; I am not for hopelessness. I am against all extremism. All excess is futile.\nBuddha used to say, 'My path is the middle path.' That is the path of transcendence.\nAncient Music in the Pines Chapter #3\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"17262","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/ancient_music_in_the_pines/part1/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/ancient_music_in_the_pines/>Ancient Music in the Pines</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: A Zen Story</h1><div class=post-meta>82 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;17262 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Ancient_Music_in_the_Pines/part1.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=_index>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

mind, the dual mind.</p><p>It is just like a big tree, an ancient oak: the trunk is one, then
the tree divides into two main branches, the main bifurcation, from
which a thousand and one bifurcations of branches grow. The being is
just like the trunk of the tree -- one, non-dual -- and the mind is the
first bifurcation where the tree divides into two, becomes dual, becomes
dialectical: thesis and antithesis, man and woman, yin and yang, day and
night, God and Devil, yoga and Zen. All the dualities of the world are
basically in the duality of the mind -- and below the duality is oneness
of being. If you slip below, underneath the duality you will find one --
call it God, call it nirvana, or whatsoever you like.</p><p>If you go higher through the duality, you come to the many
million-fold world. This is one of the most basic insights to be
understood -- that mind is not one.</p><p>Hence, whatsoever you see through the mind becomes two. It is just
like a white ray entering a prism; it is immediately divided into seven
colors and the rainbow is created.</p><p>Before it entered the prism it was one, through the prism it is
divided. and the white color disappears into the seven colors of the
rainbow.</p><p>The world is a rainbow, the mind is a prism, and the being is the
white ray.</p><p>Modern research has come to a very significant fact, one of the most
significant achieved in this century, and that is that you don't have
one mind, you have two minds. Your brain is divided into two
hemispheres: the right hemisphere and the left hemisphere. The right
hemisphere is joined with the left hand, and the left hemisphere is
joined with the right hand -- crosswise. The right hemisphere is
intuitive, illogical, irrational, poetic, platonic, imaginative,
romantic, mythical,</p><p>religious; and the left hemisphere is logical, rational,
mathematical, Aristotelian, scientific, calculative. These two
hemispheres are constantly in conflict -- the basic politics of the
world is within you, the greatest politics of the world is within you.
You may not be aware of it, but once you become aware, the real thing to
be done is somewhere between these two minds.</p><p>The left hand is concerned with the right hemisphere -- intuition,
imagination, myth, poetry, religion -- and the left hand is very much
condemned. The society is of those who are right-handed -- right-handed
means left hemisphere. Ten per cent of children are born left-handed but
they are forced to be right-handed. Children who are born left-handed
are basically irrational, intuitive, non- mathematical, non-Euclidean...
they are dangerous for society so it forces them in every way to become
right-handed. It is not just a question of hands, it is a question of
inner politics: the left-handed child functions through the right
hemisphere -- that society cannot allow, it is dangerous, so he has to
be stopped before things go too far.</p><p>It is suspected that in the beginning the proportion must have been
fifty-fifty -- left-handed children fifty per cent and right-handed
children fifty per cent -- but the right-handed party has ruled so long
that by and by the proportion has fallen to ten per cent and ninety per
cent. Even amongst you here many will be left- handed but you may not be
aware of it. You may write with the right hand and do your work with the
right hand but in your childhood you may have been forced to be
right-handed. This is a trick because once you become right-handed your
left hemisphere starts functioning. The left hemisphere is reason; the
right hemisphere is beyond reason, its functioning is not mathematical.
It functions in flashes, it is intuitive, very graceful -- but
irrational.</p><p>The left-handed minority is the most oppressed minority in the world,
even more than Negroes, even more than the poor people. If you
understand this division, you will understand many things. With the
bourgeoisie and the proletariat the proletariat is always functioning
through the right hemisphere of the brain: the poor people are more
intuitive.</p><p>Go to the primitive people, they are more intuitive. The poorer the
person, the less intellectual -- and that may be the cause of his being
poor. Because he is less intellectual he cannot compete in the world of
reason. He is less articulate as far as language is concerned, reason is
concerned, calculation is concerned -- he is almost a fool. That may be
the cause of his being poor.</p><p>The rich person is functioning through the left hemisphere; he is
more calculative, arithmetical in everything, cunning, clever, logical
-- and he plans. That may be the reason why he is rich.</p><p>The bourgeoisie and the proletariat cannot disappear by communist
revolutions, no, because the communist revolution is by the same people.
The Czar ruled Russia; he ruled it through the left hemisphere of the
mind. Then he was replaced by Lenin who was of the same type. Then Lenin
was replaced by Stalin who was even more of the same type.</p><p>The revolution is false because deep down the same type of people are
ruling -- the ruler and the ruled mean the same, and the ruled are those
of the right-sided hemisphere. So whatsoever you do in the outside world
makes no difference really, it is superficial.</p><p>The same applies to men and women. Women are right-hemisphere people,
men are left-hemisphered. Men have ruled women for centuries. Now a few
women are revolting but the amazing thing is that these are the same
type of women. In fact they are just like men</p><p>-- rational, argumentative, Aristotelian. It is possible that one
day, just as the communist revolution has succeeded in Russia and China,
somewhere, maybe in America, women can succeed and overthrow men. But by
the time the women succeed, the women will no more be women, they will
have become left- hemisphered. Because to fight, one has to be
calculative, and to fight with men you have to be like men: aggressive.
That very aggressiveness is shown all over the world in women's
liberation. Women who have become part of that liberation movement are
very aggressive, they are losing all grace, all that comes out of
intuition. Because if you have to fight with men you have to learn the
same trick; if you have to fight with men, you have to fight with the
same techniques.</p><p>Fighting with anybody is very dangerous because you become like your
enemy. That is one of the greatest problems of humanity. Once you fight
with somebody, by and by you have to use the same technique and the same
way. Then the enemy may be defeated but by the time he is defeated you
have become your own enemy. Stalin is more Czar-like than any Czar, more
violent than any Czar. Of course it has to be so: to throw Czars, very
violent people are needed, more violent than the Czar himself. Only they
will become the revolutionaries, will come out on top. By the time they
reach there they have become Czars</p><p>themselves, and the society continues on the same way. Just
superficial things change, deep down the same conflict remains.</p><p>The conflict is in man. Unless it is resolved there, it cannot be
resolved anywhere else.</p><p>The politics is within you; it is between the two parts of the
mind.</p><p>A very small bridge exists. If that bridge is broken through some
accident, through some physiological defect or something else, the
person becomes split, the person becomes two persons -- and the
phenomenon of schizophrenia or split personality happens. If the bridge
is broken -- and the bridge is very fragile -- then you become two, you
behave like two persons. In the morning you are very loving, very
beautiful; in the evening you are very angry, absolutely different. You
don't remember your morning... how can you remember? Another mind was
functioning -- and the person becomes two persons. If this bridge is
strengthened so much that the two minds disappear as two and become one,
then integration, then crystallization, arises. What George Gurdjieff
used to call the crystallization of being is nothing but these two minds
becoming one, the meeting of the male and the female within, the meeting
of yin and yang, the meeting of the left and right, the meeting of logic
and illogic, the meeting of Plato and Aristotle.</p><p>If you can understand this basic bifurcation in your tree of then you
can understand all the conflict that goes on around and inside you.</p><p>Let me tell you an anecdote.</p><p>Among the Germans, Berlin is considered to be the very epitome of
Prussian brusqueness and efficiency, while Vienna is the essence of
Austrian charm and slipshoddery.</p><p>There is the tale of a Berliner visiting Vienna who was lost and in
need of directions.</p><p>What would such a Berliner do? He grabbed at the lapel of the first
passing Viennese and barked out, 'The Post Office. Where is it?'</p><p>The startled Viennese carefully detached the other's fist, smoothed
his lapel and said in a gentle manner,</p><p>'Sir, would it not have been more delicate of you to have approached
me politely and to have said. "Sir, if you have a moment and happen to
know, could you direct me to the Post Office?"'</p><p>The Berliner stared in astonishment for a moment, then growled, 'I
would rather be lost!'</p><p>and stomped away.</p><p>That very same Viennese was visiting Berlin too that year and it
turned out that now it was he who had to search for the Post Office.
Approaching a Berliner he said politely,</p><p>'Sir, if you have a moment and happen to know, could you please
direct me to the Post Office?'</p><p>With machine-like rapidity the Berliner replied,</p><p>'About face, two blocks forward, sharp turn right, one block forward,
cross a street, half turn on the right, walk left over railroad tracks,
pass news-stand into Post Office lobby.'</p><p>The Viennese, more bewildered than enlightened, nevertheless
murmured, 'A thousand thanks, kind sir,' whereupon the Berliner snatched
furiously at the other's lapel and shouted, 'Never mind the thanks,
repeat the instructions!'</p><p>The male mind, the Berliner; the female mind, the Viennese. The
female mind has a grace, the male mind has efficiency. and of course, in
the long run, if there is a constant fight, the grace is bound to be
defeated -- the efficient mind will win. because the world understands
the language of mathematics not of love. But the moment your efficiency
wins over your grace, you have lost something tremendously valuable: you
have lost contact with your own being. You may become very efficient,
but you will be no more a real person. You will become a machine, a
robot-like thing.</p><p>Because of this here is constant conflict between man and woman. They
cannot remain separate, they have to get into relationship again and
again -- but they cannot remain together either. The fight is not
outside, the fight is within you. And this is my understanding: unless
you have resolved your inner fight between the right and the left
hemispheres, you will never be able to be peacefully in love</p><p>-- never -- because the inner fight will be reflected outside. If you
are fighting inside and you are identified with the left hemisphere, the
reason hemisphere, and you are continuously trying to overpower the
right hemisphere, you will try to do the same with the woman you fall in
love with. If the woman is continuously fighting her own reason inside,
she will continuously fight the man she loves.</p><p>All relationships -- almost all, the exceptions are negligible, can
be left out of account --</p><p>are ugly. In the beginning they are beautiful; in the beginning you
don't show the reality; in the beginning you pretend. Once the
relationship settles and you relax, your inner conflict bubbles up and
starts being mirrored in your relationship. Then come fights, then come
a thousand and one ways of nagging each other, destroying each other.
Hence the attraction for homosexuality. Whenever a society becomes too
divided between man and woman, homosexuality erupts immediately. Because
at least a man in love with a man is not that much in conflict. The love
relationship may not be very satisfying, may not lead to tremendous
bliss and orgasmic moments, but at least it is not so ugly as the
relationship between a man and a woman. Women become lesbians whenever
the conflict becomes too much, because at least the love relationship
between two women is not so deep in conflict. The same meets the same;
they can understand each other.</p><p>Yes, understanding is possible, but the attraction is lost, the
polarity is lost -- it is at a very great cost. Understanding is
possible, but the whole tension, the challenge, is lost. If you choose
challenge, then comes conflict, because the real problem is somewhere
within you. Unless you have settled, come to a deep harmony between your
female and male mind, you will not be able to love.</p><p>People come to me and they ask how to go deep in a relationship, I
tell them, 'First you go deep in meditation. Unless you are resolved
within yourself you will create more problems than you already have. If
you move in relationship, all your problems will be multiplied. Just
watch. The greatest and the most beautiful thing in the world is love
but can you find anything more ugly, more hell- creating?'</p><p>Mulla Nasruddin once told me, 'Well, I have been putting off the evil
day for months but I have got to go this time.'</p><p>'Dentist or doctor?' I inquired.</p><p>'Neither,' he said, 'I am getting married.'</p><p>People go on avoiding marriage, people go on putting it off. When
some day they find it impossible to get out of it only then they relax.
Where is the problem? Why are people so afraid of getting deeply
involved? Involvement immediately creates fear; commitment immediately
creates fear -- and the modern man wants to have sex but no love.</p><p>A woman told me that she wants sex only with strangers. Traveling in
a train, meeting with a stranger -- that's okay -- but not even with
someone who is friendly or familiar. I asked, 'Why?' She said that once
you make love to someone who is known to you, some involvement starts.
In a train, on a journey, you meet, make love, you don't know even what
the other person's name is, who he is, from where he comes. You get down
when your station comes and he moves away, forgotten forever; he leaves
no scratch, you remain completely clean. You come out of it completely
clean and unscratched.</p><p>I can understand. This is the difficulty of the whole modern mind.
All relationships are becoming by and by casual. People are afraid of
any sort of commitment,, because they have come to know at least one
thing out of bitter experience -- whenever you become related too much,
the reality erupts, and your inner conflict starts being reflected by
the other and then life becomes ugly, horrible, intolerable.</p><p>It happened once that I was sitting with a few friends in a
university campus ground. One of the professors said, 'On the day my
wedding occurred '</p><p>But the other professor stopped him immediately and said 'Pardon the
correction, but affairs such as marriages, receptions, dinners, and
things of that nature, take place. It is only calamities which occur.
You see the distinction? Please don't say, "The day my marriage
occurred, or the day my wedding occurred."'</p><p>The other was a professor of language and of course he was right. But
the first man said,</p><p>'Yes, many, many things...' and again started, 'And as I was saying,
the day my wedding occurred It is a calamity.'</p><p>If you are outside of it, it may look like a beautiful oasis in the
desert but as you come close the oasis starts drying and disappearing.
Once you are caught in it, it is an imprisonment, but remember, the
imprisonment doesn't come from the other, it comes from within you.</p><p>If the left-hemisphere brain goes on dominating you, you will live a
very successful life --</p><p>so successful that by the time you are forty you will have ulcers; by
the time you are forty-five you will have had at least one or two
heart-attacks; by the time you are fifty you will be almost dead -- but
successfully dead. You may become a great scientist, but you will never
become a great being. You may accumulate enough of wealth, but you will
lose all that is of worth. You may conquer the whole world like an
Alexander, but your own inner territory will remain unconquered.</p><p>There are many attractions to follow the left-hemisphere brain --
that is the worldly brain.</p><p>It is more concerned with things: cars, money, houses, power,
prestige. That is the orientation of the man who in India we call a
GRUSTHA, a householder.</p><p>The right-hemisphere brain is the orientation of the SANNYASIN. one
who is more interested in his own inner being, his inner peace, his
blissfulness, and is less concerned about things. If they come easily,
good; if they don't come that is also good. He is more concerned with
the moment, less concerned with the future; more concerned with the
poetry of life, less concerned with the arithmetic of it.</p><p>I have heard an anecdote.</p><p>Finkelstein had made a huge killing at the races and Muscovitz, quite
understandably, was envious.</p><p>'How did you do it, Finkelstein?' he demanded. 'Easy,' said
Finkelstein, 'it was a dream.'</p><p>'A dream?'</p><p>'Yes; I had figured out a three-horse parley, but I was not sure
about the third horse. Then the night before, I dreamed that an angel
was standing over the head of my bed and kept saying, 'Blessings on you,
Finkelstein, seven times seven blessings on you.' When I woke up I
realized that seven times seven is forty- eight and that horse number
seventy-eight was Heavenly Dream. I made Heavenly Dream the third horse
in my parley and I just cleaned up, simply cleaned up.'</p><p>Muscovitz said, 'But Finkelstein, seven times seven is forty-nine!'
And Finkelstein said, 'So you be the mathematician.'</p><p>There is a way to follow life through arithmetic and there is another
way to follow life through dream -- through dreams and visions. They are
totally different.</p><p>Just the other day somebody asked, 'Are there ghosts, fairies, and
things like that?' Yes, there are -- if you move through the
right-hemisphere brain, there are. If you move through the
left-hemisphere brain, there are not. All children are
right-hemisphered, they see ghosts and fairies all around, but you go on
talking to them and putting them in their places and saying to them,
'Nonsense. You are stupid. Where is the fairy? There is nothing, just a
shadow.' By and by you convince the child, the helpless child; by and by
you convince him and he moves from the right-hemisphered orientation to
the left-hemisphered orientation -- he has to. He has to live in your
world: he has to forget his dreams, he has to forget all myth, he has to
forget all poetry, he has to learn mathematics.</p><p>Of course he becomes efficient in mathematics -- and becomes almost
crippled and paralyzed in life. Existence goes on getting farther and
farther away and he becomes just a commodity in the market, his whole
life becomes just rubbish... although, of course, valuable in the eyes
of the world.</p><p>A SANNYASIN is one who lives through the imagination, who lives
through the dreaming quality of his mind, who lives through poetry, who
poeticizes about life, who looks through visions. Then trees are greener
than they look to you, then birds are more beautiful, then everything
takes a luminous quality. Ordinary pebbles become diamonds; ordinary
rocks are no longer ordinary -- nothing is ordinary. If you look from
the right hemisphere, everything becomes Divine, sacred. Religion is
from the right hemisphere.</p><p>A man was sitting with his friend in a cafeteria drinking tea. He
studied his cup and said with a sigh, 'Ah, my friend, life is like a cup
of tea.'</p><p>The other considered that for a moment and then said, 'But why? Why
is life like a cup of tea?'</p><p>The first man replied, 'How should I know? Am I a philosopher?'</p><p>The right-hemisphere brain only makes statements about facts, it
cannot give you reasons. If you ask, 'Why?' it can only remain silent,
there comes no response from it. If you are walking and you see a lotus
flower and you say, 'Beautiful!' -- and somebody says, 'Why?' what will
you do? You will say, 'How am I to know? Am I a philosopher?' It is a
simple statement, a very simple statement, in itself total, complete.
There is no reason behind it and no result beyond it, it is a simple
statement of fact. Read the Upanishads --</p><p>they are simple statements of facts. They say, 'God is. Don't ask
why.' They will say, 'Are we philosophers? How are we to know? God is.'
They say God is beautiful, they say God is near, closer than your heart,
but don't ask why -- they are not philosophers.</p><p>Look at the gospels and the statements of Jesus -- they are simple.
He says, 'My God is in heaven. I am his son, he is my father. Don't ask
why.' He will not be able to prove it in a court, he will simply say, 'I
know.' If you ask him by whom he has been told, by what authority he
says these things, he will say, 'It is by my own authority. I have no
other authority.' That is the problem when a man like Jesus moves in the
world. The rational mind cannot understand, he was not crucified for any
other reason. He was crucified by the left hemisphere because he was a
right-hemisphere man. He was crucified because of the inner
conflict.</p><p>Lao Tzu says, 'The whole world seems to be clever, only I am
muddle-headed; the whole world seems to be certain, only I am confused
and hesitant.' He is a right-hemisphered man.</p><p>The right hemisphere is the hemisphere of poetry and love. A great
shift is needed; that shift is the inner transformation. Yoga is an
effort to reach the oneness of being through the left hemisphere, using
logic, mathematics, science and trying to go beyond. Zen is just the
opposite: the aim is the same but Zen uses the right hemisphere to go
beyond.</p><p>Both can be used, but to follow yoga is a very, very long path; it is
almost an unnecessary struggle because you are trying to reach from
reason to super-reason which is more difficult. Zen is easier because it
is an effort to reach the super- reason from irreason.</p><p>Irreason is almost like super-reason -- there are no barriers. Yoga
is like penetrating a wall and Zen is like opening a door. The door may
not be closed at all, you just push it a little and it opens.</p><p>Now the story. It is one of the most beautiful among Zen anecdotes.
Zen people talk through stories. They have to talk through stories
because they cannot create theories and doctrines, they can only tell
stories. They are great story-tellers. Jesus goes on talking in
parables, Buddha goes on talking in parables, Sufi mystics go on talking
in parables -- it is not coincidental. The story, the parable, the
anecdote, is the way of the right hemisphere; logic argument, proof,
syllogism, is the way of the left hemisphere.</p><p>Listen to it.</p><p>GOSO HOYEN USED TO SAY, 'WHEN PEOPLE ASK ME WHAT ZEN IS LIKE, I TELL
THEM THIS STORY.'</p><p>This story really tells what Zen is like -- without defining, it
indicates. A definition is not possible because Zen in its basic quality
is indefinable. You can taste it but you cannot define it; you can live
it but language is not sufficient to say it; you can show it but you
cannot say it. But through a story a little bit can be transferred. And
this story really indicates, indicates perfectly the quality of what Zen
is like. This is just a gesture, don't make it a definition, don't
philosophize around it, let it be like lightning, a flash of
understanding. It is not going to increase your knowledge but it can
give you a shift, a jerk, a change of gestalt. You can be thrown from
one corner of the mind to another...and that is the whole point of the
story.</p><p>NOTICING THAT HIS FATHER WAS GROWING OLD,</p><p>THE SON OF A BURGLAR ASKED HIS FATHER TO TEACH HIM THE TRADE</p><p>SO THAT HE COULD CARRY ON THE FAMILY BUSINESS</p><p>AFTER HIS FATHER HAD RETIRED.</p><p>The trade of a burglar is not a scientific thing: it is an art.
Burglars are as much born as poets; you cannot learn, learning won't
help. If you learn, you will be caught because then the police know more
than you. They have accumulated centuries of learning. A burglar is a
born burglar; he lives through intuition, it is a knack; he lives
through hunches. A burglar is feminine, he is not a businessman; he is a
gambler, he risks all for almost nothing; his whole trade is of danger
and risk. It is just like a religious man. Zen people say that religious
people are also like burglars: in search of God they are also
burglars.</p><p>There is no way to reach God through logic or reason or accepted
society, culture, civilization. They break the wall somewhere, they
enter from the back door If in the daylight it is not allowed, they
enter in dark. If it is not possible to follow the crowd on the
super-highway, they make their own individual paths in the forest. Yes,
there is a certain similarity. You can reach God only if you are a
burglar, an artist of how to steal the fire, how to steal the
treasure.</p><p>The father was going to retire and the son asked, 'Before you retire
teach me your trade.'</p><p>THE FATHER AGREED, AND THAT NIGHT THEY BROKE INTO A HOUSE</p><p>TOGETHER.</p><p>OPENING A LARGE CHEST THE FATHER TOLD THE SON TO GO IN AND PICK</p><p>OUT THE CLOTHING. AS SOON AS THE BOY WAS INSIDE, THE FATHER</p><p>LOCKED THE CHEST AND THEN MADE A LOT OF NOISE SO THAT THE WHOLE HOUSE
WAS AROUSED. THEN HE SLIPPED QUIETLY AWAY.</p><p>A real master he must have been, no ordinary burglar...</p><p>LOCKED INSIDE THE CHEST THE BOY WAS ANGRY, TERRIFIED, AND</p><p>PUZZLED...</p><p>of course, naturally, what type of teaching is this? He had been
thrown in a dangerous situation.</p><p>But that is the only way to teach something of the unknown; that is
the only way to teach something of the right-hemisphere brain. The left
hemisphere can be taught in schools: learning is possible, discipline is
possible, gradual courses are possible. Then by and by, moving from one
class to another, you become masters of art and science -- many
things.</p><p>But there cannot be any schools for the right hemisphere: it is
intuitive, it is not gradual, it is sudden. It is like a flash, a
lightning in the dark night. If it happens, it happens; if it doesn't
happen, it doesn't happen -- nothing can be done about it. You can only
leave yourself in a certain situation where there is more possibility
for it to happen. That's why I say the old man must have been a real
master.</p><p>LOCKED INSIDE THE CHEST, THE BOY WAS ANGRY, TERRIFIED, AND</p><p>-- PUZZLED...</p><p>These are the three states your reason will pass through. In all my
meditations the same is being done to you. Locked in a chest, with the
key thrown away, first you feel angry.</p><p>Many SANNYASINS come to me and they say they feel very angry with me.
I can understand, it is natural -- I am forcing them into situations
where their old mind cannot function. That is the root cause of anger.
They simply feel impotent, their old mind cannot function, they cannot
make anything out of it. What is happening? And when you feel a
situation where your mind is simply useless, you feel angry towards me
-- angry and then terrified. Then one understands the whole situation
and all that you have learned seems absolutely useless...hence fear.</p><p>Now there was no logical way to get out of that chest: it was locked
from the outside, the father had made a noise, the whole house was
awake, people were moving around, searching, and the father had escaped.
Now is there any logical way to get out of this chest? Logic simply
fails, reason is of no use. What can you think? Mind suddenly stops
-</p><p>- and that is what the father is doing, that is what it is all about.
He is trying to force the son into a situation where the logical mind
stops, because a burglar does not need a logical mind. If he follows a
logical mind he will be caught sooner or later by the police because
they also follow the same logic.</p><p>It happened in the second world war. For three years Adolph Hitler
continued to win, and the reason was that he was illogical.. All the
other countries that were fighting with him were fighting logically. Of
course, they had a great science of war, military training and this and
that, and they had experts who would say, 'Now, Hitler is going to
attack from this side.' And if Hitler was also in his senses he would
have done that because that was the weakest point in the enemy's
defense. Of course the enemy has to be attacked where he is the weakest
-- it is logical. So they would be expecting Hitler at the weakest
point, they would be gathering around the weakest point and he would hit
anywhere, unpredictably. He would not even follow his own generals'
advice.</p><p>He had an astrologer who would suggest where to attack. Now this is
something never done before -- a war is not run by astrologers. Once
Churchill understood, once the spies came with the report that they were
not going to win with this man because he was absolutely illogical; that
a foolish astrologer who didn't know anything about war, who had never
been on the front, was deciding things, deciding by the stars -- what
have stars got to do with a war going on on the earth? -- then Churchill
immediately appointed a royal astrologer to the king and they started
following the royal astrologer. Then things started falling in line
because now two fools were predicting Things became easier.</p><p>If a burglar is going to follow Aristotle he will be caught sooner or
later because the same Aristotelian logic is followed by the police.
Just few days before, Vedanta did a beautiful thing: he escaped with the
ashram jeep. Of course the police had to be informed.</p><p>Everybody was expecting that he would go towards Chanda, because he
had been saying that he wanted to go to Chanda and re-open an old ashram
which used to be there --</p><p>Kailash. Had he gone towards there the police may not have follow,
but the police were thinking logically and they said, 'If he had been
saying that he was going towards Chanda he will not go to Chanda now
because he will be afraid he will be caught on that road. He is not
going there.' So they were not worried</p><p>about that road and, of course, Vedanta was caught in Lonavalla. He
was going towards Bombay. But the police also followed the same
logic.</p><p>If you go through logic, then anybody who follows the logical method
can catch you anywhere.</p><p>A burglar has to be unpredictable, logic is not possible. He has to
be illogical -- so much so that nobody can predict him. But illogic is
possible only if your whole energy moves through the right
hemisphere.</p><p>LOCKED INSIDE THE CHEST, THE BOY WAS ANGRY, TERRIFIED, AND PUZZLED AS
TO HOW HE WAS GOING TO GET OUT.</p><p>'How?' is a logical question. Hence he was terrified because there
was no way -- 'How?'</p><p>was simply impotent. Then an idea flashed to him. Now this is a
shift: only in dangerous situations where the left hemisphere cannot
function, does it, as a last resort. allow the right hemisphere to have
its say. When it cannot function, when it feels that now there is no go,
now it is defeated, then it says why not give a chance to the oppressed,
to the imprisoned part of the mind? Give that too a chance.
Maybe...there can be no harm.</p><p>THEN AN IDEA FLASHED ON HIM -- HE MADE A NOISE LIKE A CAT.</p><p>Now this is not logical. Making a noise like a cat? Simply an absurd
idea. But it worked.</p><p>THE FAMILY TOLD A MAID TO TAKE A CANDLE AND EXAMINE THE CHEST.</p><p>WHEN THE LID WAS UNLOCKED THE BOY JUMPED OUT, BLEW OUT THE</p><p>CANDLE, PUSHED HIS WAY PAST THE ASTONISHED MAID, AND RAN OUT.</p><p>THE PEOPLE RAN AFTER HIM.</p><p>NOTICING A WELL BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD THE BOY THREW IN A LARGE
STONE, THEN HID IN THE DARKNESS. THE PURSUERS GATHERED</p><p>AROUND THE WELL TRYING TO SEE THE BURGLAR DROWNING HIMSELF.</p><p>This too is not of the logical mind. Because the logical mind needs
time -- the logical mind needs time to proceed, to think, to argue this
way and that, all the alternatives -- and there are a thousand and one
alternatives. When you are in a situation there is no time to think. If
people are pursuing you -- how can you think? Thinking is good when you
are sitting in an armchair. With your closed eyes you can philosophize
and think and argue, for this and against that, pro and con; but when
people are pursuing you and your life is in danger you have no time to
think -- one lives in the moment, one simply becomes spontaneous. It is
not that he decided to throw the stone, it simply happened. It was not a
conclusion, he was not thinking about doing it, he simply found himself
doing it. He threw a stone in the well and hid himself in the darkness,
and the pursuers stopped, thinking the burglar had drowned himself in
the well.</p><p>WHEN THE BOY GOT HOME HE WAS VERY ANGRY AT HIS FATHER AND HE</p><p>TRIED TO TELL HIM THE STORY; BUT THE FATHER SAID: 'DON'T BOTHER</p><p>TO TELL ME THE DETAILS, YOU ARE HERE YOU HAVE LEARNED THE ART.'</p><p>What is the point of telling the details? They are useless. Details
are useless as far as intuition is concerned because intuition is never
a repetition. Details are meaningful as far as logic is concerned. So,
logical people go on into minute details so that if the same situation
happens again they will be in control and they will know what to do.</p><p>But in the life of a burglar the same situation never happens again.
And in real life also the same situation never happens again. If you
have conclusions in your mind you will become almost dead, you will not
be responding. In life, response is needed, not reaction: you have to
act out of nowhere, with no conclusions inside. With no center you have
to act -- you have to act into the unknown from</p><p>the unknown.</p><p>And this is what Goso Hoyen used to say when people asked him what
Zen is like. This story he would tell.</p><p>Zen is exactly like burglary: it is an art, it is not a science; it
is feminine, it is not male; it is not aggressive, it is receptive; it
is not a well-planned methodology; it is a spontaneity.</p><p>It has nothing to do with theories, hypotheses, doctrines,
scriptures; it has something to do with only one thing -- that is,
awareness.</p><p>What happened in that moment when the boy was inside the chest? In
such a danger you cannot be sleepy, in such a danger your consciousness
becomes very sharp, has to. Life is at stake, you are totally awake --
that's how one should be totally awake each moment.</p><p>And when you are totally awake, this shift happens: from the left
hemisphere the energy moves to the right hemisphere. Whenever you are
alert, you become intuitive; flashes come to you, flashes from the
unknown, out of the blue. You may not follow them -- then you will miss
much.</p><p>In fact all the great discoveries in science come from the right
hemisphere also, not from the left. You must have heard about Madam
Curie, the only woman who got a Nobel Prize. She had been working hard
for three years on a certain mathematical problem but could not solve
it. She worked hard. argued from this way and that, but there was no
way.</p><p>One night. tired. exhausted. she fell asleep -- and while she was
falling asleep then too she was trying to solve the problem. In the
night she awoke. walked, wrote the answer on some paper. came back. and
went to sleep. In the morning she found the answer there on the table
but she could not believe who had done it. Nobody could do it! The
servant --</p><p>you could not expect him to do it; he did not know anything about
mathematics. She remembered well that last night she had tried her best
and could not do it. What had happened? Then she tried to remember --
because the handwriting was hers. She tried to remember...and then a
faint remembrance came: as if in a dream she had walked to the table and
written.</p><p>From where had this answer come? It could not be from the left
hemisphere. the left had been working hard for three years. And there
was no process on the paper, just the conclusion. If it had come from
the left there would have been a process, it goes step by step. But this
was like a flash -- the same kind of flash that had happened to the boy
in the chest. The left hemisphere, tired, exhausted, helpless, sought
the help of the right hemisphere.</p><p>Whenever you are in such a corner that your logic fails, don't be
desperate, don't become hopeless. Those moments may prove the greatest
blessings in your life: those are the moments that the left allows the
right to have its way. Then the feminine part, the receptive part. gives
you an idea. If you follow it. many doors will be opened. But it is
possible you may miss it; you may say. 'What nonsense!'</p><p>This boy could have missed. The idea is not very normal, regular,
logical. Make a noise like a cat? For what? He could have asked, 'Why?
and then he would have missed. But he could not ask because the
situation was such that there was no other way. So he thought,</p><p>'Let us try. What is wrong in it?' He used the clue.</p><p>The father was right. He said, 'Don't go into details. they are not
important. You are back home, you have learned the art.'</p><p>The whole art is how to function from the feminine part of the mind.
because the feminine is joined with the Whole and the male is not joined
with the Whole. The male is aggressive, the male is constantly in
struggle -- the feminine is constantly in surrender, in deep trust.
Hence the feminine body is so beautiful, so round. There is a deep trust
and a deep harmony with nature. A woman lives in deep surrender -- a man
is constantly fighting, angry, doing this and that, trying to prove
something, trying to reach somewhere. A woman is happy, not trying to
reach anywhere. Ask women if they would like to go to the moon. They
will simply be amazed. For what? What is the point? Why take such
trouble? The home is perfectly good. The woman is not interested in what
is happening in Vietnam and what is happening in Korea and what is
happening in Israel She is at the most interested in what is happening
in the neighborhood, at the most interested in who has fallen in love
with whom, who has escaped with whom... in gossips not in politics. She
is more interested in the immediate, here now, and that gives her a
harmony, a grace. Man is constantly trying to prove something. and if
you want to prove of course you have to fight and compete and</p><p>accumulate.</p><p>Once a woman tried to get Dr. Johnson to talk with her but he seemed
to take very little notice of her.</p><p>'Why, Doctor,' she said archly, 'I believe you prefer the company of
men to that of women.'</p><p>'Madam,' replied Johnson, 'I am very fond of the company of ladies. I
like their beauty, I like their delicacy, I like their vivacity, and I
like their silence.'</p><p>Man has been forcing woman to be silent, not only outside, inside
also -- forcing the feminine part to keep quiet. Just watch within you.
If the feminine part says something you immediately jump upon it and you
say, 'Logical? Absurd!' People come to me and they say. 'The heart says
we would like to become SANNYASINS but the head says no...'</p><p>Dr. Johnson, trying to keep the woman silent. The heart is
feminine.</p><p>You miss much in your life because the head goes on talking; it does
not allow. And the only quality in the head is that it is more
articulate, cunning, dangerous, violent. Because of its violence it has
become the leader inside, and that inside leadership has become an
outside leadership for man. Man has dominated women in the outside world
also; the grace is dominated by violence.</p><p>I was invited to a school for a certain function. There was a rally
of school- children and in the rally the procession had been arranged
according to height -- from the shortest up to the tallest. But the
pattern was broken, I noticed, by the first boy heading the procession.
He was a gangling youth who looked a head taller than the rest. 'Why is
he at the front?'</p><p>I asked a young girl, 'Is he the leader of the school, the captain,
or something like that?'</p><p>'No,' she whispered, 'he pinches.'</p><p>The male mind goes on pinching, creating trouble. Trouble-makers
become leaders. In the schools, all wise teachers choose the greatest
trouble-makers as captains of the classes and the schools -- the
trouble-makers. the criminals. Once they are in a powerful post their
whole energy for trouble-making becomes</p><p>helpful for the teacher. They start creating discipline -- the same
ones.</p><p>Just watch the politicians in the world: when one party is in power
the opposite party goes on creating trouble in the country. They are the
law-breakers, the revolutionaries.</p><p>And the party which is in power goes on creating discipline. Once
they are thrown out of power, they will create trouble. and once the
opposite party comes into power they become the guardians of
discipline.</p><p>They are all trouble-makers.</p><p>The male mind is a trouble-making phenomenon -- hence it overpowers.
it dominates.</p><p>But deep down. although you may attain power, you miss life -- and
deep down, the feminine mind continues. Unless you fall back to the
feminine and you surrender. unless your resistance and struggle become
surrender. you will not know what real life, and the celebration of it,
is.</p><p>I have heard one anecdote.</p><p>An American scientist once visited the offices of the great Nobel
prize-winning physicist, Niels Bohr, in Copenhagen, and was amazed to
find that over his desk was a horseshoe, securely nailed to the wall
with the open end up in the approved manner so it would catch the good
luck and not let it spill out.</p><p>The American said with a nervous laugh, 'Surely you don't believe the
horseshoe will bring you good luck, do you, Professor Bohr? After all,
as a level-headed scientist '</p><p>Bohr chuckled, 'I believe in no such thing, my good friend, not at
all. I am scarcely likely to believe in such foolish nonsense. However,
I am told that a horseshoe will bring you good luck whether you believe
in it or not.'</p><p>Look a little deeper, and just underneath your logic you will find
fresh waters of intuition, fresh waters of trust, flowing.</p><p>Yoga is a way to use reason to reach God -- of course very difficult,
and the longest path.</p><p>If you follow Patanjali you are trying to do that which can happen
without doing; you are trying hard to do something. You are trying to
pull yourself by shoe- strings -- to pull yourself up.</p><p>Zen is the way of the spontaneous -- the effortless effort, the way
of intuition.</p><p>A Zen Master, Ikkyu, a great poet, has said: I can see clouds a
thousand miles away, hear ancient music in the pines.</p><p>This is what Zen is all about. You cannot see clouds a thousand miles
away with the logical mind. The logical mind is like glass, too dirty,
too covered with the dust of ideas, theories, doctrines. But you can see
clouds a thousand miles away with the pure glass of intuition, with no
thoughts -- just pure awareness. The mirror is clean and the clarity
supreme.</p><p>You cannot hear ancient music in the pines with the ordinary logical
mind. How can you hear the ancient music? Music once gone is gone
forever.</p><p>But I tell you, Ikkyu is right. You can hear ancient music in the
pines -- I have heard it --</p><p>but a shift, a total change, a change of gestalt, is needed. Then you
can see Buddha preaching again and you can hear Buddha speaking again.
You can hear the ancient music in the pines because it is eternal music,
it is never lost. You have lost the capacity to hear it. The music is
eternal; once you regain your capacity, suddenly it is there again.</p><p>It has always been there, only you were not there. Be here now and
you can also see clouds a thousand miles away, and hear ancient music in
the pines.</p><p>Change more and more towards the right hemisphere, become more and
more feminine, more and more loving, surrendering, trusting, more and
more closer to the Whole. Don't try to be an island -- become part of
the continent.</p><p>Ancient Music in the Pines Chapter #2</p><p>Chapter title: A thousand and one bifurcations</p><p>22 February 1976 am in Buddha Hall Archive</p><p>code:</p><p>7602220</p><p>ShortTitle:</p><p>ANCIEN02</p><p>Audio:</p><p>Yes Video: No Length:</p><p>101</p><p>mins</p><p>The first question:</p><p>Question 1</p><p>YOU TOLD ME THAT MY MIND IS IMMATURE. WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO</p><p>HAVE A MIND THAT IS MATURE?</p><p>To think that you know is to be immature. To function from knowledge,
from conclusion, is to be immature. To function from no-knowledge, from
no conclusion, from no past, is maturity.</p><p>Maturity is deep trust in your own consciousness; immaturity is a
distrust in your own consciousness. When you distrust your consciousness
you trust your knowledge, but that is a substitute and a very poor
substitute at that. Try to understand this -- it is important.</p><p>You have been living, you have experienced many things; you have
read, you have listened, you have thought. Now all those conclusions are
there. When a certain situation arises. you can function in two ways.
You can function through all the accumulated past, according to it --
that's what I mean by functioning through a center. through conclusions,
through experience, stale, dead -- then whatsoever you do your response
is not going to be a response, it will be a reaction. And to be
reactionary is to be immature.</p><p>Or, if you can function right now, here in this moment, through your
consciousness, through your being aware, putting aside all that you have
known</p><p>-- this is what I call functioning through no-knowledge, this is
functioning through innocence. And this is maturity.</p><p>I was reading one anecdote.</p><p>It seemed to Mr. Smith that now that his son had turned thirteen, it
was important to discuss those matters which an adolescent ought to know
about life. So he called the boy into the study one evening. shut the
door carefully, and said with impressive dignity.</p><p>'Son, I would like to discuss the facts of life with you.'</p><p>'Sure thing, Dad.' said the boy. 'What do you want to know?'</p><p>The mind is immature when it is not ready to learn. The ego feels
very fulfilled if it need not learn anything from anybody; the ego feels
very enhanced if it feels that it already knows. But the problem is that
life goes on changing, it is never the same; it goes on flowing, it is a
flux. And your knowledge is always the same. Your knowledge is not
evolving with life, it is stuck somewhere in the past, and whenever you
react through it you will miss the point because it will not be exactly
the right thing to do. Life has changed but your knowledge remains the
same. and you act out of this knowledge. That means you face today with
your yesterday's knowledge. You will never be able to be alive. The more
you function through knowledge, the more immature you become.</p><p>Now let me tell you a paradox: every child who is innocent is
mature.</p><p>Maturity has nothing to do with age because it has nothing to do with
experience; maturity has something to do with responsiveness, freshness,
virginity, innocence. So when I use the word 'mature' I don't mean that
when you</p><p>become more experienced you will be more mature. That's what people
usually mean when they use the word -- I don't mean that. The more you
gather knowledge, the more your mind will become immature; and by the
time you are seventy or eighty, you will be completely immature because
you will have a stale past to function through. Watch a small
child...knowing nothing, having no experience, he functions here and
now.</p><p>That's why children can learn more than aged people. Psychologists
say that if a child is not forced to learn, not forced to discipline
himself, he can learn any foreign language in three months. Just left to
himself with people who know the language he will catch it in three
months. But if you force him to learn, it will take almost three years,
because the more you force, the more he starts functioning through
whatsoever he learns, through yesterday's knowledge. If he is left to
himself he moves freely, spontaneously; learning comes easy, by itself,
on its own accord.</p><p>By the time the child reaches the year eight he has learned almost
seventy per cent of whatsoever he is going to learn in his whole life.
He may live eighty years, but by the time he is eight he has learned
seventy per cent -- he will learn only thirty per cent more, and every
day his capacity to learn will be less and less and less. The more he
knows, the less he learns. When people use the word 'maturity' they mean
more knowledge; when I use the word 'maturity' I mean the capacity to
learn. Not to know but to learn -- and they are different, totally
different, diametrically opposite things. Knowledge is a dead thing; the
capacity to learn is an alive process -- you simply remain capable of
learning, you simply remain available, you simply remain open, ready to
receive. Learning is receptivity. Knowledge makes you less receptive
because you go on thinking that if you already know, what is there to
learn? When you already know. you miss much; when you don't know
anything you cannot miss anything.</p><p>Socrates said in his old age, 'Now I know nothing!' That was
maturity. At the very end he said, 'I know nothing.'</p><p>Life is so vast. How can this tiny mind know? At the most, glimpses
are enough. Even they are too much. Existence is so tremendously vast
and infinite, beginningless, endless... how can this tiny drop of
consciousness know it? It is enough even that a few glimpses come, a few
doors open, a few moments happen when you come in contact with
existence. But those moments cannot be turned into knowledge.</p><p>And your mind tends to do it -- then it becomes more and more
immature.</p><p>So the first thing is that you should be capable of learning and your
learning capacity should never be burdened by knowledge, never be
covered by dust. The mirror of learning should remain clean and fresh so
it can go on reflecting.</p><p>The mind can function in two ways. It can function like a camera:
once exposed, finished</p><p>-- the film immediately becomes knowledgeable and it loses its
learning capacity.</p><p>Exposed once and it already knows -- now it is useless; now it is not
capable of learning more. If you expose it again and again it will
become more confused. That's why people who know too much are always
afraid of learning... because they will become confused.</p><p>They are already exposed films. Then there is another type of
learning -- learning like a mirror. Expose the mirror for a thousand and
one times, it makes no difference -- if you come in front of the mirror,
you are reflected: if you go, the reflection goes. The mirror never
accumulates.</p><p>The film in the camera immediately accumulates -- it catches hold,
clings, but the mirror simply mirrors: you come in front, you are in it;
you go, you are gone.</p><p>This is the way to remain mature. Every child is born mature and
almost all people die immature. This will look very paradoxical but this
is so. Remain innocent and you will remain mature.</p><p>The second thing is that the immature mind is always interested in
trivia. The immature mind is always interested in things: money, houses,
cars, power, prestige...all trivia, all rot. The mature mind is
interested in existence, in being, in life itself. So when I say to you
that you have an immature mind I mean you are still interested in
things, not in persons; still interested in the outside, not in the
inside; still interested in objects, not in subjectivity; still
interested in the finite, not interested in the infinite.</p><p>Just watch your mind -- where it moves, what its fantasies are. If
you find a valuable diamond on the road and just there by its side a
rose has flowered, in what will you be interested? In the rose or in the
diamond? You will not be able</p><p>to see the rose if you are interested in the diamond; you will simply
miss the rose, it is valueless. Your eyes will be too clouded by the
diamond, your whole mind will become focused on the diamond, and you
will miss another diamond which was more alive -- the rose.</p><p>In the Hindu paradise they say roses are not ordinary roses, they are
made of diamonds. I don't know, but I have seen roses. If you can see
roses here exactly on this earth, they are made of diamonds -- so why go
far away? Not in paradise but here now, once you know how to see a rose
there is nothing comparable to it. And once you can see the rose you may
forget completely about the diamond.</p><p>It happened that Mulla Nasruddin came to me one day. He was very much
worried and he said, 'Ah, poor Mr. Jones. Did you hear, Osho, what
happened to him? He tripped at the top of the stairs, fell down the
whole flight, banged his head and died.'</p><p>Shocked, I said, 'Died?'</p><p>'Died,' he repeated with emphasis, 'and broke his glasses too!'</p><p>The immature mind is more interested in glasses than in life and
death and love; more interested in things, like houses and cars. When I
tell you that you have an immature mind, I mean you are still interested
in that which is worthless, non- essential. At the most it can be used,
at the most it can become a decoration in life, but it cannot replace
life, it cannot substitute life, it cannot become life itself.</p><p>And there are many people who have made it a life. I know a few rich
people who live such beggarly lives -- one cannot imagine it.</p><p>I used to know a man in Delhi who had six bungalows, all out on rent.
And he lived in a small dark cell with no children and no wife.</p><p>I asked him once, 'You have enough. Why do you go on living in this
small dark cell?</p><p>Why have you imposed this imprisonment upon yourself? What penance
are you doing?'</p><p>He said, 'None. I have always lived this way and it is perfectly
beautiful. And</p><p>people are living in those six bungalows.'</p><p>He goes to those bungalows only to collect rent. I asked him, 'Why
have you never married?'</p><p>'I am a poor man and women are very costly. I could not afford it,'
he said.</p><p>If you meet that man you will not be able to recognize that he owns
six big houses and earns a lot of money. What has happened to this man?
He is more interested in money than he is in himself, he is more
interested in money than he is in love, he is more interested in the
power that money brings -- but he has never shared anything with
anybody.</p><p>These people are not rare, they are very common. Everybody has such a
tendency inside.</p><p>And people go on rationalizing. Man is very clever -- he says, 'This
is not miserliness.</p><p>Don't misunderstand me. I am a simple man. I live a simple life. I am
a religious man, and a simple life is beautiful.'</p><p>If you are too interested in things you are immature. Shift your
attention. Become more and more interested in people rather than in
yourself.</p><p>I have a SANNYASIN here, Nisha. She always falls in love with
beggarly people and she is tremendously rich. Just a few days before,
she came and asked 'Why, Osho, do I go on falling in love with beggarly
people -- people who are almost on the street?' I know the reason...
with a beggarly man she need not be worried about her money. And she
thinks that she helps these people -- by food, by small things -- in
fact she has never fallen in love. She is so much in love with money
that she cannot fall in love with persons. She purchases these people
for money -- they are without any cost, without any risk. And they feel
obliged because she gives food, clothing, shelter -- they feel obliged,
so they pretend that they love her, and she goes on pretending that she
has fallen in love. This is a way to protect the money and this is a way
to remain closed, miserly.</p><p>And she is suffering, in pain, but she cannot see the point. She has
to learn how to share.</p><p>If you know how to share, you are mature; if you don't know how to
share, you are immature.</p><p>This sharing goes on on all levels, in all directions, in all
dimensions. So one of the most basic things to understand is the more
you share something, the more it grows in you.</p><p>Share whatsoever you have and it will grow; cling to it, become
afraid of sharing, of friendship, of love, and it will shrink'. Life
knows only one law and that law is of expansion and sharing.</p><p>Look at nature. Nature is such a spendthrift. When one flower is
needed, a thousand and one flowers will bloom. When you make love to a
woman or to a man, in each orgasm millions of cells are released. One
would have been enough because at the most one child can be conceived,
but millions of cells are released. One man can populate the whole earth
-- just one man! One ordinary man has at least four thousand
intercourses in his life -- one ordinary man -- and in each intercourse
millions of cells are released. The whole world, the whole population
that exists right now, can be produced by one man.</p><p>And yet the man will become the father of only two or three, if in
the West; or twelve, fourteen, fifteen, if in the East -- that's all.
For fifteen persons to be conceived, millions of cells are released.</p><p>Nature is a spendthrift. Where one flower is needed it produces
millions. One tree will produce.… Look at the Gulmohr -- millions of
seeds are ready. They will all fall down and a few, one, two, four,
five, ten, twenty, a hundred, may become trees. Why so many seeds? God
is not a miser. If you ask for one he gives millions. Just ask! Jesus
has said,</p><p>'Knock and the doors shall be opened unto you, ask and it shall be
given.' Remember, if you ask for one, millions will be given.</p><p>The moment you become miserly you are closed to the basic phenomenon
of life: expansion, sharing. The moment you start clinging to things,
you have missed the target</p><p>-- you have missed. Because things are not the target, you, your
innermost being, is the target -- not a beautiful house, but a beautiful
you; not much money, but a rich you; not many things, but an open being,
available to millions of things.</p><p>When I say you are immature, I mean you are too concerned with things
and you have not yet learned that life consists of consciousness -- of
beings, not of things. Things are to be used, they are needed, but don't
start living by them. Man cannot live by bread alone -- once living by
bread alone, things alone, you are already dead.</p><p>And the third thing: maturity is always spontaneous. It does not
plan, it makes no rehearsals.</p><p>People come to me.… Just the other night somebody was there. He said,
'I prepare so many questions when I come to see you. but when I come
here I forget. What do you do to me?' I am not doing anything at all. It
is YOU. The moment you prepare something you are already saying that it
is false. The real thing need not be prepared. In life.</p><p>rehearsals are not needed, they are needed in a drama. A drama is a
false thing. If you prepare your questions it means that those questions
are not yours. If you are thirsty and you come to me, will you forget
that you are thirsty and you would like your thirst to be quenched? How
can you forget? In fact, when you reach the side of a river thirst will
burn more intensely. The moment you see water flowing, and hear the
sound of gurgling, immediately all that you have been suppressing will
bubble up, it will respond, your whole being will say, 'I am thirsty!'
If you are thirsty you will not forget.</p><p>But you prepare questions. You prepare yourself to go to the river
and say, 'I am very thirsty.' What is the point of preparing? If you are
thirsty, you are; if you are not, by the time you reach to the river,
you will forget about it.</p><p>When I say you are immature I mean that you prepare your questions,
your inquiries.</p><p>They are mind things. they don't come from your heart, they are not
related to you, they have no roots in you.</p><p>It is related in George Bernard Shaw's life that once, at the opening
of one of his plays, he stepped forward at its conclusion with obvious
complaisance, to accept the rousing plaudits of the crowd. There was one
dissenter, however, who seized the occasion of a lull in the applause to
call out in stentorian tones, 'Your play stinks!'</p><p>There was a momentary horrified silence, but Shaw, unperturbed,
exclaimed from the stage, 'My friend, I agree with you completely, but
what are we two' -- here he waved his hand over the audience -- 'against
the great majority?'</p><p>And applause returned more loudly than ever.</p><p>You cannot prepare something like that, it is impossible It is a
spontaneous response --</p><p>hence the beauty of it. You cannot prepare for such things. And life
is such a continuous thing: either you act or you miss. Later on, you
will find a thousand and one answers --</p><p>you could have said this, you could have said that -- but they are of
no use.</p><p>Mark Twain was coming back home with his wife from a lecture hall. He
had just delivered a beautiful talk. His wife had not been present, she
had just come to pick him up.</p><p>On the way she asked, 'How was the lecture?'</p><p>Mark Twain said, 'Which one? The one that I prepared, or the one that
I delivered, or the one that I am thinking now that I should have
delivered? Which one?'</p><p>If you prepare, this is going to be so. Remain conscious, alert,
aware, and act out of your spontaneity. And not only will others see the
alive response of it, you also will be thrilled by your own response.
Not only will others be surprised, you will also be surprised
yourself.</p><p>I call a mind mature which retains the capacity to be surprised. A
mind is mature if it goes on continuously being surprised. by others, by
himself, by everything. Life is a constant wonder: he has no ready-made
plans or ready-made responses for it, he never knows what is going to
happen, he moves into the unknown each moment. And he never jumps ahead
of himself, he never lags behind himself, he remains simply himself,
wherever he is.</p><p>And, the last and most basic thing: when I say that you have an
immature mind, basically I mean that you have a mind. Mind as such is
immature; only no-mind is mature.</p><p>Maturity has nothing to do with mind because mind means all that you
know; mind means your experiences, mind means your past, your
rehearsals, your preparations. All these things are implied in the word
'mind.' Mind is not something in particular, it is the whole
accumulation, all the junk, the whole heap, of your dead past.</p><p>When I say, 'Be mature,' I mean become a no-mind. If you act
spontaneously, you will act out of no-mind. If you remain capable of
learning, you will remain capable of being a no-mind again and again and
again -- the mind will never be accumulated. If you are capable of
remaining alert-and spontaneous, able to be surprised by life and by
yourself, you will become by and by more and more interested in the
interior-most life, in the core of life. When you see a person, you will
not see just the body, your gaze will become penetrating, your gaze will
become like an x-ray. It will catch hold of the person -- of the
consciousness there, of the inner light there in the other person. The
body is just an abode -- you will meet the person, you will shake hands,
but not only hands, you will shake the person, you will meet the person.
And in your own life, by and by, you will become aware that the body is
just the outermost garment: you have to take care of it, it is not to be
neglected, it is valuable, but it is not the end. You are the master,
not the servant. And by and by, the more you penetrate withinwards, you
will see that the mind also is an innermost garment -- more valuable
than the body but not more valuable than you. You remain the supreme
value.</p><p>Once you know your supreme value, you have become mature; and once
you know your supreme value, you know the supreme value of all: all
beings are Buddhas -- nobody is less than that; the whole of life is
Divine; you are always walking on holy ground.</p><p>It is said that when Moses went to the hill to meet his God, the bush
was afire and from behind the bush he heard, 'Stop! Take your shoes off.
This is holy ground.' I have always liked it, loved it. But all ground
is holy ground and all bushes are afire with God. If you have not seen
this yet you have missed much. Look again. All bushes are afire with God
and from every bush comes the commandment, 'Stop and take your shoes
off. It is holy ground you are walking on. All ground, the whole earth,
the whole existence is sacred.</p><p>Once you have that feeling entering you, I will call you mature --
not before that. A mature mind is a religious mind.</p><p>The second question:</p><p>Question 2</p><p>WHY DO I MAKE MOUNTAINS OUT OF MOLEHILLS?</p><p>Because the ego does not feel good, at ease, with molehills -- it
wants mountains. Even if it is a misery, it should not be a molehill, it
should be an Everest. Even if it is miserable, the ego doesn't want to
be ordinarily miserable -- it wants to be extraordinarily miserable!</p><p>Bernard Shaw is reported to have said, 'If I am not going to be the
first in heaven, I would like to go to hell...but I would like to be the
first.' In Christianity there is only one hell and Bernard Shaw never
knew that in India we have a concept of seven hells. If he had heard
about Hindu hells he would have chosen the seventh, because in the fifth
he would have felt humiliated, others are still far ahead of him in the
seventh -- the real sinners, the great sinners, are in the seventh!</p><p>Either this way or that -- but one wants to be the first. Hence one
goes on making mountains out of molehills.</p><p>One woman hypochondriac died. The whole town felt relieved, the whole
medical profession felt relieved, because she was a constant trouble to
many people's heads, everywhere, all around. The family, the doctors,
the physicians -- she had troubled everybody and nobody was of any help.
And she relished the idea that nobody knew anything about the sort of
disease she was suffering from</p><p>-- it was an extraordinary disease. In fact there was no disease.</p><p>Then she died, and it was almost a celebration in the town. But when
they opened the will, she had written in her will that her request had
positively to be fulfilled. Her request was that a carved tombstone had
to be put on her tomb with these words inscribed on it: Now will you
believe I was sick?</p><p>In this way she would haunt the whole town again.</p><p>People go on and on, creating big problems out of nothing. I have
talked to thousands of people about their problems and I have not come
across a real problem yet! All problems are bogus -- you create them.
Because without problems you feel empty... then there is nothing to do,
nothing to fight with,</p><p>nowhere to go. People go from one guru to another, from one master to
another, from one psychoanalyst to another, from one encounter group to
another, because if they don't go, they feel empty, and they suddenly
feel life to be meaningless. You create problems so that you can feel
that life is a great work, a growth, and you have to struggle hard.</p><p>The ego can exist only when it struggles, remember -- when it fights.
And if I tell you,</p><p>'Kill three flies and you will become enlightened, you will not
believe me. You will say,</p><p>'Three flies? There doesn't seem to be much to that. And I will
become enlightened? That doesn't seem to be likely. If I say you will
have to kill seven hundred lions, of course that looks more like it!</p><p>The greater the problem, the greater the challenge -- and with
challenge your ego arises, soars high. You create problems. Problems
don't exist.</p><p>And now if you allow me, there are not even molehills. That too is
your trick. You say,</p><p>'Yes, there may not be mountains, but molehills?' No, not even
molehills are there --</p><p>those are your creations. First you create molehills out of nothing,
then you create mountains out of molehills. And the priests and the
psychoanalysts and the gurus, they are happy because their whole trade
exists because of you. If you don't create molehills out of nothing and
you don't make your molehills into mountains, what will be the point of
gurus helping you? First you have to be in a shape to be helped.</p><p>The real masters have been saying something else. They have been
saying, 'Please look what you are doing, what nonsense you are doing.
First you create a problem, then you go in search of a solution. Just
watch why you are creating the problem, just exactly in the beginning,
when you are creating the problem, is the solution -- don't create it!'
But that won't appeal to you because then you are suddenly thrown flat
upon yourself.</p><p>Nothing to do? No enlightenment? No satori? No samadhi? And you are
deeply</p><p>restless, empty, trying to stuff yourself with anything whatsoever.
You don't have any problems -- only this much has to be understood.</p><p>This very moment you can drop all problems</p><p>because they are your creations. Have another look at your problems:
the deeper you look, the smaller they will appear. Go on looking at them
and by and by they will start disappearing. Go on gazing and suddenly
you will find there is emptiness -- a beautiful emptiness surrounds you.
Nothing to do, nothing to be, because you are already that.</p><p>Enlightenment is not something to be achieved, it is just to be
lived. When I say that I achieved enlightenment, I simply mean that I
decided to live it. Enough is enough! And since then I have lived it. It
is a decision that now you are not interested in creating problems --
that's all. It is a decision that now you are finished with all this
nonsense of creating problems and finding solutions.</p><p>All this nonsense is a game you are playing with yourself: you
yourself are hiding and you yourself are seeking, you are both the
parties. And you know it! That's why when I say it you smile, you laugh.
I am not talking about anything ridiculous -- you understand it. You are
laughing at yourself. Just watch yourself laughing, just look at your
own smile</p><p>-- you understand it. It has to be so because it is your own game:
you are hiding and waiting for yourself to be able to seek and find
yourself.</p><p>You can find yourself right now because it is you that is hiding.
That's why Zen masters go on hitting. Whenever somebody comes and says,
'l would like to be a Buddha, the master gets very angry. Because he is
asking nonsense, he IS a Buddha. If Buddha comes to me and asks how to
be a Buddha, what am I supposed to do? I will hit his head.</p><p>'Whom do you think you are befooling? You are a Buddha.'</p><p>Don't make unnecessary trouble for yourself. And understanding will
dawn on you if you watch how you make a problem bigger and bigger and
bigger, how you spin it, and how you help the wheel to move faster and
faster and faster. Then suddenly you are at the top of your misery and
you are in need of the whole world's sympathy.</p><p>One sannyasin, Marga, wrote me a letter. She said, 'Osho, I feel very
sad because when you talk, you look at everyone except me.' Now, I am
not looking at anybody, but I have got eyes, so they have to be
somewhere. It is not that I am looking at somebody, I am not looking at
anybody. And you can see in my eyes that they are empty, they are
vacant. But if you are trying to find your reflection in them and you
don't, great sadness comes to you. Now there is a new problem. Now the
ego feels hurt -- looking at everybody else except you! Just watch how
you have made yourself an exception; extraordinary you have become. I
look at everybody, the ordinary mass, except you. You have become
unique. If I look at Marga -- which I am not going to do! Since I
received her letter, I am never going to look at her -- if I look at her
then the ego can have another trip: that I look only at her. Then that
will create a problem!</p><p>You are a great problem-creator... just understand this and suddenly
problems disappear.</p><p>You are perfectly in shape; you are born perfect, that is the whole
message. You are born perfect; perfection is your innermost nature. You
have just to live it. Decide, and live it.</p><p>But if you are not yet fed up with the game you can continue, but
don't ask why. You know. The why is simple: the ego cannot exist in
emptiness, it needs something to fight with. Even a ghost of your
imagination will do, but you need to fight with someone. The ego exists
only in conflict, the ego is not an entity, it is a tension. Whenever
there is a conflict, the tension arises and the ego exists;' when there
is no conflict the tension disappears and the ego disappears. Ego is not
a thing -- it is just a tension.</p><p>And of course nobody wants small tensions, everybody wants big
tensions. If your own problems are not enough, you start thinking about
humanity and the world and the future... socialism, communism, and all
that rubbish. You start thinking about it as if the whole world depends
on your advice. Then you think, 'What is going to happen in Israel?</p><p>What is going to happen in Africa?' And you go on advising, and you
create problems.</p><p>People become very excited, they cannot sleep because there is some
war going on. They become very excited. Their own life is so ordinary
that they will have</p><p>to reach extraordinariness from some other source. The nation is in
difficulty so they become identified with the nation. The culture is in
difficulty, the society is in difficulty -- now there are big problems
and you become identified. You are a Hindu and the Hindu culture is in
difficulty; you are a Christian and the church is in difficulty. The
whole world is at stake. Now you become big through your problem.</p><p>The ego needs some problems. If you understand this, in the very
understanding the mountains become molehills again, and then the
molehills also disappear. Suddenly there is emptiness, pure emptiness
all around. This is what enlightenment is all about -- a deep
understanding that there is no problem.</p><p>Then, with no problem to solve, what will you do? Immediately you
start living. You will eat, you will sleep, you will love, you will have
a chit-chat, you will sing, you will dance</p><p>-- what else is there to do? You have become a God, you have started
living.</p><p>If there is any God, one thing is certain: he will not have any
problems. That much is certain. Then what is he doing with all his time?
No problems, no psychiatrist to consult, no gurus to go and surrender
to... what is God doing? What will he do? He must be getting crazy,
whirling. No, he is living; his life is totally full with life. He is
eating, sleeping, dancing, having a love affair -- but without any
problems.</p><p>Start living this moment and you will see that the more you live, the
less problems there are. Because now that your emptiness is flowering
and living there is no need. When you don't live, the same energy goes
sour. The same energy which would have become a flower, is stuck; not
being allowed to bloom it becomes a thorn in the heart. It is the same
energy.</p><p>Force a small child to sit in the corner and tell him to become
completely immobile, unmoving. Watch what happens...just a few minutes
before, he was perfectly at ease, flowing; now his face will become red
because he will have to strain, hold himself. His whole body will become
rigid and he will try to fidget here and there and he will want to jump
out of himself. You have forced the energy -- now it has no purpose, no
meaning, no space to move, nowhere to bloom and flower; it is stuck,
frozen, rigid. The child is suffering a short death, a temporary death.
Now if you don't allow the child to run again and move around</p><p>the garden and play, he will start creating problems, he will
fantasize; in his mind he will Create problems and start fighting with
those problems. He will see a big dog and he will get afraid, or he will
see a ghost and he will have to fight and escape from him. Now he is
creating problems. The same energy that was just a moment before flowing
all around, in all directions, is stuck and becoming sour.</p><p>If people can dance a little more, sing a little more, be a little
more crazy, their energy will be flowing more, and their problems will
by and by disappear. Hence I insist so much on dance. Dance to orgasm;
let the whole energy become dance, and suddenly you will see that you
don't have any head -- the stuck energy in the head is moving all
around, creating beautiful patterns, pictures, movement. And when you
dance there comes a moment when your body is no longer a rigid thing, it
becomes flexible, flowing.</p><p>When you dance there comes a moment when your boundary is no longer
so clear; you melt and merge with the cosmos, the boundaries are
mixing.</p><p>Watch a dancer -- you will see that he has become an energy
phenomenon, no longer in a fixed form, no longer in a frame. He is
flowing out of his frame, out OT his form, and becoming more alive, more
and more alive. But only if you dance yourself will you know what really
happens. The head inside disappears; again you are a child. Then you
don't create any problems.</p><p>Live, dance, eat, sleep, do things as totally as possible. And
remember again and again: whenever you catch yourself creating any
problem, slip out of it, immediately. Once you get into the problem then
a solution will be needed. And even if you find a solution, out of that
solution a thousand and one problems will arise again. Once you miss the
first step you are in the trap. Whenever you see that now you are
slipping into a problem, catch hold of yourself, run, jump, dance, but
don't get into the problem. Do something immediately so that the energy
that was creating the problems becomes fluid, unfrozen, melts, goes back
to the cosmos.</p><p>Primitive people don't have many problems. I have come across
primitive groups in India who say they don't dream at all. Freud would
not be able to believe that it is possible.</p><p>They don't dream, but if sometimes somebody dreams -- it is a rare
phenomenon</p><p>-- the whole village fasts, prays to God. Something has gone wrong,
something wrong has happened... a man has dreamed.</p><p>It never happens in their tribe because they live so totally that
nothing is left in the head to be completed in the sleep. Whatsoever you
leave incomplete has to be completed in your dreams; whatsoever you have
not lived remains as a hang- over and completes itself in the mind --
that's what a dream is. The whole day you go on thinking. The thinking
simply shows that you have more energy than you use for living; you have
more energy than your so-called life needs.</p><p>You are missing real life. Use more energy. Then fresh energies will
be flowing. Just don't be a miser. Use them today; let today be complete
unto itself; tomorrow will take care of itself, don't be worried about
tomorrow. The worry, the problem, the anxiety, all simply show one
thing: that you are not living rightly, that your life is not yet a
celebration, a dance, a festivity. Hence all the problems.</p><p>If you live, ego disappears. Life knows no ego, it knows only living
and living and living.</p><p>Life knows no self, no center; life knows no separation. You breathe
-- life enters into you; you exhale you enter into life. There is no
separation. You eat, and trees enter into you through the fruit. Then
one day you die, you are buried in the earth, and the trees suck you up
and you become fruits. Your children will eat you again. You have been
eating your ancestors -- the trees have converted them into fruits. You
think you are a vegetarian? Don't be deceived by appearances. We are all
cannibals.</p><p>Life is one, it goes on moving. It comes into you; it passes through
you. In fact to say that it comes into you isn't right, because then it
seems as if life comes into you, and then passes out of you. You don't
exist -- only this life's coming and going does. You don't exist -- only
life exists in its tremendous forms, in its energy, in its millions of
delights.</p><p>Once you understand this, let that understanding be the only law.</p><p>And start living as Buddhas from this very moment. If you decide
otherwise, it is for you to decide -- but as I see it, it is a decision:
'I am not going to befool myself anymore.</p><p>Now I start living as a Buddha, in emptiness. I will not try to find
unnecessary occupations. I dissolve.'</p><p>The third question:</p><p>Question 3</p><p>I NOTICE THAT DEEP DOWN I WANT TO BE LOVED, ACCEPTED, LIKE THE</p><p>GREATEST MAN ON EARTH, THAT I WANT TO BE THE MOST FAMOUS</p><p>PERSON. AND I FEEL HURT WHEN SOMEONE REJECTS ME. WHAT TO DO</p><p>WITH THESE DREAMS?</p><p>If you understand that they are dreams then wash your face and have a
cup of tea. What is there to be done about it? Dreams are dreams -- why
be bothered?</p><p>But you don't understand that they are dreams. This is borrowed. You
know that they are not dreams -- that s why you are worried. Otherwise
why be worried? If in a dream you see that you have fallen ill, when you
wake up in the morning do you go to the doctor?</p><p>In my dream I was very ill and now some medication is needed. You
never go. You realize it was a dream -- finished! What is the point of
going to a doctor?</p><p>But you have not yet understood that these are dreams. These are
realities for you --</p><p>hence the problem.</p><p>I NOTICE THAT DEEP DOWN I WANT TO BE LOVED. If you want to be</p><p>loved --</p><p>love! Because whatsoever you give is returned back. If you want to be
loved forget about wanting to be loved, and in a thousand ways love will
come to you. Life reflects, life resounds, life echoes whatsoever you
throw at life. So if you want to be loved forget about wanting and being
loved -- that is not the point at</p><p>all then. Then simple is the rule</p><p>-- love.</p><p>And if you want to be accepted like the greatest man on earth, then
start accepting everybody as the greatest man on earth. Otherwise how
are they going to accept you as the greatest? They are also on the same
trip. They are not going to accept you as the greatest because then what
will happen to them? If you are the greatest, then who are they? Nobody
wants to be anything else.</p><p>Once it happened, a friend of Mulla Nasruddin was talking to Mulla
Nasruddin. They had met after many -- years. Both were bitter rivals;
both were poets. Both started to boast about the progress they had made
in their careers.</p><p>'You have no idea, Nasruddin, how many people read my poetry now,'
bragged the friend. 'My readers have doubled.'</p><p>'My God, my God!' cried Nasruddin. 'I had no idea you got
married!'</p><p>Everybody is on the same trip. If you want people to accept you as
the greatest man on earth, let this be the rule: whatsoever you want
others to do for you, do for them. But that is the trouble. The ego
wants you to be the greatest man on earth -- nobody else. Then you will
feel hurt. Because all are on the same trip -- can't you understand the
simple point? They are also waiting for you to accept them as the
greatest man.</p><p>I heard Mulla Nasruddin once. He was delivering a political
speech.</p><p>He Said, 'It is with some trepidation that I address an audience of
people all of whom are smarter than I am... all of them put together,
that is.'</p><p>Everybody is trying to be at the top of the world -- then you are in
competition with the whole world. Remember, you are going to be
defeated. One man fighting against the whole world -- that is the
situation.</p><p>If you see the point, there are two ways. One, forget about this
trip, be ordinary, simple, whatsoever you are. There is no need to be
great, the only need is to be real. Great is the wrong goal. To be
real.… I have come across a hip slogan: Be realistic -- plan for a
miracle. Yes. that s how it is. If you ale really realistic, you start
living the miracle. And the miracle is: if you are real, you don't want
to be</p><p>bothered with competition, comparison. Who bothers? You enjoy your
food, you enjoy your breathing, you enjoy the sunlight, you enjoy the
stars, you enjoy life, you enjoy being alive -- you are perfectly in
tune. in harmony with the Whole. What is the point of being a great man?
The great men, the so-called great men, are almost always phony -- they
have to be. They cannot be real persons. They are plastic. Because they
have chosen a wrong goal: to be great is an ego goal; to be real is
existential.</p><p>If you want to be great you will be in continuous conflict. And of
course you will be hurt by everybody. Not that everybody is trying to
hurt you, they are doing their own trip.</p><p>You are unnecessarily coming in their way.</p><p>Get out of this rat race. Sit under the tree by the side of the road;
it is tremendously beautiful and silent. Otherwise be ready to be
hurt.</p><p>One politician used to come to me. Once he was the president of the
Indian National Congress -- a great man in India.</p><p>And he told me, 'I am such a simple man. Why do people go on
spreading nasty things about me? Why do people want to hurt me?'</p><p>I told him, 'Nobody wants to hurt you. You are unnecessarily coming
in their way. They also want to be president of great parties -- you are
standing in their way. They have to push you away.' I told him, 'You
just remember what you did to the president before you.</p><p>The same thing they are trying to do with you -- leg-pulling.'</p><p>Once you are in a power post you are continuously being pulled and
pushed. It has to be so.</p><p>Ramakrishna used to tell a beautiful story.</p><p>A bird was flying with a dead mouse and twenty or thirty birds were
chasing him. The bird was very much worried.</p><p>'I am not doing anything to them, I am just carrying my dead mouse.
They are all after me.'</p><p>And they hit him hard and in the conflict, in the struggle, the bird
opened his mouth and the mouse dropped. Immediately they all flew
towards the mouse; they all forgot about him.</p><p>Then he sat upon a tree and brooded.</p><p>They were not against him, they were also on the same trip -- they
wanted the mouse.</p><p>If people are hurting you, open your mouth. You must be carrying a
dead mouse! Drop it!</p><p>And then sit -- if you can, sit on the tree or under the tree and
brood. And suddenly you will see that they have forgotten about you.
They are not concerned. They never were concerned. The ego is a dead
mouse.</p><p>Jones' oldest daughter had just given birth to a beautiful baby and
Jones was being congratulated.</p><p>He looked downcast, however, and a friend said, 'What's the matter,
Jones? Don't you like the idea of being a grandfather?'</p><p>Jones heaved an enormous sigh. 'No,' he said, 'I don't, but that
doesn't bother me so much.</p><p>It is just that it is so humiliating to have to go to bed with a
grandmother.'</p><p>Just watch your mind -- how it creates problems. The woman remains
the same but now she has become a grandmother -- and one feels
humiliated.</p><p>It is your idea that is giving you humiliation. If you are really
concerned with your own well-being then nobody is hurting you -- just
your own ideas. Drop them.</p><p>Or, two, it you feel good with them, don't be worried about the
hurts. Carry them. But you have a decision inside. If you want the ego
trip, if you want to be the greatest man in the world, then everybody is
going to prove that you are the worst man in the world.</p><p>Then have courage and heart to suffer all that. It is futile, but if
you choose that</p><p>way, it is your choice. If you really want your well-being and your
inner calm and silence and bliss, then these hurts are indicative: you
are carrying some wrong ideas within you.</p><p>Drop those ideas. The last question:, Question 4</p><p>I DON'T HAVE A QUESTION -- JUST A FEELING OF HOPELESSNESS. I
CAN'T</p><p>BELIEVE MY QUESTIONS, I HAVE A FEELING THEY COME FROM SOMETHING
BRITTLE AND UNREAL.</p><p>I DON'T HAVE A QUESTION -- JUST A FEELING OF HOPELESSNESS.</p><p>How does hopelessness arise? You must be hoping too much; it comes
out of too much hope.</p><p>If you don't hope, all hopelessness disappears. If you expect too
much, frustration is bound to come. if you are trying to succeed, you
are bound to fail. Whatsoever you want to try too hard, just the
opposite will happen.</p><p>You must have been trying too hard to fulfill some hope then
hopelessness comes. If you really want to get rid of hopelessness -- and
everybody wants that</p><p>-- then get rid of hope. Drop all hope and suddenly you will see that
with the hope, hopelessness has disappeared. Then one comes to an inner
tranquillity where no hope exists -- and no hopelessness. One is simply
calm and quiet and collected -- a deep reservoir of energy, a pool of
energy, cool.</p><p>But for that you have to sacrifice hope. The question shows that you
are still hoping.…</p><p>Go a little more deeper and further: if you are really hopeless,
hopelessness will disappear.</p><p>Let me tell it to you another way. Whenever a person says that he is
hopeless he simply says he is still clinging to the same hope which has
proved to be futile, of</p><p>which there is no indication of being fulfilled at all. One goes on
holding it, hoping against all hope.</p><p>Then hopelessness continues.</p><p>Don't hope for anything. There is no need because all that you can
hope for is already given. What more can you hope for?</p><p>You are here, everything is here -- just being is all. But you don't
appreciate, you are asking for some dead mouse, some power trip, some
ego trip, some success in the eyes of the world. Those are not going to
be fulfilled, even Alexanders have failed. Even Alexander dies a poor
man, a beggar, because everything that you accumulate is snatched back
from you, you go empty-handed. Empty- handed you come; empty-handed you
go.</p><p>So why bother about success, riches, power -- material or spiritual?
Just be.… And being is the greatest miracle. Turn within yourself --
what Buddha calls PARABVRUTTI.</p><p>Turn yourself a complete turn, a total turn, and suddenly you are so
full of joy, you don't need anything. In fact you have so much that you
would like to shower it on others.</p><p>But things go on moving from one extreme to another. You hope -- then
by and by the pendulum moves towards hopelessness. If you are too much
in love with life, by and by you move towards suicide. If you are too
religious, by and by you move and become anti-religious. The pendulum
goes on moving towards the opposite.</p><p>Somewhere in the middle one has to stop. And if you stop in the
middle, time stops with you. And when time stops, all hope, all desires
have stopped. You start living. Now, now is the only time and here is
the only space.</p><p>Let me tell you one story. It is a very beautiful Jewish
anecdote.</p><p>Young Sammy Moskowitz had just bought himself a motor scooter, but he
had been brought up in orthodox fashion and wasn't the least bit sure
whether it was fitting for an orthodox Jew to ride one. He thought that
the best way out would be to get his reverend rabbi to teach him a
barucha -- a traditional prayer of blessing -- to intone over the motor
scooter before he drove it. Surely that would</p><p>make it proper for him to use it.</p><p>He therefore approached his rabbi and said, 'Rabbi, I have bought a
motor scooter and I wish to know if you could teach me a barucha to say
over it each morning.'</p><p>The rabbi said, 'What is a motor scooter?'</p><p>Sammy explained, and the rabbi shook his head. 'As far as I know,
there is no appropriate barucha for the occasion and I strongly suspect
that riding a motor scooter is a sin. I forbid you to use it.'</p><p>Sammy was very downhearted for from his very soul he longed to drive
his motor scooter, which had set him back a considerable sum. A thought
occurred to him. Why not seek a second and perhaps more liberal opinion
-- from a rabbi who was not orthodox, but merely conservative?</p><p>He found a conservative rabbi, who, unlike the orthodox rabbi earlier
consulted, was not in the traditional long coat at all but wore a dark
business suit. The conservative rabbi said, What is a motor
scooter?'</p><p>Sammy explained.</p><p>The rabbi thought for a while, then said, 'I suppose there's nothing
wrong about riding a motor scooter, but still I don't know of any
appropriate barucha and if your conscience hurts you without one, then
don't drive it.'</p><p>He journeyed out to the suburbs and met Rabbi Richmond Ellis, in his
knickerbockers, about to leave for the golf-links on his motor
scooter.</p><p>Sammy grew terribly excited, 'It's all right for a Jew to ride a
motor scooter?' he said. 'I've got one but I didn't know.'</p><p>'Sure, kid,' said the rabbi. 'Nothing wrong with the motor scooter at
all. Ride it in good health.'</p><p>'Then give me a barucha for it.'</p><p>The reformed rabbi thought, then said, 'What's a barucha?'</p><p>The orthodox doesn't know what a motor scooter is and the progressive
is not aware of what a barucha is.</p><p>From religion, too much dogmatic religion, people become too
irreligious. When they leave the church, they move to the
prostitute.</p><p>Somewhere a deep balance is needed. Just between the two, exactly
between the two, is transcendence.</p><p>So, you have lived with hope -- now the hope has failed and you are
living in hopelessness. Now, let hopelessness also fail; you drop hope
and hopelessness together.</p><p>You just transcend that attitude which lives in the future. Live here
now! Living in hope is living in the future, which is really postponing
life. It is not a way of living, but a way of suicide. There is no need
for any hope and there is no need to feel hopeless. Live here now. Life
is tremendously blissful, it is showering here and you are looking
somewhere else. It is just in front of your eyes, but your eyes have
moved far away, they look at the horizon. It is within you, but you are
not there.</p><p>I am not for hope; I am not for hopelessness. I am against all
extremism. All excess is futile.</p><p>Buddha used to say, 'My path is the middle path.' That is the path of
transcendence.</p><p>Ancient Music in the Pines Chapter #3</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=_index>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

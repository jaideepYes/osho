First he explains the literal meaning of her name.)\nAnand means bliss. Silvia symbolises the profound silence that prevails in the woods. It comes from the Latin mythological figure, Sylvanus; he is the god of the woods.\nSo your name will means bliss and profound silence.\nA man is whole only when both bliss and silence are present together in such a deep harmony that they enhance and enrich each other. It is easy to be blissful if\none is ready to forget all about silence, and vice versa is also true; it is easy to be silent if one drops the idea of being blissful. But to choose one is to remain half, and one cannot feel contented with half. Less than whole is not enough, more than whole is not needed and is not possible either.\nA person who is blissful without silence is shallow. The person who is silent without bliss is serious, sad, cold and dead. Both become significant when they are together. The blissful silence is a silence with songs; the silent bliss is non- feverish, it is sane. It is not shallow, it has depth. Silence gives depth, and bliss gives dance to that depth. And to be a sannyasin, particularly my sannyasin, means that you should be trying to achieve this ultimate harmony.\nIt is possible, it is not impossible -- certainly it is difficult but the difficult has to be accepted as a challenge. And the moment you accept the difficult as a challenge it is no more difficult, it becomes an adventure.\nMASTER IS A MUST\n(Andre means courageous, Osho tells another sannyasin. And it was also the name of the first disciple that Jesus called to join him.)\nIt just have been just a coincidence, but it becomes significant because a man like Jesus can only call the courageous to be his disciples. It needs guts to be a disciple of a master.\nIt is very easy to be a Christian, a Hindu, a Mohammedan, to belong to something traditional, conventional, established, but to be with a master is to belong to a rebellion. To be with a master is to belong to something absolutely new and fresh, to something which has no tradition behind it, no convention supporting it, no establishment in which it can get its roots. It has to depend only on the love of those few courageous ones who gather around a master.\nTo belong to an old religion is to belong to the past, in a sense to something dead. It was tremendously beautiful to be with Jesus but to be a Christian is just ugly. To walk with Buddha is a rare gift -- only the fortunate ones, the blessed ones, can walk with the Buddha -- but to be a Buddhist is very simple and cheap.\nOnce the master is gone then belonging to the ideology, to the doctrine, has no significant at all.\nReligion exists between the alive master and the courageous disciple -- in that communion. So religion exists only once in a while on the earth. It has no continuum, no continuity. It existed when Jesus was here but it existed only for those few people who communed with him, then it disappeared. Then only footprints on the sands of time are left and people go on worshipping them. But to worship the footprint of a Buddha or a Jesus is not to be religious; to walk with a Buddha or a Jesus is to be religious. Hence the true seeker always has to find a master; there is no other way. He cannot find the truth in the scriptures, he cannot find it in any established church. It is possible only in the company of someone who has achieved it, who has realised it, who has become it. And then there is great peace and a bliss that you have not even dreamt about. All that you can think about bliss is only a negative idea, that there will be no misery; that's all that 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nyou can imagine.\nIf you talk about light to a man who lives in darkness he will think only one thing, that there will be no darkness. But light is far more than just absence of darkness. But the person who lives in darkness cannot imagine anything more than that, The absence of darkness is only one aspect of light. But the presence of colours and rainbows and clouds and people and faces and the beauty of a sunset -- these the man who lives in darkness cannot comprehend. He cannot even dream about them because you can only dream about that which you have experienced in some way. Your dreams are not original, it is impossible to dream an original dream. It is all rubbish and junk and old and gathered from here and there, from a movie, from television, from a story, from a novel, from peoples' lives, from your own experiences -- just small pieces put together somehow that's why it is so crazy.\nIt is just a collage, not even a painting. You have taken one leg from somebody, one eye from somebody else -- and the leg may belong to an elephant, the eye may belong to a mosquito, so the collage is going to be very insane.\nIt is said that Charles Darwin's disciples once tried to befool him. It was his\nbirthday and for his birthday present they made a collage of an insect: the legs were from one insect and the head was from another insect. They glued it together so perfectly that it really looked like one insect.\nThey presented it to Darwin and they asked 'Sir, can you tell us what kind of insect this is, to what category it belongs?' -- because that was his whole work. He was working on all kinds of species -- animals, insects and birds. He looked at it, he could not believe his eyes. He had never even thought about such a thing, he had never come across such an insect.\nThen he asked 'Does this insect hum?' They said 'Yes.' Then he said 'This is humbug.' But that's what your dreams are humbug!\nYou cannot even think of what bliss is, what truth is -- and it is better not to think about it, because whatsoever you think will be humbug. It is better to keep your mind clean, it is better to know that you don't know. Only in a loving relationship with someone who has known does it happen. It is a communion not between two heads but between two hearts. Something transpires, something like a flame jumps from the master to the disciple and suddenly his unlit candle is lit.\nFor that one needs courage, the courage to get out of the old structures -- because they are convenient, comfortable, familiar -- the courage to go from the familiar into the unfamiliar. Then bliss is yours, truth is yours, freedom is yours. All these significant values together is the meaning of the words 'god', 'freedom'\n'bliss', 'truth' 'love' -- altogether. God is not a person but all these qualities together like many fragrances melting and merging into each other and creating a totally new fragrance.\nThat fragrance is god.\nMEDITATION MAKES MEDIATORS OF MEN\nIt is impossible to know that you are appointed by the whole, that you are created for a special purpose, for a certain destiny to be fulfilled, for a message to be delivered. It is impossible without meditation to conceive that your life is significant to existence, that you are not accidental, that you are not here just by chance, that there is a hidden hand behind you.\nBut that hand is revealed only in deep meditation.\nMeditation means a thoughtless state of awareness. Mind consists only of thoughts. Behind the thought, there is something more but because of so many thoughts we have become completely oblivious of it, it is the awareness of the thoughts. Because you can be aware of thoughts, certainly you are behind the thoughts\n-- farther, deeper. You can see the thoughts moving on the screen of the mind like a film. Certainly you are not a thought, you are totally different.\nA thought cannot watch other thoughts -- that's impossible. A computer knows nothing about its thoughts; it is just a machine, there is no awareness behind it. It is meditation which reveals to you that you are not only a machine, that are not only a mind but something more, something far superior.\nMind is constantly changing and your awareness is absolutely still, unchanging. Mind is time and your awareness is eternity. When mind stops it becomes easy to experience your awareness because all the turmoil and the noise is gone. Only in that experience is there a possibility to feel that you are here for a certain purpose. The purpose -- that you are appointed, that you are not just thrown here, that you are needed and that you have to fulfil a certain destiny -- immediately becomes clear. And unless that is 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nfulfilled you will not feel at ease; you will remain tense, you will remain in anguish. The moment that destiny is fulfilled one feels immense contentment, as if one has come home. One has done the work.\nIt is just as if you are painting a picture and when it is complete there is a great relaxation and the joy of doing something perfectly wells now you can rest, you can relax. Until that painting was finished there was turmoil and anguish. Every creator knows that anxiety: something wants to be expressed, to be sung, to be put to music, to be painted; unless you fulfil that longing it will go on haunting you, goading you to do it.\nExactly like that existence has a certain need of you otherwise you would not\nhave been here. Just the fact that one is, is enough proof that one is needed in some way. Of courage we don't know in what way; we don't know because we don't know our own source of consciousness.\nThe programme is there -- meditation reveals the whole programme. You become an open book to yourself. That's the beauty of meditations it is a key which helps you to read your own destiny.\nSo put your total energy into meditation while you are here, and then make it a point that whenever you have time, rather than wasting it, rather than killing it -- use it for meditation. The deeper you go into meditation, the better: the closer you will be coming to god.\nTHE WOMB OF AWARENESS\n(Osho talks to Navajato about the second birth, that which happens through sannyas. Only if one is born a second time does the first one mean anything.)\nSocrates is right when he says that a master is only a midwife. That is exactly the purpose of the masters to help you to be born anew, to help you to be born as a soul.\nPeople are well aware that they are bodies; they think in terms of the physical, of the material. And science stops there too, because science is created by ordinary people. The day Buddhas create science will be the greatest blessing to humanity because they will create a totally new kind of science. This science is created by ordinary, unconscious humanity, howsoever intelligent they are. The Darwins, the Edisons, the Einsteins -- howsoever intelligent they are, they are unconscious. They don't know about the second birth, they are not aware of their own selves. They cannot lead humanity to the ultimate peak of bliss, silence, truth.\nYes, they can make life a little bit more comfortable, a little more convenient, but on the other hand they will also make many dangers for life. Because they are unconscious they don't know what they are doing.\nSo on one hand they go on creating medicine to help humanity, to overcome illness and disease -- they even go on researching into how to help humanity not to get old, how to live a longer life in a perfectly healthy way -- and on the other hand the same people go on creating atom bombs, the same people go on\ncreating destructive weapons.\nYou can see how unconscious, how insane, must be our scientists. This seems very illogical if you are trying to help humanity to live longer then please stop creating atom bombs and hydrogen bombs and death rays and all kinds of destructive things -- because what is the point of helping humanity to live long when you are piling up atomic weapons? Sooner or later any mad person can trigger a world war.\nAnd where can you find more mad people than in politics? Politics belongs to the nuts. Now this Reagan... he has thrown out the peanut and he is a big nut himself. Now the peanut is replaced by a big nut!\nThis man can prove dangerous.\nCarter was just a peanut -- not dangerous. You can make peanut butter or something (much laughter)...\nHe was of much use but not dangerous either. But this Reagan? -- this man can be dangerous, he can drag the whole world into a war at any moment.\nJust one mad person who is in power is enough. And people are mad. Just the other day I read a news item: one man in America, in California... of course it can only happen in California-land! California is something far-out! It does not belong to this planet; it is a planet unto itself. A man became so angry with the cockroaches that he burned his house (laughter) and then seeing what he had done he killed himself.\nCockroach only cause of the whole thing!\nI know cockroaches are not that beautiful... but to burn the whole house is too much! And then he realised... only when he saw the house going up in smoke did he realise what he had done, then he killed himself.\nNow you see, such people can be in power, they are in power. Science is created by people who don't know about their consciousness at all.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nA totally different science will be possible through meditation, through awakened people, through people who are reborn. Then it will be creative, then it will think more of ecology and nature. It will think less in terms of nations, religions, boundaries; it will think more of humanity, life, birds, trees. It will be a totally different vision.\nThe second birth is a very essential phenomenon, moreso now than ever. And that's my effort here, to create through my sannyasins at least the foundation for a different kind of humanity, for people who will live out of awareness, who will be alert about what they are doing, what they are thinking, who will be guided by their inner light.\nThat's a new birth, that is the meaning name. And it has to be realised so it becomes a reality too, not only a name.\nGOD ADORES A VACUUM\n(Vinito means absolutely humble, Osho tells another swami.) But when I use the word 'humble' I don't mean something against the ego, I mean the absence of the ego.\nIf something is against the ego then it still carries some relationship to the ego. Maybe the ego is standing upside-down so it looks opposite, but the ego is there.\nWhenever a person cultivates humbleness he becomes proud of his humbleness -\n- that is ego coming in from the backdoor. He becomes very egoistic in a subtle way; his ego is not gross, it is very saintly, holy, holier-than-thou, but it is still ego.\nWhen I use the word 'humble' I don't mean the opposite of ego but the absence of the ego -- and there is a tremendous difference. The absence of the ego is the absence of all kinds of ego. The holy ego, the spiritual ego, are all rejected. One is not even proud of one's humbleness ... because that is a contradiction in terms. The ego is so absent that one is not even conscious of one's humbleness. One is simply humble, there is not even a self consciousness about it Then humbleness is true and that humbleness becomes the opening to god.\nGod can descend in you when you are not, when you are absolutely non- existential. When god is absolutely existential in you, within you, in each cell of your being, in each fibre of your existence, then he pulsates, he beats, he breathes; you are simply no more.\nBecome a zero and you become the abode of god. My sannyasins have to be zeroes, just zeroes.\nWAIT WATCHER\n(Sudhir means utterly patient, capable of waiting infinitely, Osho tells Ma Sudhir.) It is one of the most significant qualities for a seeker of truth, to be able to wait. It cannot be done in a hurried way, you cannot have it instantly; it is not like instant coffee.\nTruth cannot be achieved through the American way of life. Maybe it is because of this that this country is so lazy and lousy but it has created the greatest number of Buddhas in the world. That laziness and lousiness may be the cause of it all (laughter)... because people can wait, people are patient, nobody is in a hurry. If somebody says 'I will come to see you today,' even if he comes within the week he is perfectly in time! (laughter) Nobody will object about what you said and that now one week has passed. That is not even mentioned, nobody takes any notice of it.\nPeople are moving with a very slow speed, at snail's speed. There is no hurry to reach anywhere. When you are in a hurry you cannot enjoy the journey; you are focussed on the goal. And when you are not in a hurry you can enjoy the sideshows and the sight-seeings and sometimes you can go on a side-path and enjoy a waterfall or a river and have a swim and forget all about the goal. You can go astray, it is allowed. The journey in itself is so beautiful that who bothers about the goal? And what is the hurry? -- life is eternal so some day we are bound to reach. How long can we go on missing?\nIt is said about Diogenes, a Greek mystic, that he went to see a show -- an archer was giving a show. He was so lousy that not even a single arrow reached the target. Diogenes went and sat by the side of the target.\nThe crowd said 'What are you doing?' He said 'This is the safest place! This man can shoot anywhere, but this is the safest places his arrows are not going to reach\nhere.' 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nLife should be taken more joyously, more cheerfully, less seriously. Certainly truth has to be enquired into but not in a hurried way. And then a miracle happens: the less you are in a hurry, the quicker it happens. If you are ready to wait for infinity it can happen instantly, because the very capacity to wait shows your trust. The very capacity to wait shows your surrender; it shows that you know it is going to happen sooner or later and you are not trying to force it in any way to happen right now.\nYou are allowing existence to take its own time. When spring comes the flowers will blossom.\nThat is the meaning of Sudhirs learn to wait for the spring. It always comes. This is trust, that it always comes. If it came to Buddha, to Jesus, to Zarathustra, why not to you?\nOnce this attitude settles you become relaxed, calm and quiet. And in that calmness and quietness, in that relaxed state, it can come. It can come right now\n(There is a smile in Osho's voice as he asks)\n-- How long will you be here?\n(She shrugs her shoulders, the very picture of total relaxation. The group laughs and Osho chuckles.)\n-- That's right. Good, Sudhir, good! BLISS IS IT\nPleasure is very momentary, it exists only for a split second. Happiness is a little\nlonger, joy even a little longer, more suffused, but they are both part of time. Pleasure, happiness, joy -- they are all part of time, and anything that is part of time is bound to come and go, it cannot be forever.\nTime means change, time means flux, movement. Nothing can be static in time, nothing can be at a standstill. But bliss is eternal, hence it is not part of time, it is beyond time. And to attain to bliss one has to go beyond time.\nWhen I say one has to go beyond time the task seems to be impossible, how can one go beyond time? --\nbecause as far as physics or science is concerned there is no possibility of going beyond time and space because the whole existence consists only of time and is only a fourth dimension of space, so you cannot go beyond it -- according to science. But according to the awakened ones you can go beyond time because in fact you are beyond time; you just have to search within yourself for a point which is already beyond time.\nLooked at in that light things have a different perspective: mind becomes equivalent to time. Mind is a flux, constantly changing. Just behind the mind is your awareness, which is the same, always the same.\nWhen you were a child it was the same, you became a young man, it was the same, when you become old it will be the same. When you were in the womb of your mother it was the same, when you were not born it was the same, when you are dying it will be the same, when you are dead it will be the same. There will be no difference at all, it is always the same. It is the centre of the cyclone. The mind is like the cyclone and awareness is the centre,,it is in the centre and yet beyond, it is within and yet beyond.\nThis is the whole work of meditation, this is the commitment of sannyas to search for that which is already beyond time.

CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>[NOTE: This is an unedited tape transcript of an unpublished darshan
diary, which has been scanned and cleaned up. It is for reference
purposes only.]</p><p>SILENCE IN YOUR SONG</p><p>(... and a song in your silence. This is the ultimate harmony Osho
says to Anand Silvia. First he explains the literal meaning of her
name.)</p><p>Anand means bliss. Silvia symbolises the profound silence that
prevails in the woods. It comes from the Latin mythological figure,
Sylvanus; he is the god of the woods.</p><p>So your name will means bliss and profound silence.</p><p>A man is whole only when both bliss and silence are present together
in such a deep harmony that they enhance and enrich each other. It is
easy to be blissful if</p><p>one is ready to forget all about silence, and vice versa is also
true; it is easy to be silent if one drops the idea of being blissful.
But to choose one is to remain half, and one cannot feel contented with
half. Less than whole is not enough, more than whole is not needed and
is not possible either.</p><p>A person who is blissful without silence is shallow. The person who
is silent without bliss is serious, sad, cold and dead. Both become
significant when they are together. The blissful silence is a silence
with songs; the silent bliss is non- feverish, it is sane. It is not
shallow, it has depth. Silence gives depth, and bliss gives dance to
that depth. And to be a sannyasin, particularly <em>my</em> sannyasin,
means that you should be trying to achieve this ultimate harmony.</p><p>It is possible, it is not impossible -- certainly it is difficult but
the difficult has to be accepted as a challenge. And the moment you
accept the difficult as a challenge it is no more difficult, it becomes
an adventure.</p><p>MASTER IS A MUST</p><p>(Andre means courageous, Osho tells another sannyasin. And it was
also the name of the first disciple that Jesus called to join him.)</p><p>It just have been just a coincidence, but it becomes significant
because a man like Jesus can only call the courageous to be his
disciples. It needs guts to be a disciple of a master.</p><p>It is very easy to be a Christian, a Hindu, a Mohammedan, to belong
to something traditional, conventional, established, but to be with a
master is to belong to a rebellion. To be with a master is to belong to
something absolutely new and fresh, to something which has no tradition
behind it, no convention supporting it, no establishment in which it can
get its roots. It has to depend only on the love of those few courageous
ones who gather around a master.</p><p>To belong to an old religion is to belong to the past, in a sense to
something dead. It was tremendously beautiful to be with Jesus but to be
a Christian is just ugly. To walk with Buddha is a rare gift -- only the
fortunate ones, the blessed ones, can walk with the Buddha -- but to be
a Buddhist is very simple and cheap.</p><p>Once the master is gone then belonging to the ideology, to the
doctrine, has no significant at all.</p><p>Religion exists between the alive master and the courageous disciple
-- in that communion. So religion exists only once in a while on the
earth. It has no continuum, no continuity. It existed when Jesus was
here but it existed only for those few people who communed with him,
then it disappeared. Then only footprints on the sands of time are left
and people go on worshipping them. But to worship the footprint of a
Buddha or a Jesus is not to be religious; to walk with a Buddha or a
Jesus is to be religious. Hence the true seeker always has to find a
master; there is no other way. He cannot find the truth in the
scriptures, he cannot find it in any established church. It is possible
only in the company of someone who has achieved it, who has realised it,
who has become it. And then there is great peace and a bliss that you
have not even dreamt about. All that you can think about bliss is only a
negative idea, that there will be no misery; that's all that 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>you can imagine.</p><p>If you talk about light to a man who lives in darkness he will think
only one thing, that there will be no darkness. But light is far more
than just absence of darkness. But the person who lives in darkness
cannot imagine anything more than that, The absence of darkness is only
one aspect of light. But the presence of colours and rainbows and clouds
and people and faces and the beauty of a sunset -- these the man who
lives in darkness cannot comprehend. He cannot even dream about them
because you can only dream about that which you have experienced in some
way. Your dreams are not original, it is impossible to dream an original
dream. It is all rubbish and junk and old and gathered from here and
there, from a movie, from television, from a story, from a novel, from
peoples' lives, from your own experiences -- just small pieces put
together somehow that's why it is so crazy.</p><p>It is just a collage, not even a painting. You have taken one leg
from somebody, one eye from somebody else -- and the leg may belong to
an elephant, the eye may belong to a mosquito, so the collage is going
to be very insane.</p><p>It is said that Charles Darwin's disciples once tried to befool him.
It was his</p><p>birthday and for his birthday present they made a collage of an
insect: the legs were from one insect and the head was from another
insect. They glued it together so perfectly that it really looked like
one insect.</p><p>They presented it to Darwin and they asked 'Sir, can you tell us what
kind of insect this is, to what category it belongs?' -- because that
was his whole work. He was working on all kinds of species -- animals,
insects and birds. He looked at it, he could not believe his eyes. He
had never even thought about such a thing, he had never come across such
an insect.</p><p>Then he asked 'Does this insect hum?' They said 'Yes.' Then he said
'This is humbug.' But that's what your dreams are humbug!</p><p>You cannot even think of what bliss is, what truth is -- and it is
better not to think about it, because whatsoever you think will be
humbug. It is better to keep your mind clean, it is better to know that
you don't know. Only in a loving relationship with someone who has known
does it happen. It is a communion not between two heads but between two
hearts. Something transpires, something like a flame jumps from the
master to the disciple and suddenly his unlit candle is lit.</p><p>For that one needs courage, the courage to get out of the old
structures -- because they are convenient, comfortable, familiar -- the
courage to go from the familiar into the unfamiliar. Then bliss is
yours, truth is yours, freedom is yours. All these significant values
together is the meaning of the words 'god', 'freedom'</p><p>'bliss', 'truth' 'love' -- altogether. God is not a person but all
these qualities together like many fragrances melting and merging into
each other and creating a totally new fragrance.</p><p>That fragrance is god.</p><p>MEDITATION MAKES MEDIATORS OF MEN</p><p>It is impossible to know that you are appointed by the whole, that
you are created for a special purpose, for a certain destiny to be
fulfilled, for a message to be delivered. It is impossible without
meditation to conceive that your life is significant to existence, that
you are not accidental, that you are not here just by chance, that there
is a hidden hand behind you.</p><p>But that hand is revealed only in deep meditation.</p><p>Meditation means a thoughtless state of awareness. Mind consists only
of thoughts. Behind the thought, there is something more but because of
so many thoughts we have become completely oblivious of it, it is the
awareness of the thoughts. Because you can be aware of thoughts,
certainly you are behind the thoughts</p><p>-- farther, deeper. You can see the thoughts moving on the screen of
the mind like a film. Certainly you are not a thought, you are totally
different.</p><p>A thought cannot watch other thoughts -- that's impossible. A
computer knows nothing about its thoughts; it is just a machine, there
is no awareness behind it. It is meditation which reveals to you that
you are not only a machine, that are not only a mind but something more,
something <em>far</em> superior.</p><p>Mind is constantly changing and your awareness is absolutely still,
unchanging. Mind is time and your awareness is eternity. When mind stops
it becomes easy to experience your awareness because all the turmoil and
the noise is gone. Only in that experience is there a possibility to
feel that you are here for a certain purpose. The purpose -- that you
are appointed, that you are not just thrown here, that you are needed
and that you have to fulfil a certain destiny -- immediately becomes
clear. And unless that is 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>fulfilled you will not feel at ease; you will remain tense, you will
remain in anguish. The moment that destiny is fulfilled one feels
immense contentment, as if one has come home. One has done the work.</p><p>It is just as if you are painting a picture and when it is complete
there is a great relaxation and the joy of doing something perfectly
wells now you can rest, you can relax. Until that painting was finished
there was turmoil and anguish. Every creator knows that anxiety:
something wants to be expressed, to be sung, to be put to music, to be
painted; unless you fulfil that longing it will go on haunting you,
goading you to do it.</p><p>Exactly like that existence has a certain need of you otherwise you
would not</p><p>have been here. Just the fact that one is, is enough proof that one
is needed in some way. Of courage we don't know in what way; we don't
know because we don't know our own source of consciousness.</p><p>The programme is there -- meditation reveals the whole programme. You
become an open book to yourself. That's the beauty of meditations it is
a key which helps you to read your own destiny.</p><p>So put your total energy into meditation while you are here, and then
make it a point that whenever you have time, rather than wasting it,
rather than killing it -- use it for meditation. The deeper you go into
meditation, the better: the closer you will be coming to god.</p><p>THE WOMB OF AWARENESS</p><p>(Osho talks to Navajato about the second birth, that which happens
through sannyas. Only if one is born a second time does the first one
mean anything.)</p><p>Socrates is right when he says that a master is only a midwife. That
is exactly the purpose of the masters to help you to be born anew, to
help you to be born as a soul.</p><p>People are well aware that they are bodies; they think in terms of
the physical, of the material. And science stops there too, because
science is created by ordinary people. The day Buddhas create science
will be the greatest blessing to humanity because they will create a
totally new kind of science. This science is created by ordinary,
unconscious humanity, howsoever intelligent they are. The Darwins, the
Edisons, the Einsteins -- howsoever intelligent they are, they are
unconscious. They don't know about the second birth, they are not aware
of their own selves. They cannot lead humanity to the ultimate peak of
bliss, silence, truth.</p><p>Yes, they can make life a little bit more comfortable, a little more
convenient, but on the other hand they will also make many dangers for
life. Because they are unconscious they don't know what they are
doing.</p><p>So on one hand they go on creating medicine to help humanity, to
overcome illness and disease -- they even go on researching into how to
help humanity not to get old, how to live a longer life in a perfectly
healthy way -- and on the other hand the same people go on creating atom
bombs, the same people go on</p><p>creating destructive weapons.</p><p>You can see how unconscious, how insane, must be our scientists. This
seems very illogical if you are trying to help humanity to live longer
then please stop creating atom bombs and hydrogen bombs and death rays
and all kinds of destructive things -- because what is the point of
helping humanity to live long when you are piling up atomic weapons?
Sooner or later any mad person can trigger a world war.</p><p>And where can you find more mad people than in politics? Politics
belongs to the nuts. Now this Reagan... he has thrown out the peanut and
he is a big nut himself. Now the peanut is replaced by a big nut!</p><p>This man can prove dangerous.</p><p>Carter was just a peanut -- not dangerous. You can make peanut butter
or something (much laughter)...</p><p>He was of much use but not dangerous either. But this Reagan? -- this
man can be dangerous, he can drag the whole world into a war at any
moment.</p><p>Just one mad person who is in power is enough. And people
<em>are</em> mad. Just the other day I read a news item: one man in
America, in California... of course it can only happen in
California-land! California is something far-out! It does not belong to
this planet; it is a planet unto itself. A man became so angry with the
cockroaches that he burned his house (laughter) and then seeing what he
had done he killed himself.</p><p>Cockroach only cause of the whole thing!</p><p>I know cockroaches are not that beautiful... but to burn the whole
house is too much! And then he realised... only when he saw the house
going up in smoke did he realise what he had done, then he killed
himself.</p><p>Now you see, such people can be in power, they <em>are</em> in power.
Science is created by people who don't know about their consciousness at
all.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>A totally different science will be possible through meditation,
through awakened people, through people who are reborn. Then it will be
creative, then it will think more of ecology and nature. It will think
less in terms of nations, religions, boundaries; it will think more of
humanity, life, birds, trees. It will be a totally different vision.</p><p>The second birth is a very essential phenomenon, moreso now than
ever. And that's my effort here, to create through my sannyasins at
least the foundation for a different kind of humanity, for people who
will live out of awareness, who will be alert about what they are doing,
what they are thinking, who will be guided by their inner light.</p><p>That's a new birth, that is the meaning name. And it has to be
realised so it becomes a reality too, not only a name.</p><p>GOD ADORES A VACUUM</p><p>(Vinito means absolutely humble, Osho tells another swami.) But when
I use the word 'humble' I don't mean something against the ego, I mean
the absence of the ego.</p><p>If something is against the ego then it still carries some
relationship to the ego. Maybe the ego is standing upside-down so it
looks opposite, but the ego is there.</p><p>Whenever a person cultivates humbleness he becomes proud of his
humbleness -</p><p>- that is ego coming in from the backdoor. He becomes very egoistic
in a subtle way; his ego is not gross, it is very saintly, holy,
holier-than-thou, but it is still ego.</p><p>When I use the word 'humble' I don't mean the opposite of ego but the
absence of the ego -- and there is a tremendous difference. The absence
of the ego is the absence of all kinds of ego. The holy ego, the
spiritual ego, are all rejected. One is not even proud of one's
humbleness ... because that is a contradiction in terms. The ego is so
absent that one is not even conscious of one's humbleness. One is simply
humble, there is not even a self consciousness about it Then humbleness
is true and that humbleness becomes the opening to god.</p><p>God can descend in you when you are not, when you are absolutely non-
existential. When god is absolutely existential in you, within you, in
each cell of your being, in each fibre of your existence, then he
pulsates, he beats, he breathes; you are simply no more.</p><p>Become a zero and you become the abode of god. My sannyasins have to
be zeroes, just zeroes.</p><p>WAIT WATCHER</p><p>(Sudhir means utterly patient, capable of waiting infinitely, Osho
tells Ma Sudhir.) It is one of the most significant qualities for a
seeker of truth, to be able to wait. It cannot be done in a hurried way,
you cannot have it instantly; it is not like instant coffee.</p><p>Truth cannot be achieved through the American way of life. Maybe it
is because of this that this country is so lazy and lousy but it has
created the greatest number of Buddhas in the world. That laziness and
lousiness may be the cause of it all (laughter)... because people can
wait, people are patient, nobody is in a hurry. If somebody says 'I will
come to see you today,' even if he comes within the week he is perfectly
in time! (laughter) Nobody will object about what you said and that now
one week has passed. That is not even mentioned, nobody takes any notice
of it.</p><p>People are moving with a very slow speed, at snail's speed. There is
no hurry to reach anywhere. When you are in a hurry you cannot enjoy the
journey; you are focussed on the goal. And when you are not in a hurry
you can enjoy the sideshows and the sight-seeings and sometimes you can
go on a side-path and enjoy a waterfall or a river and have a swim and
forget all about the goal. You can go astray, it is allowed. The journey
in itself is so beautiful that who bothers about the goal? And what is
the hurry? -- life is eternal so some day we are bound to reach. How
long can we go on missing?</p><p>It is said about Diogenes, a Greek mystic, that he went to see a show
-- an archer was giving a show. He was so lousy that not even a single
arrow reached the target. Diogenes went and sat by the side of the
target.</p><p>The crowd said 'What are you doing?' He said 'This is the safest
place! This man can shoot anywhere, but this is the safest places his
arrows are not going to reach</p><p>here.' 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-4>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>Life should be taken more joyously, more cheerfully, less seriously.
Certainly truth has to be enquired into but not in a hurried way. And
then a miracle happens: the less you are in a hurry, the quicker it
happens. If you are ready to wait for infinity it can happen instantly,
because the very capacity to wait shows your trust. The very capacity to
wait shows your surrender; it shows that you know it is going to happen
sooner or later and you are not trying to force it in any way to happen
right now.</p><p>You are allowing existence to take its own time. When spring comes
the flowers will blossom.</p><p>That is the meaning of Sudhirs learn to wait for the spring. It
always comes. This is trust, that it always comes. If it came to Buddha,
to Jesus, to Zarathustra, why not to you?</p><p>Once this attitude settles you become relaxed, calm and quiet. And in
that calmness and quietness, in that relaxed state, it can come. It can
come right now</p><p>(There is a smile in Osho's voice as he asks)</p><p>-- How long will you be here?</p><p>(She shrugs her shoulders, the very picture of total relaxation. The
group laughs and Osho chuckles.)</p><p>-- That's right. Good, Sudhir, good! BLISS IS IT</p><p>Pleasure is very momentary, it exists only for a split second.
Happiness is a little</p><p>longer, joy even a little longer, more suffused, but they are both
part of time. Pleasure, happiness, joy -- they are all part of time, and
anything that is part of time is bound to come and go, it cannot be
forever.</p><p>Time means change, time means flux, movement. Nothing can be static
in time, nothing can be at a standstill. But bliss is eternal, hence it
is not part of time, it is beyond time. And to attain to bliss one has
to go beyond time.</p><p>When I say one has to go beyond time the task seems to be impossible,
how can one go beyond time? --</p><p>because as far as physics or science is concerned there is no
possibility of going beyond time and space because the whole existence
consists only of time and is only a fourth dimension of space, so you
cannot go beyond it -- according to science. But according to the
awakened ones you can go beyond time because in fact you <em>are</em>
beyond time; you just have to search within yourself for a point which
is already beyond time.</p><p>Looked at in that light things have a different perspective: mind
becomes equivalent to time. Mind is a flux, constantly changing. Just
behind the mind is your awareness, which is the same, always the
same.</p><p>When you were a child it was the same, you became a young man, it was
the same, when you become old it will be the same. When you were in the
womb of your mother it was the same, when you were not born it was the
same, when you are dying it will be the same, when you are dead it will
be the same. There will be no difference at all, it is always the same.
It is the centre of the cyclone. The mind is like the cyclone and
awareness is the centre,,it is in the centre and yet beyond, it is
within and yet beyond.</p><p>This is the whole work of meditation, this is the commitment of
sannyas to search for that which is already beyond time. And the moment
you know it, the moment you taste it, you know that life is immortal,
you are immortal. There has never been any birth and there has never
been any death, all that has happened only on the circumference. At the
centre you have remained untouched.</p><p>This experience is the experience of god or nirvana, enlightenment --
or whatsoever one wants to call it.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=going-all-the-way>Going All the Way</h3><p>Chapter #27</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part25>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

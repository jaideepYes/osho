It is for reference purposes only.]\nBLISSOLUTION\n(Osho talks about the different reflections of bliss that we know as pleasure, happiness and joy.) It is just as you see your face in the mirror. The face in the mirror is a reflection of your original face but it is not your face. Joy is the reflection of bliss in the mirror of the mind. When you close your eyes to the mirror, you experience your original face. And that's the search of all religion, the search for the original face.\nThe Zen masters say one has to find the face that belonged to you before you were born or even before your parents were born. And there are layers and layers which have gathered upon the original face.\nThe most superficial layer is of pleasure. So whenever a society, a culture, remains obsessed with pleasure it remains childish; it is playing with toys. It cannot have anything of real meaning. Sooner or later it will feel the emptiness, the hollowness of it -- because toys can keep you engaged for a time but not forever. And it is good that they cannot keep you occupied forever, otherwise there would be no possibility of becoming a Christ or a Buddha.\nToys have to be broken, have to be shattered. One has to get rid of them, but nobody can get rid of toys in an immature way. It has to be a realisation that they are futile.\nThe people who have broken all the toys enter a deeper realm, the realm of happiness. Then they start becoming aware of the beauty of existence -- the sunrise, the sunset, the stars and the immense harmony that exists in the universe, the celestial music... what Heraclitus calls the hidden harmony.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nTo feel that hidden harmony through any aspect brings happiness. One can feel it through painting, one can feel it through music, poetry, sculpture. But modern man has lost that dimension almost totally. We have started worshipping ugliness instead of beauty. It is a sad thing, unfortunate, but in a way indicative. It indicates a failure of nerve.\nThe paintings of Picasso, and the paintings of the ancient masters, of Michelangelo and Leonardo Da Vinci, are so totally different that they seem to be unbridgeable. Leonardo or Michelangelo give you a sense of harmony, accord. Looking at their sculpture or painting, their pieces of art, you will feel as if you are surrounded by something which can only be called the song of silence. A grace will descend on you, a kind of meditativeness. The mind will stop for a moment.\nLooking at the paintings of Picasso or Dali one feels like going crazy, one would like to commit murder or suicide. One cannot meditate on the paintings of Picasso. If one does one is bound to become sick, sick to death.\nThe paintings of Picasso are basically not works of art but works of pathology. He is full of insanity and this is his way of getting rid of it, by painting it he gets rid of it. It is good for him, as far as he himself is concerned it is cathartic. It is a kind of throwing up or something that is making you feel nauseous, once you have thrown it out you feel good, there is a certain well-being.\nIf Picasso had been prevented from painting he would have committed suicide or would have committed murder or would have gone mad -- these were the only three alternatives left for him. Painting was good for him as a psychoanalytical method.\nThey use it now in psychoanalysis: mad people are told to paint -- and it helps. Just by painting they can throw much garbage out of themselves. They are told to write and they write poetry and novels. Just by writing they become a little saner because that which was torturing them inside is thrown out; they feel unburdened.\nThis is a pathological state.\nHappiness cannot arise out of modern art. It has lost that quality, it has even fallen from giving happiness to people. And the same is true about modern poetry, modern music. And not only man but even plants give their judgement.\nIn one Canadian university they were experimenting with music. To a few plants Ravi Shankar's sitar was played, and to others of the same kind, of the same height, in every way the same, jazz music, pop music. A strange thing happened: the plants that heard Ravi Shankar's sitar -- taped music -- all started leaning towards the tape-recorder, like a person who is hard of hearing and wants to listen more closely and puts his hand to his ear and comes closer. And the other plants started moving away from the jazz music and the pop music... to avoid it, somehow to escape. They could not escape because they were rooted in the ground, imprisoned, but at least they could move away a little.\nAnd the plants that were listening to Ravi Shankar's sitar grew faster. In the same time they became double the size of the other plants and they produced bigger flowers than the other plants.\nHappiness is the experience of harmony in existence, but it is passive, you are just receptive. Joy is active, not passive. Happiness is a woman, joy is a man. Joy dances, sings, participates, creates; happiness only receives, welcomes. Happiness is a host, but joy is the process of participation in the ultimate harmony of things. But still all these three are far away from bliss.\nBliss is becoming one with the harmony, not even participating. It is neither male nor female. It is just dissolving into the whole and dissolving forever. It is the point of no-return -- and that is the ultimate goal of sannyas.\nON THE WINGS OF WISDOM\n(There is a difference between knowledge and wisdom; Osho elucidates.) Knowledge is very ordinary -- you can gather it from all kinds of sources. There are libraries, there are museums, there are universities; they all deal in knowledge, their whole function is to inform people. They function as agents of the past. That's why the teacher has been respected in all the traditions over the world without any exception -- he helps the new generation to be conditioned according to the old.\nHe may not even be aware of what he is doing, but consciously or unconsciously he is part of a great conspiracy. The conspiracy starts before the children start thinking on their own -- that process has to be stopped. They have to be stuffed with knowledge, so much so that there is no more space left for them to 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- think.\nBefore they ask questions we have to give them answers. That is a way of destroying the questions, it is a kind of abortion. And unless a person starts questioning authentically, sincerely, totally, all his answers are borrowed. In fact he never asked them so they have been painted on, just like labels glued onto the surface. And that is the whole work that the so-called system of education goes on doing in the world.\nThe function of a master is not the function of a teacher, it is just the opposite: the teacher informs, the master transforms. The teacher gives you information, knowledge; he functions as an agent of the past. The master takes away all your knowledge, all your information. He gives you nothing, he simply leaves you absolutely as you are in your utter purity, in your innocence, in your unconditioned state of consciousness.\nSocrates is right when he says that the master's function is that of a midwife: he helps you to come out of the psychological womb that the teachers have created around you. Once you are out of the psychological womb you are a free person,\nthen you can explore, then you can enquire. And out of your enquiry, out of your own exploration, whatsoever knowing happens is wisdom.\nThe questions are yours, the answers also have to be yours. If the questions are yours and the answers are somebody else's, that is not going to help -- those answers are false.\nSo remember this: here you are to be unburdened of all knowledge so that your own wisdom, your own insight, can start welling up.\nThat is the true meaning of the word 'education'. It literally means to bring out that which is in. It is like drawing water from a well. That is education, drawing out. The water is already in, you drop a bucket down and you take the water out. But the education that exists in the world is not education, it is miseducation, because you are not bringing out that which is in; on the contrary, you are stuffing in that which is out, throwing inside the person's mind and body and just somehow making him swallow, whatsoever nonsense others have decided should be swallowed by every child.\nOthers are the deciders, the child has no part in it. He is helpless and he does not know what else to do; he cannot rebel, he cannot escape. And because of his helplessness we have done immense harm. Children are the most exploited class, far more exploited than the proletariat and women. And it seems almost impossible to bring them out of this deep deep-rooted exploitation -- because the parents are powerful, the society is powerful, the church is powerful, the state is power, d the child has no power at all; he has to depend on them for his survival. To survive he has to pay this cost: he has to sell his soul.\nSannyas means an effort to reclaim your soul, effort to destroy all that has been forced on you when you were helpless. Now you are no more helpless, now there is no need to carry it even for a single moment. It all has to be dropped. And the moment we drop all knowledge a great freedom, a great joy, a great weightlessness, happens. Suddenly you start growing wings, you can fly to the very end of the sky --\nnothing can hold you back. YOU WON'T FEEL A THING\n(... once society has conditioned you. We have to reclaim the sensitivity we had\nas children, Osho tells us.)\nThe conditioning of all the cultures is to make everybody insensitive, dull, numb, because sensitivity can be a trouble. To allow people to be sensitive is dangerous. If they are sensitive to beauty then marriage will be on the rocks. If marriage is to be saved then you have to destroy their sensitivity for beauty. Because who knows? -- tomorrow you may meet a woman who suddenly catches your whole being, who makes you afire.\nThen there is no protection.\nThe only way society can control you is to make your skin as thick as possible, so nothing penetrates you. And it is not only a question of a beautiful woman or man, because beauty is the same. Whether you are experiencing a beautiful sunset or a beautiful flower or a beautiful waterfall, or a beautiful cloud, it is the same beauty. You have to be crippled and paralysed so that you cannot experience beauty -- then marriage is safe. And marriage is the foundation of our so-called groat society. Marriage functions as the basic unit and it is the ugliest institution man has invented so far.\nThey say love is blind. They also say marriage is an institution. Then I say marriage is an institution for the blind. They make the institution, then they make you blind because the institution needs people, otherwise all the functionaries of the institution will be jobless; they need some work to do. And there are people who have become experts in blinding you -- they need jobs. The whole society is functioning in such 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\na way that it is basically against sensitivity.\nA sensitive person would prefer to die than to become a slave, because slavery is possible only if you are so dull that you don't feel the humiliation at all. And the society needs slaves, all kinds of slaves; from the peon to the president, all kinds of slaves are needed.\nThe only guarantee for having so many slaves is to destroy peoples' capacity to feel, to be aware, to see.\nTheir whole clarity has to be messed up so they cannot see, they cannot feel. Then naturally they go on accepting any kind of state, just to survive they go on accepting all kinds of humiliations. They are ready to exist below the human level. Millions of people are existing below the human level, just like dogs, or maybe even dogs are living in a better way.\nThe sensitive person is bound to be rebellious because wherever he sees anything unjust he will revolt, he will not be able to tolerate it. There is so much injustice everywhere. How to protect this injustice and the structure that depends on it and all the investments. Society has found a very sure and certain ways -- that is, from the very beginning start making the child a numskull. It is a kind of anaesthesia, psychological chloroform, so one only lives at the minimum; and only then can this whole exploitative establishment continue. The priest, the politicians, the pedagogues -- they can all go on exploiting people. And they themselves are in the same boat.\nIt is a very strange society. We are standing in a circle: everybody's hand in somebody's pocket; one person is searching in somebody else's pocket, somebody else is searching in his pocket... and so on and so forth. We are all standing in a circle, and everybody is happy because one is not aware of what the other is doing to him and the other is completely unaware of what is being done to him!\nThis whole stupidity has to be destroyed -- it is time. It has existed beyond its limit. Now it is just a mountainous weight on the human heart. It is crippling, destroying; it is like a cancer that goes on growing.\nMy sannyasins have to learn how to be sensitive again like small children -- alert, watchful, available, capable of feeling wonder and awe.\nI am not much interested in god, because if you are sensitive you will find him. So that is not the problem at all, the problem is: are you sensitive enough? Are you sensitive enough to find love? Are you sensitive enough to be a rebel. Are you sensitive enough to go against the mob psychology? If that is there then there is no question of bothering about God; you are bound to find him. But that happens only when one's sensitivity rises to a peak and one functions at the\nmaximum.\nGod is the experience of being sensitive at the optimum point. WITNESSING IS THE WINDOW TO GOD\n(Osho explains Haridarshan means god realisation.)\nGod is within us as a seed so we have not to go anywhere else to find him. No church, no temple, no mosque, is going to help, no scripture is going to become a guarantee. The whole thing is so simple that if you can look within all becomes possible. So I don't teach many things here, just one single thing but it is a master key, it can unlock all the doors within you. I call it witnessing.\nLearn to observe three things: First, your body and its actions Walking,\nremember that you are walking; eating, remember that you are eating; falling into sleep, remember for as long as you can, that you are falling asleep. Secondly, be watchful of your mind and its mechanism. Watch the thoughts, the memories, the desires, without any evaluation, as if they don't belong to you, as if you are just reading a novel or seeing a movie -- unconcerned, cool, detached. And thirdly, watch your feelings, your emotions, your moods, knowing perfectly well that I am the watcher and the watcher can never be the watched. I am the subject and they are the object. I am the seer and they are the seen.\nYou have to do these three things. In fact there is only one thing -- watching witnessing, but it has to be practised on three planes. And then one day when all these three have come to a certain ripeness the fourth, witnessing, happens of its own accord. Then the witness becomes a witness of itself, then consciousness comes to know itself. That's what Socrates means when he says know thyself. Knowing oneself means witnessing one's ultimate nature. And that is the door to the divine. From there god possesses you.\nThat is the meaning of your name, Haridarshan: the vision of god, the experience of god, the realisation of god.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nGoing All the Way Chapter #10\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2928","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/going_all_the_way/part9/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/going_all_the_way/>Going All The Way</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>14 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2928 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Going_All_The_Way/part9.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part8>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

their judgement.</p><p>In one Canadian university they were experimenting with music. To a
few plants Ravi Shankar's sitar was played, and to others of the same
kind, of the same height, in every way the same, jazz music, pop music.
A strange thing happened: the plants that heard Ravi Shankar's sitar --
taped music -- all started leaning towards the tape-recorder, like a
person who is hard of hearing and wants to listen more closely and puts
his hand to his ear and comes closer. And the other plants started
moving away from the jazz music and the pop music... to avoid it,
somehow to escape. They could not escape because they were rooted in the
ground, imprisoned, but at least they could move away a little.</p><p>And the plants that were listening to Ravi Shankar's sitar grew
faster. In the same time they became double the size of the other plants
and they produced bigger flowers than the other plants.</p><p>Happiness is the experience of harmony in existence, but it is
passive, you are just receptive. Joy is active, not passive. Happiness
is a woman, joy is a man. Joy dances, sings, participates, creates;
happiness only receives, welcomes. Happiness is a host, but joy is the
process of participation in the ultimate harmony of things. But still
all these three are far away from bliss.</p><p>Bliss is becoming one with the harmony, not even participating. It is
neither male nor female. It is just dissolving into the whole and
dissolving forever. It is the point of no-return -- and that is the
ultimate goal of sannyas.</p><p>ON THE WINGS OF WISDOM</p><p>(There is a difference between knowledge and wisdom; Osho
elucidates.) Knowledge is very ordinary -- you can gather it from all
kinds of sources. There are libraries, there are museums, there are
universities; they all deal in knowledge, their whole function is to
inform people. They function as agents of the past. That's why the
teacher has been respected in all the traditions over the world without
any exception -- he helps the new generation to be conditioned according
to the old.</p><p>He may not even be aware of what he is doing, but consciously or
unconsciously he is part of a great conspiracy. The conspiracy starts
before the children start thinking on their own -- that process has to
be stopped. They have to be stuffed with knowledge, so much so that
there is no more space left for them to 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on

of destroying the questions, it is a kind of abortion. And unless a
person starts questioning authentically, sincerely, totally, all his
answers are borrowed. In fact he never asked them so they have been
painted on, just like labels glued onto the surface. And that is the
whole work that the so-called system of education goes on doing in the
world.</p><p>The function of a master is not the function of a teacher, it is just
the opposite: the teacher informs, the master transforms. The teacher
gives you information, knowledge; he functions as an agent of the past.
The master takes away all your knowledge, all your information. He gives
you nothing, he simply leaves you absolutely as you are in your utter
purity, in your innocence, in your unconditioned state of
consciousness.</p><p>Socrates is right when he says that the master's function is that of
a midwife: he helps you to come out of the psychological womb that the
teachers have created around you. Once you are out of the psychological
womb you are a free person,</p><p>then you can explore, then you can enquire. And out of your enquiry,
out of your own exploration, whatsoever knowing happens is wisdom.</p><p>The questions are yours, the answers also have to be yours. If the
questions are yours and the answers are somebody else's, that is not
going to help -- those answers are false.</p><p>So remember this: here you are to be unburdened of all knowledge so
that your own wisdom, your own insight, can start welling up.</p><p>That is the true meaning of the word 'education'. It literally means
to bring out that which is in. It is like drawing water from a well.
That is education, drawing out. The water is already in, you drop a
bucket down and you take the water out. But the education that exists in
the world is not education, it is miseducation, because you are not
bringing out that which is in; on the contrary, you are stuffing in that
which is out, throwing inside the person's mind and body and just
somehow making him swallow, whatsoever nonsense others have decided
should be swallowed by every child.</p><p>Others are the deciders, the child has no part in it. He is helpless
and he does not know what else to do; he cannot rebel, he cannot escape.
And because of his helplessness we have done immense harm. Children are
the most exploited class, far more exploited than the proletariat and
women. And it seems almost impossible to bring them out of this deep
deep-rooted exploitation -- because the parents are powerful, the
society is powerful, the church is powerful, the state is power, d the
child has no power at all; he has to depend on them for his survival. To
survive he has to pay this cost: he has to sell his soul.</p><p>Sannyas means an effort to reclaim your soul, effort to destroy all
that has been forced on you when you were helpless. Now you are no more
helpless, now there is no need to carry it even for a single moment. It
all has to be dropped. And the moment we drop all knowledge a great
freedom, a great joy, a great weightlessness, happens. Suddenly you
start growing wings, you can fly to the very end of the sky --</p><p>nothing can hold you back. YOU WON'T FEEL A THING</p><p>(... once society has conditioned you. We have to reclaim the
sensitivity we had</p><p>as children, Osho tells us.)</p><p>The conditioning of all the cultures is to make everybody
insensitive, dull, numb, because sensitivity can be a trouble. To allow
people to be sensitive is dangerous. If they are sensitive to beauty
then marriage will be on the rocks. If marriage is to be saved then you
have to destroy their sensitivity for beauty. Because who knows? --
tomorrow you may meet a woman who suddenly catches your whole being, who
makes you afire.</p><p>Then there is no protection.</p><p>The only way society can control you is to make your skin as thick as
possible, so nothing penetrates you. And it is not only a question of a
beautiful woman or man, because beauty is the same. Whether you are
experiencing a beautiful sunset or a beautiful flower or a beautiful
waterfall, or a beautiful cloud, it is the same beauty. You have to be
crippled and paralysed so that you cannot experience beauty -- then
marriage is safe. And marriage is the foundation of our so-called groat
society. Marriage functions as the basic unit and it is the ugliest
institution man has invented so far.</p><p>They say love is blind. They also say marriage is an institution.
Then I say marriage is an institution for the blind. They make the
institution, then they make you blind because the institution needs
people, otherwise all the functionaries of the institution will be
jobless; they need some work to do. And there are people who have become
experts in blinding you -- they need jobs. The whole society is
functioning in such 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

because slavery is possible only if you are so dull that you don't feel
the humiliation at all. And the society needs slaves, all kinds of
slaves; from the peon to the president, all kinds of slaves are
needed.</p><p>The only guarantee for having so many slaves is to destroy peoples'
capacity to feel, to be aware, to see.</p><p>Their whole clarity has to be messed up so they cannot see, they
cannot feel. Then naturally they go on accepting any kind of state, just
to survive they go on accepting all kinds of humiliations. They are
ready to exist below the human level. Millions of people are existing
below the human level, just like dogs, or maybe even dogs are living in
a better way.</p><p>The sensitive person is bound to be rebellious because wherever he
sees anything unjust he will revolt, he will not be able to tolerate it.
There is so much injustice everywhere. How to protect this injustice and
the structure that depends on it and all the investments. Society has
found a very sure and certain ways -- that is, from the very beginning
start making the child a numskull. It is a kind of anaesthesia,
psychological chloroform, so one only lives at the minimum; and only
then can this whole exploitative establishment continue. The priest, the
politicians, the pedagogues -- they can all go on exploiting people. And
they themselves are in the same boat.</p><p>It is a very strange society. We are standing in a circle:
everybody's hand in somebody's pocket; one person is searching in
somebody else's pocket, somebody else is searching in his pocket... and
so on and so forth. We are all standing in a circle, and everybody is
happy because one is not aware of what the other is doing to him and the
other is completely unaware of what is being done to him!</p><p>This whole stupidity has to be destroyed -- it is time. It has
existed beyond its limit. Now it is just a mountainous weight on the
human heart. It is crippling, destroying; it is like a cancer that goes
on growing.</p><p>My sannyasins have to learn how to be sensitive again like small
children -- alert, watchful, available, capable of feeling wonder and
awe.</p><p>I am not much interested in god, because if you are sensitive you
will find him. So that is not the problem at all, the problem is: are
you sensitive enough? Are you sensitive enough to find love? Are you
sensitive enough to be a rebel. Are you sensitive enough to go against
the mob psychology? If that is there then there is no question of
bothering about God; you are bound to find him. But that happens only
when one's sensitivity rises to a peak and one functions at the</p><p>maximum.</p><p>God is the experience of being sensitive at the optimum point.
WITNESSING IS THE WINDOW TO GOD</p><p>(Osho explains Haridarshan means god realisation.)</p><p>God is within us as a seed so we have not to go anywhere else to find
him. No church, no temple, no mosque, is going to help, no scripture is
going to become a guarantee. The whole thing is so simple that if you
can look within all becomes possible. So I don't teach many things here,
just one single thing but it is a master key, it can unlock all the
doors within you. I call it witnessing.</p><p>Learn to observe three things: First, your body and its actions
Walking,</p><p>remember that you are walking; eating, remember that you are eating;
falling into sleep, remember for as long as you can, that you are
falling asleep. Secondly, be watchful of your mind and its mechanism.
Watch the thoughts, the memories, the desires, without any evaluation,
as if they don't belong to you, as if you are just reading a novel or
seeing a movie -- unconcerned, cool, detached. And thirdly, watch your
feelings, your emotions, your moods, knowing perfectly well that I am
the watcher and the watcher can never be the watched. I am the subject
and they are the object. I am the seer and they are the seen.</p><p>You have to do these three things. In fact there is only one thing --
watching witnessing, but it has to be practised on three planes. And
then one day when all these three have come to a certain ripeness the
fourth, witnessing, happens of its own accord. Then the witness becomes
a witness of itself, then consciousness comes to know itself. That's
what Socrates means when he says know thyself. Knowing oneself means
witnessing one's ultimate nature. And that is the door to the divine.
From there god possesses you.</p><p>That is the meaning of your name, Haridarshan: the vision of god, the
experience of god, the realisation of god.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on

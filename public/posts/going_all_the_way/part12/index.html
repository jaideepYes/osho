It is for reference purposes only.]\nUNBEARABLE BLISS\n(Swami Anand Bernd's journey is from bear to bliss, Osho tells a German sannyasin.) The religion of man has passed through many stages. The most intense stage was when man was worshipping animals. The second stage was when man started worshipping images of god, statues. And the third and the highest stage has been achieved only by a very few people -- worshipping consciousness.\nTo worship an animal is to worship life. Animal, the very word, comes from anima: anima means life. It is good to worship life but life is not enough, something more is needed. The animal is unconscious; life is there but unaware of itself.\nThen man started worshipping statues of Krishna, Christ, Buddha. It is a little better in a way because these statues represent something of consciousness, but because they are images they have to be made out of matter.\nThe third stage, the highest, is the worship of pure consciousness -- no image, no idol, no object of worship, but just a worshipfulness, a prayerfulness. Unless you\nunderstand this you will not be able to understand the meaning of your name.\nAnand means bliss. That is the highest experience of consciousness, there is nothing higher than that.\nWhen consciousness comes to its peak, ultimate peak, bliss explodes. So bliss represents the crescendo of consciousness.\nBernd means bear. In Germany the bear was worshipped as the sacred father, just as in India people worship the cow as the sacred mother. Between the Germans and the Indians good marriages can happen, they have the sacred father and these people have the sacred mother. And the meeting of the sacred father and the sacred mother can really... it can bring something new into existence! (laughter) With all the stupidity of the Indian mind and with all the efficiency of the German mind... And when a stupid person is efficient (peals of laughter) it is better if he remains lousy and lazy.\nSo your name represents both: the first, the beginning of religion -- the sacred father, the bear, and the sacred mother, the cow -- and the last, the ultimate too, bliss. When consciousness becomes Christ --\nconsciousness or Buddha-consciousness you have to leave those sacred cows and bears back far behind.\nOne has to move from life to conscious life.\nWhen life becomes consciousness it is a dance a celebration, a festival -- and that is the goal of sannyas: from bear to bliss!\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nMOLE OR MOTH\n(Most of us stumble about in the darkness of unconsciousness, while just a few\nare attracted to the light and consumed by consciousness.)\nMan lives in darkness, his inner sun has not yet risen. The dawn has not come, it is still night. Yes, the dawn has opened to a few people but to so few people that it almost appears as if all those people are fictitious. In millions of people one person becomes a Buddha. The phenomenon is so exceptional that it is unbelievable. That's why people have not yet really been able to trust Buddhas, Christs and Zarathustras.\nThey have paid them formal respect but deep down there is doubt. It is impossible for them to believe a man whose unconsciousness has completely disappeared because it is not their own experience.\nThey are not at fault, they cannot be condemned for this. I can understand their problem. The problem is that a man can understand only that which has happened to him. If it has not happened to you how can you understand? You can hear the word but the word will remain meaningless.\nMy sannyasins are not believers, they are seekers, inquirers, explorers. And the goal of the search is light, consciousness; the whole unconscious from the inside has to be dropped -- and it is possible. And when your inner life is full of light it is a totally different life. From the outside everything seems to be the same but from the inside nothing is the same any more. It is a new birth.\nCONSTANT MOTION OR RELAX-OCEAN\n(Take it e-sea and god will take you over.)\nOne of the qualities that has disappeared from the modern man is patience. He is in too much of a hurry, so much so that he cannot enjoy anything. While he is eating he is thinking of something else; he is in a rush. And when he reaches that place which he was thinking about while eating he will be thinking of something else; maybe imagining the next meal. And so on and so forth it goes on and on. One is never where one is. It is a continuous run. Even in their dreams people are running, chasing something.\nTwo lazy people were lying down in the sun under a tree and one said to the other 'I am feeling so --\ntired today.' The other said 'Tired? But why should you be tired? -- you have not\ndone anything.' He said\n'Not really, but in my dreams a tiger was chasing me and I was running so fast that I am still feeling tired.'\nTn fact even running in your dream will make you feel tired. It is not a joke, it is a truth. There are method, in which you can do exercises just by visualising. Close your eyes and go for a run on the beach: the sun is hot and you are perspiring and the air is salty. The whole scene has to be visualised as concretely as possible. You are huffing and puffing... And after half an hour open your eyes and you will see perspiration on your face and your breathing will be different -- you have done good exercise.\nIn fact if a person has the capacity to visualise there is no need to do any other exercise; just visualising will help. So in the day people are running, in the night people are running; in fact from the cradle to the grave they go on running. And one wonders where they are running to -- to the grave!\nThe moment they escape from the cradle they rush towards the grave! It seems as if they are in such a hurry to roach the place, and what are they going to do in their graves? -- they will turn and toss inside.\nA man was dying and his wife told him 'Remember, be faithful to me. I don't know about the other life.\nAnd the man said 'I will remain faithful but you also promise me that you will remain faithful -- because I know about this life, and whenever you do anything unfaithful to me I will turn in my grave.'\nAfter many years the woman died. The moment she reached the door of heaven she asked Saint Peter\n'Can I meet my husband who died twenty years ago? His name was John.' Saint Peter said 'But there are thousands of Johns here. Can you say something specific about him?' She said 'Only one thing, that when he died he told me that if I am ever unfaithful to him he will toss and turn in his grave.'\nPeter said 'Then don't be worried -- he is a well-known figure. People call him Whirling John. He is continuously whirling!'\nEven in the grave, even in the other world... But old habits don't die. People die, habits continue -- they have their own life and their own momentum.\nMy sannyasins have to learn to be relaxed, restful, not to be in a hurry, because there is nowhere to go.\nWe are already there, so what is the hurry? We have never been anywhere else. This is the place and this is the time. There is no other place and no other time. This contains my whole approach towards life: being 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nherenow. And then all impatience and hurry disappears, and with them disappear the anxieties, the tensions, the nightmares, the worries. The whole world of anguish disappears, and in that space of calm and quiet, rejoicing in the moment, what happens can be called god or nirvana.\nNURTURE VIRTUE\nMorality is not virtue. Morality is just conformity with the society in which you are born. Immorality is to go against the code of the society, morality is to follow it. Morality simply means obedience to the society and immorality means disobedience. In that sense Jesus is immoral, he disobeyed his society.\nSocrates is immoral, Buddha is immoral, Lao Tzu is immoral; in fact all the great people who have walked on the earth are immoral in that sense because they disobeyed, they were rebels. But they are virtuous. In fact they rebelled against the morality because they felt it was not virtuous.\nMorality comes from others and virtue is your inner understanding. Virtue comes through awareness.\nWhen you start seeing clearly then you know what is right and what is wrong. Nobody else can decide it for you. In fact even you cannot decide it forever because what is good this moment may not be good the next moment, what is wrong this moment may be right the next moment. So the virtuous person has no\nfixed character.\nFixed characters are only for the dull and the dead. The virtuous person is riverlike, flowing, moving, dynamic. He is flexible, he is always in tune with the situation. He has no prepared answers for the situation. He responds to the situation with his whole heart. His response is spontaneous, hence according to me, spontaneity and awareness are the two sides of real virtue.\nBe aware and be spontaneous, and then beware of one things your life will be a life of a rebel. But the rebel comes to know all that is ecstatic. Even if he has to suffer crucifixion, his life has a beauty of its own.\nAnd the moral person may be crowned, but he is just soulless, empty, hollow. LIFE'S NOT A SUM BUT A SYMPHONY\nMy approach towards everything is that of poetry, not of prose. It is of music, not of mathematics. It is of the mystic, not of the scientist. And these are two totally different approaches. They bring two totally different experiences.\nThe person who thinks in prose will be logical, mathematical, scientific, but he will miss something. He will be very efficient like a computer, like a beautiful machine, efficient, reliable, predictable, but he will not have life. There will be something dead inside him -- because life can happen only when you reach beyond the world of logic and calculation, when you allow the mysterious to enter you. That's what I mean by poetry: becoming vulnerable to the mysterious, being available to that which cannot be comprehended by intellect alone.\nPoetry is intuitive, not intellectual. It comes from deeper sources of your being and it is only through the poetic vision that one can feel the presence of god -- within and without -- both. And it is only through the poetic approach that one can have some sense of love, beauty, humour. And these are the real values.\nEfficiency is not a value, calculativeness is not a value. It can make a good businessman but it will not make you a real man, it will not give you authenticity\n-- and you will miss the splendour because the splendour is bigger than intellect. It needs a different door.\nThe man of logic cannot love because love seems illogical. The man of love has to put logic aside, he has to go into love in spite of all logic and its objections.\nA beautiful woman wanted to get married to Emmanuel Kant, one of the great German philosophers, but he was a total logician. He said 'I will have to think about it.' And whenever somebody says that about love, that he has to think about it, it is already over.\nFor three years he pondered over the matter, he looked into all the possible books from where he can get information about whether to marry or not to marry. He collected all the information, all the arguments for and against. Now, this is not a way to move into love. And after three years he decided to get married because there was one argument more in favour than against -- and that argument was that unless you experience something how can you decide? That's certainly a significant argument: first you have to experience, only then can you decide.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nHe knocked on the door of the woman, her father opened the door, and he asked about the girl. The father said 'You are a little bit late: she is already married and is a mother of two children.' Emmanuel Kant remained unmarried for the whole of his life.\nLogic is not possible for those who want a life of love. Those who want to move into the mysterious existence have to put the mind aside.\nLive poetry. That's what sannyas is all about, living poetry, not just composing it\n-- that is not of much value but living it, breathing it. GOD IS NOT A PEEPING TOM\n(... but man at his optimum)\nOne of the great Indian mystics, Chandidas has a very significant statement. I consider it to be one of the most significant statements ever made anywhere in the whole history of humanity. His statement is ' sabar oopar manus satya, tahar\noopar nahin': The truth of man is the highest truth and there is no truth higher than that.\nChandidas was a lover of Gautam Buddha. In this small statement he has condensed the whole philosophy of Buddha. That's what Buddha preached his whole life, that the truth of man is the highest truth. Don't look for any god above the clouds -- that is childish. Don't look for any god as a protector, as a father figure, sitting somewhere on a golden throne in heaven watching everybody, trying to detect something, spying on everybody. That is a very stupid idea. God is not a person somewhere else, it is the ultimate point of your inner growth. God is a discovery within man, it is man's truth.\nSo we have to search for god within, not without. And the only method to search for him is meditation.\nMeditation means going in, becoming a dropout for the time being from the outside world, forgetting it all, as if it does not exist any more.\nIf one can manage even a few small gap, of inner experience the whole life starts having a different colour and a different fragrance. Then even when you are in the outside world you are a totally different person because your consciousness is different. Then you function in a divine way.\nKILL TO CREATE\n(Osho talked about the balancing aspect of god on the eleventh; tonight he talks about Mahadeva who represents the destructive element.)\nMahadeva is called the great god. It is strange, but significant, because every creation is possible only through destruction. Destruction has to precede creation. Unless you demolish the old, you cannot make the new. And it is not only a metaphor about the cosmos, it is a metaphor about each individual's psychological growth too; first you have to destroy, you have to negate many things, you have to destroy the past-oriented mind and clinging with memories. All that is nothing but dust which has gathered on your consciousness, and if you cling to it you lose the quality of mirroring reality. It has to be removed.\nA sannyasin has to live in such a way that he dies to the past every moment, so no dust ever gathers and he is always fresh and in tune with reality, always reflecting that which is.\nI can see why these mystics have called the destructive aspect of god the great god. Ordinary logic will say call Brahma, who created the whole world, the great god, or call Vishnu who maintains the whole world, the great god. But calling Mahadeva, who one day simply destroys the whole world, the great god, looks illogical, but it only looks so; it has a psychological truth about it. He cleanses the whole world of all that is rotten, old, meaningless, junk; he cleanses the world of it all, so that again a new cosmos begins.\nAnd this is to be understood on an individual plane too; my sannyasins have to be very destructive, destructive in order to create. They have to destroy unconsciousness, only then will consciousness be created. They have to destroy all their identities with the body, the mind and the heart, only then will they come to know their eternity.\nDestruction is a way to discover that which is indestructible. 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nSING A SONG OF SILENCE\n(Osho spoke on the need to live a balanced life on the eleventh; tonight he reiterates that in reference to being alone and in love. The mind moves from one extreme to another, just like the pendulum of a clock, he said.)\nOne thing has to be understood, when the pendulum is moving to the left it is gathering momentum to go to the right, when it is going to the right it is gathering momentum to go to the left. That momentum is not visible but we can infer it easily.\nThe farther right it goes, the farther left it will go. And the mind is continuously doing this. One will cat too much, then one will diet or go on a fast or one may become a fanatic naturalist and may start believing in naturopathy. First one eats too much, then fasts and then soon one starts eating again. And this is the story of all the people who go on dieting they will lose a few pounds by dieting and\nthen they will jump to the other extreme one day and will start eating ice cream and everything. And they have missed it so much that they jump on it with a vengeance.\nThey may have lost only a few pounds in few weeks; they will gain more than that within days. And again, the misery, and again the desire to diet... This goes on, this vacillation, in everything.\nWhen you are with people you feel to be alone, to have your own space, uninterfered with -- just like a bird on the wing, the whole sky is yours. And when you are alone you are simply lonely, not alone. There is no sky, no bird on the wing, nothing -- you are just sitting, looking foolish to yourself. And there is the great desire to find somebody, to become engaged in something, to be occupied. The mind is rushing: what to do, what not to do, where to go, where not to go? Soon you will be somewhere and again you will fall in love and you will think of the beauty of aloneness; you will be alone and you will think of the beauty of love.\nThe sannyasin has to avoid these extremes.\nThere is the same extreme between bliss and silence. If you are silent you will feel that something is missing. Silence is there but there is no joy in it. There is no disturbance, but it is like the peace of the cemetery, the silence of a grave, -- no song, no laughter, no dance. And the desire will arise to rush into some dance, into some song, into some celebration. Yes, there you will fee cheerful -- but feverish, tired, exhausted, and suddenly there will be the desire for silence, to be left alone, to be with yourself, unoccupied.\nOne has to avoid both, and the best way to avoid both is to create a synthesis between both. Be silent and blissful together, be blissful and peaceful together, otherwise you cannot avoid that vacillation, because they are essential needs. If you deny one then sooner or later it will take its revenge. There should be no denial of anything. My sannyasins are not to deny anything. They have to listen to their needs and to find a balance, a synthesis. And the greatest synthesis is between silence and bliss.\nSo I teach both: I teach silence -- sitting silently, doing nothing -- and I also teach dance, music, singing, celebration, but in such a way that the silence still goes on like an undercurrent in you. You are dancing but the silence is there,\nundisturbed, unpolluted. And in fact that silence gives a depth to your dance. It is not against it, it gives a new dimension to it. And if you can dance with silence undisturbed, then you can be silent and there will be a subtle dance inside like an undercurrent, a joy running like a small stream. You can feel it, nobody will be able to see it but you can hear its whisper.\nWhen this happens then a man is both. I call that man Zorba the Buddha -- and that's my definition of a sannyasin.\nBuddha is silent, the Zorba part is missing. Zorba is cheerful, blissful, dancing, rejoicing, but the silent part is missing. Now the world has come to a point where we can create a man who is both, Zorba the Buddha. If my sannyasins can do it they will be introducing a totally new age in human consciousness, a new beginning, a new history. And it is immensely needed because man is fed up with the old pattern. It has done its work, it has become almost irrelevant; we have gone far beyond it. Now a new synthesis is the demand of the moment -- and I don't see it happening anywhere else, I don't see that it is even being tried anywhere.\nWhat is happening is that the Zorbas are tired of being Zorbas and they are trying to be Buddhas, and the Buddhas are tired of being Buddhas and they are trying to be Zorbas. That is the same game again -- it won't change anything. The West is turning East and the East is turning West. The West, particularly the most intelligent, the most young and alive people is coming to the East and the East, the most alive and intelligent people, is rushing towards Oxford Cambridge, Harvard, to learn more technology and more 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- science.\nBoth look at each other in a very strange way. The intelligent western person coming to the East cannot believe that the eastern intelligence is rushing towards the West, and the eastern person cannot believe why these western people are coming to the East. For what?\nRudyard Kipling wrote that the West is West and the East is East and the twain shall never meet. And when he wrote it he was perfectly right. What is happening is not going against Kipling; the West may become East, the East may become West and again they shall never meet again. It may remain the same thing; the labels change but the meeting does not happen.\nMy sannyasins may be the only people in the whole world where the meeting is happening, at least the basic groundwork is being done, the foundation is being laid. My whole effort is to try in every possible way to prove Rudyard Kipling wrong, absolutely wrong. He has to be proved wrong -- and that is possible only if Zorba the Buddha is born. And I am very hopeful that he will be born. The situation is ripe.

diary, which has been scanned and cleaned up. It is for reference

German sannyasin.) The religion of man has passed through many stages.
The most intense stage was when man was worshipping animals. The second
stage was when man started worshipping images of god, statues. And the
third and the highest stage has been achieved only by a very few people
-- worshipping consciousness.</p><p>To worship an animal is to worship life. Animal, the very word, comes
from anima: anima means life. It is good to worship life but life is not
enough, something more is needed. The animal is unconscious; life is
there but unaware of itself.</p><p>Then man started worshipping statues of Krishna, Christ, Buddha. It
is a little better in a way because these statues represent something of
consciousness, but because they are images they have to be made out of
matter.</p><p>The third stage, the highest, is the worship of pure consciousness --
no image, no idol, no object of worship, but just a worshipfulness, a
prayerfulness. Unless you</p><p>understand this you will not be able to understand the meaning of
your name.</p><p>Anand means bliss. That is the highest experience of consciousness,
there is nothing higher than that.</p><p>When consciousness comes to its peak, ultimate peak, bliss explodes.
So bliss represents the crescendo of consciousness.</p><p>Bernd means bear. In Germany the bear was worshipped as the sacred
father, just as in India people worship the cow as the sacred mother.
Between the Germans and the Indians good marriages can happen, they have
the sacred father and these people have the sacred mother. And the
meeting of the sacred father and the sacred mother can really... it can
bring something new into existence! (laughter) With all the stupidity of
the Indian mind and with all the efficiency of the German mind... And
when a stupid person is efficient (peals of laughter) it is better if he
remains lousy and lazy.</p><p>So your name represents both: the first, the beginning of religion --
the sacred father, the bear, and the sacred mother, the cow -- and the
last, the ultimate too, bliss. When consciousness becomes Christ --</p><p>consciousness or Buddha-consciousness you have to leave those sacred
cows and bears back far behind.</p><p>One has to move from life to conscious life.</p><p>When life becomes consciousness it is a dance a celebration, a
festival -- and that is the goal of sannyas: from bear to bliss!</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>MOLE OR MOTH</p><p>(Most of us stumble about in the darkness of unconsciousness, while
just a few</p><p>are attracted to the light and consumed by consciousness.)</p><p>Man lives in darkness, his inner sun has not yet risen. The dawn has
not come, it is still night. Yes, the dawn has opened to a few people
but to so few people that it almost appears as if all those people are
fictitious. In millions of people one person becomes a Buddha. The
phenomenon is so exceptional that it is unbelievable. That's why people
have not yet really been able to trust Buddhas, Christs and
Zarathustras.</p><p>They have paid them formal respect but deep down there is doubt. It
is impossible for them to believe a man whose unconsciousness has
completely disappeared because it is not their own experience.</p><p>They are not at fault, they cannot be condemned for this. I can
understand their problem. The problem is that a man can understand only
that which has happened to him. If it has not happened to you how can
you understand? You can hear the word but the word will remain
meaningless.</p><p>My sannyasins are not believers, they are seekers, inquirers,
explorers. And the goal of the search is light, consciousness; the whole
unconscious from the inside has to be dropped -- and it is possible. And
when your inner life is full of light it is a totally different life.
From the outside everything seems to be the same but from the inside
nothing is the same any more. It is a new birth.</p><p>CONSTANT MOTION OR RELAX-OCEAN</p><p>(Take it e-sea and god will take you over.)</p><p>One of the qualities that has disappeared from the modern man is
patience. He is in too much of a hurry, so much so that he cannot enjoy
anything. While he is eating he is thinking of something else; he is in
a rush. And when he reaches that place which he was thinking about while
eating he will be thinking of something else; maybe imagining the next
meal. And so on and so forth it goes on and on. One is never where one
is. It is a continuous run. Even in their dreams people are running,
chasing something.</p><p>Two lazy people were lying down in the sun under a tree and one said
to the other 'I am feeling so --</p><p>tired today.' The other said 'Tired? But why should you be tired? --
you have not</p><p>done anything.' He said</p><p>'Not really, but in my dreams a tiger was chasing me and I was
running so fast that I am still feeling tired.'</p><p>Tn fact even running in your dream will make you feel tired. It is
not a joke, it is a truth. There are method, in which you can do
exercises just by visualising. Close your eyes and go for a run on the
beach: the sun is hot and you are perspiring and the air is salty. The
whole scene has to be visualised as concretely as possible. You are
huffing and puffing... And after half an hour open your eyes and you
will see perspiration on your face and your breathing will be different
-- you have done good exercise.</p><p>In fact if a person has the capacity to visualise there is no need to
do any other exercise; just visualising will help. So in the day people
are running, in the night people are running; in fact from the cradle to
the grave they go on running. And one wonders where they are running to
-- to the grave!</p><p>The moment they escape from the cradle they rush towards the grave!
It seems as if they are in such a hurry to roach the place, and what are
they going to do in their graves? -- they will turn and toss inside.</p><p>A man was dying and his wife told him 'Remember, be faithful to me. I
don't know about the other life.</p><p>And the man said 'I will remain faithful but you also promise me that
you will remain faithful -- because I know about this life, and whenever
you do anything unfaithful to me I will turn in my grave.'</p><p>After many years the woman died. The moment she reached the door of
heaven she asked Saint Peter</p><p>'Can I meet my husband who died twenty years ago? His name was John.'
Saint Peter said 'But there are thousands of Johns here. Can you say
something specific about him?' She said 'Only one thing, that when he
died he told me that if I am ever unfaithful to him he will toss and
turn in his grave.'</p><p>Peter said 'Then don't be worried -- he is a well-known figure.
People call him Whirling John. He is continuously whirling!'</p><p>Even in the grave, even in the other world... But old habits don't
die. People die, habits continue -- they have their own life and their
own momentum.</p><p>My sannyasins have to learn to be relaxed, restful, not to be in a
hurry, because there is nowhere to go.</p><p>We are already there, so what is the hurry? We have never been
anywhere else. This is the place and this is the time. There is no other
place and no other time. This contains my whole approach towards life:
being 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>herenow. And then all impatience and hurry disappears, and with them
disappear the anxieties, the tensions, the nightmares, the worries. The
whole world of anguish disappears, and in that space of calm and quiet,
rejoicing in the moment, what happens can be called god or nirvana.</p><p>NURTURE VIRTUE</p><p>Morality is not virtue. Morality is just conformity with the society
in which you are born. Immorality is to go against the code of the
society, morality is to follow it. Morality simply means obedience to
the society and immorality means disobedience. In that sense Jesus is
immoral, he disobeyed his society.</p><p>Socrates is immoral, Buddha is immoral, Lao Tzu is immoral; in fact
all the great people who have walked on the earth are immoral in that
sense because they disobeyed, they were rebels. But they are virtuous.
In fact they rebelled against the morality because they felt it was not
virtuous.</p><p>Morality comes from others and virtue is your inner understanding.
Virtue comes through awareness.</p><p>When you start seeing clearly then you know what is right and what is
wrong. Nobody else can decide it for you. In fact even you cannot decide
it forever because what is good this moment may not be good the next
moment, what is wrong this moment may be right the next moment. So the
virtuous person has no</p><p>fixed character.</p><p>Fixed characters are only for the dull and the dead. The virtuous
person is riverlike, flowing, moving, dynamic. He is flexible, he is
always in tune with the situation. He has no prepared answers for the
situation. He responds to the situation with his whole heart. His
response is spontaneous, hence according to me, spontaneity and
awareness are the two sides of real virtue.</p><p>Be aware and be spontaneous, and then beware of one things your life
will be a life of a rebel. But the rebel comes to know all that is
ecstatic. Even if he has to suffer crucifixion, his life has a beauty of
its own.</p><p>And the moral person may be crowned, but he is just soulless, empty,
hollow. LIFE'S NOT A SUM BUT A SYMPHONY</p><p>My approach towards everything is that of poetry, not of prose. It is
of music, not of mathematics. It is of the mystic, not of the scientist.
And these are two totally different approaches. They bring two totally
different experiences.</p><p>The person who thinks in prose will be logical, mathematical,
scientific, but he will miss something. He will be very efficient like a
computer, like a beautiful machine, efficient, reliable, predictable,
but he will not have life. There will be something dead inside him --
because life can happen only when you reach beyond the world of logic
and calculation, when you allow the mysterious to enter you. That's what
I mean by poetry: becoming vulnerable to the mysterious, being available
to that which cannot be comprehended by intellect alone.</p><p>Poetry is intuitive, not intellectual. It comes from deeper sources
of your being and it is only through the poetic vision that one can feel
the presence of god -- within and without -- both. And it is only
through the poetic approach that one can have some sense of love,
beauty, humour. And these are the real values.</p><p>Efficiency is not a value, calculativeness is not a value. It can
make a good businessman but it will not make you a real man, it will not
give you authenticity</p><p>-- and you will miss the splendour because the splendour is bigger
than intellect. It needs a different door.</p><p>The man of logic cannot love because love seems illogical. The man of
love has to put logic aside, he has to go into love in spite of all
logic and its objections.</p><p>A beautiful woman wanted to get married to Emmanuel Kant, one of the
great German philosophers, but he was a total logician. He said 'I will
have to think about it.' And whenever somebody says that about love,
that he has to think about it, it is already over.</p><p>For three years he pondered over the matter, he looked into all the
possible books from where he can get information about whether to marry
or not to marry. He collected all the information, all the arguments for
and against. Now, this is not a way to move into love. And after three
years he decided to get married because there was one argument more in
favour than against -- and that argument was that unless you experience
something how can you decide? That's certainly a significant argument:
first you have to experience, only then can you decide.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>He knocked on the door of the woman, her father opened the door, and
he asked about the girl. The father said 'You are a little bit late: she
is already married and is a mother of two children.' Emmanuel Kant
remained unmarried for the whole of his life.</p><p>Logic is not possible for those who want a life of love. Those who
want to move into the mysterious existence have to put the mind
aside.</p><p>Live poetry. That's what sannyas is all about, living poetry, not
just composing it</p><p>-- that is not of much value but living it, breathing it. GOD IS NOT
A PEEPING TOM</p><p>(... but man at his optimum)</p><p>One of the great Indian mystics, Chandidas has a very significant
statement. I consider it to be one of the most significant statements
ever made anywhere in the whole history of humanity. His statement is '
<em>sabar oopar manus satya, tahar</em></p><p>oopar nahin<span class=p>': The truth of man is the highest truth
and there is no truth higher than that.</span></p><p>Chandidas was a lover of Gautam Buddha. In this small statement he
has condensed the whole philosophy of Buddha. That's what Buddha
preached his whole life, that the truth of man is the highest truth.
Don't look for any god above the clouds -- that is childish. Don't look
for any god as a protector, as a father figure, sitting somewhere on a
golden throne in heaven watching everybody, trying to detect something,
spying on everybody. That is a very stupid idea. God is not a person
somewhere else, it is the ultimate point of your inner growth. God is a
discovery within man, it is man's truth.</p><p>So we have to search for god within, not without. And the only method
to search for him is meditation.</p><p>Meditation means going in, becoming a dropout for the time being from
the outside world, forgetting it all, as if it does not exist any
more.</p><p>If one can manage even a few small gap, of inner experience the whole
life starts having a different colour and a different fragrance. Then
even when you are in the outside world you are a totally different
person because your consciousness is different. Then you function in a
divine way.</p><p>KILL TO CREATE</p><p>(Osho talked about the balancing aspect of god on the eleventh;
tonight he talks about Mahadeva who represents the destructive
element.)</p><p>Mahadeva is called the great god. It is strange, but significant,
because every creation is possible only through destruction. Destruction
has to precede creation. Unless you demolish the old, you cannot make
the new. And it is not only a metaphor about the cosmos, it is a
metaphor about each individual's psychological growth too; first you
have to destroy, you have to negate many things, you have to destroy the
past-oriented mind and clinging with memories. All that is nothing but
dust which has gathered on your consciousness, and if you cling to it
you lose the quality of mirroring reality. It has to be removed.</p><p>A sannyasin has to live in such a way that he dies to the past every
moment, so no dust ever gathers and he is always fresh and in tune with
reality, always reflecting that which is.</p><p>I can see why these mystics have called the destructive aspect of god
the great god. Ordinary logic will say call Brahma, who created the
whole world, the great god, or call Vishnu who maintains the whole
world, the great god. But calling Mahadeva, who one day simply destroys
the whole world, the great god, looks illogical, but it only looks so;
it has a psychological truth about it. He cleanses the whole world of
all that is rotten, old, meaningless, junk; he cleanses the world of it
all, so that again a new cosmos begins.</p><p>And this is to be understood on an individual plane too; my
sannyasins have to be very destructive, destructive in order to create.
They have to destroy unconsciousness, only then will consciousness be
created. They have to destroy all their identities with the body, the
mind and the heart, only then will they come to know their eternity.</p><p>Destruction is a way to discover that which is indestructible.
1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>SING A SONG OF SILENCE</p><p>(Osho spoke on the need to live a balanced life on the eleventh;
tonight he reiterates that in reference to being alone and in love. The
mind moves from one extreme to another, just like the pendulum of a
clock, he said.)</p><p>One thing has to be understood, when the pendulum is moving to the
left it is gathering momentum to go to the right, when it is going to
the right it is gathering momentum to go to the left. That momentum is
not visible but we can infer it easily.</p><p>The farther right it goes, the farther left it will go. And the mind
is continuously doing this. One will cat too much, then one will diet or
go on a fast or one may become a fanatic naturalist and may start
believing in naturopathy. First one eats too much, then fasts and then
soon one starts eating again. And this is the story of all the people
who go on dieting they will lose a few pounds by dieting and</p><p>then they will jump to the other extreme one day and will start
eating ice cream and everything. And they have missed it so much that
they jump on it with a vengeance.</p><p>They may have lost only a few pounds in few weeks; they will gain
more than that within days. And again, the misery, and again the desire
to diet... This goes on, this vacillation, in everything.</p><p>When you are with people you feel to be alone, to have your own
space, uninterfered with -- just like a bird on the wing, the whole sky
is yours. And when you are alone you are simply lonely, not alone. There
is no sky, no bird on the wing, nothing -- you are just sitting, looking
foolish to yourself. And there is the great desire to find somebody, to
become engaged in something, to be occupied. The mind is rushing: what
to do, what not to do, where to go, where not to go? Soon you will be
somewhere and again you will fall in love and you will think of the
beauty of aloneness; you will be alone and you will think of the beauty
of love.</p><p>The sannyasin has to avoid these extremes.</p><p>There is the same extreme between bliss and silence. If you are
silent you will feel that something is missing. Silence is there but
there is no joy in it. There is no disturbance, but it is like the peace
of the cemetery, the silence of a grave, -- no song, no laughter, no
dance. And the desire will arise to rush into some dance, into some
song, into some celebration. Yes, there you will fee cheerful -- but
feverish, tired, exhausted, and suddenly there will be the desire for
silence, to be left alone, to be with yourself, unoccupied.</p><p>One has to avoid both, and the best way to avoid both is to create a
synthesis between both. Be silent and blissful together, be blissful and
peaceful together, otherwise you cannot avoid that vacillation, because
they are essential needs. If you deny one then sooner or later it will
take its revenge. There should be no denial of anything. My sannyasins
are not to deny anything. They have to listen to their needs and to find
a balance, a synthesis. And the greatest synthesis is between silence
and bliss.</p><p>So I teach both: I teach silence -- sitting silently, doing nothing
-- and I also teach dance, music, singing, celebration, but in such a
way that the silence still goes on like an undercurrent in you. You are
dancing but the silence is there,</p><p>undisturbed, unpolluted. And in fact that silence gives a depth to
your dance. It is not against it, it gives a new dimension to it. And if
you can dance with silence undisturbed, then you can be silent and there
will be a subtle dance inside like an undercurrent, a joy running like a
small stream. You can feel it, nobody will be able to see it but you can
hear its whisper.</p><p>When this happens then a man is both. I call that man Zorba the
Buddha -- and that's my definition of a sannyasin.</p><p>Buddha is silent, the Zorba part is missing. Zorba is cheerful,
blissful, dancing, rejoicing, but the silent part is missing. Now the
world has come to a point where we can create a man who is both, Zorba
the Buddha. If my sannyasins can do it they will be introducing a
totally new age in human consciousness, a new beginning, a new history.
And it is immensely needed because man is fed up with the old pattern.
It has done its work, it has become almost irrelevant; we have gone far
beyond it. Now a new synthesis is the demand of the moment -- and I
don't see it happening anywhere else, I don't see that it is even being
tried anywhere.</p><p>What is happening is that the Zorbas are tired of being Zorbas and
they are trying to be Buddhas, and the Buddhas are tired of being
Buddhas and they are trying to be Zorbas. That is the same game again --
it won't change anything. The West is turning East and the East is
turning West. The West, particularly the most intelligent, the most
young and alive people is coming to the East and the East, the most
alive and intelligent people, is rushing towards Oxford Cambridge,
Harvard, to learn more technology and more 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-4>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:- science.</p><p>Both look at each other in a very strange way. The intelligent
western person coming to the East cannot believe that the eastern
intelligence is rushing towards the West, and the eastern person cannot
believe why these western people are coming to the East. For what?</p><p>Rudyard Kipling wrote that the West is West and the East is East and
the twain shall never meet. And when he wrote it he was perfectly right.
What is happening is not going against Kipling; the West may become
East, the East may become West and again they shall never meet again. It
may remain the same thing; the labels change but the meeting does not
happen.</p><p>My sannyasins may be the only people in the whole world where the
meeting is happening, at least the basic groundwork is being done, the
foundation is being laid. My whole effort is to try in every possible
way to prove Rudyard Kipling wrong, absolutely wrong. He has to be
proved wrong -- and that is possible only if Zorba the Buddha is born.
And I am very hopeful that he will be born. The situation is ripe. If he
cannot be born in this situation then he will never be born.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=going-all-the-way>Going All the Way</h3><p>Chapter #13</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part11>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

The rock represents hardness, the flower represents 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nsoftness. The rock represents destructiveness, the flower is creativity.\nEvery rock has to become a flower; every rock has the seed to become a flower, it has the potential. But one has to discover the flower, one has to remove the rock chunk by chunk so only the flower is left. The flower is the very centre of the rock. In fact the rock is not your enemy, it protects the flower until the time is ripe.\nSo one should not be against the rock but one should not cling to it either. Be\nthankful to it but now the moment has come to discard it. Now let it be something that is past, that is no more relevant, that will not have any meaning in the future. Now the future belongs to the flower. Think of yourself as being more like a flower with all its softness, vulnerability, delicateness, feminineness, receptivity.\nThe flower lives very momentarily, it is not stable. The rock is far more stable, it is almost permanent.\nThe flower is born in the morning and may be gone by the evening yet for those few moments that it lived it really lived. It danced in the wind, in the sun, in the rain -- it rejoiced.\nThe rock may be almost permanent but it is dead, it lives not. Durability has no value. Even a single moment of total aliveness is far more significant than being dead for the whole of eternity.\nSo let the rock be the past and the flower the future. PARIJAT IS THE NAME OF AN EASTERN FLOWER\nParijat is the name of an Eastern flower.\nFlowers represent many things. The one thing that is the most important of all those is the phenomenon of flowering, of opening.\nMan is also a flower, but closed like a bud. And unless we make a deliberate effort, unless we help, it won't open on its own. Society has created every kind of hindrance for its opening. Society is against the ultimate flowering of man because the moment a man flowers he becomes transcendental to all kinds of social formalities, structures, religions, nations, ideologies -- and everybody is afraid of that transcendence.\nThat means one has gone beyond all that you cherish and think of as very valuable.\nTo the transcendental consciousness all social morality is childish, stupid. Nations and politics are only for the mediocre, for the unintelligent; they are almost for the insane.\nIt has happened just now in America: the whole country has gone from choosing a peanut as president to choosing a big nut! And this goes on happening everywhere -- small nuts are replaced by bigger nuts. Only bigger nuts can replace them because only the bigger can push them out; otherwise they won't budge an inch.\nThe man who becomes transcendental is no longer a Hindu nor a Christian nor a Mohammedan, is neither German nor French nor Indian; he transcends all these limitations. That's why no society wants anybody to flower: people should remain mediocre, ungrown-up, because those ungrown-up people are always dependent on leaders, on priests, on popes, on imams and ayatollahs. They are always dependent on somebody. They have to be -- they need a father figure.\nThe ungrown-up person's mental age remains somewhere nearabout twelve or fourteen; he never goes beyond that. Millions of people die at the age of fourteen. That is their psychological age and that is the age of their death too. Then only the body goes on living but their soul remains absolutely dead, repetitive.\nSannyasins have to learn how to remove the barriers. And they can be easily removed, the only thing is that you have to become conscious of what the barriers are. They can easily be removed because you can just throw them away, nobody can prevent you. You can simply drop out of all \"isms,\" ideologies, churches.\nWho can prevent you? You can simply use nations for normal purposes -- the passport, the visa -- otherwise deep down you can be free. You need not be a German or an Italian, just to be human is enough. You need not be identified with any race.\nOnce all these hindrances are removed, meditation becomes very simple. And meditation is a nourishment for the flower, it is like the sun rising: as the sun rises the flower starts opening.\nSo remove the barriers and start meditating and becoming silent -- and the sun will rise in its own time and the flower will open up.\n(Osho names another sannyasin, Harsinger; it's also the name of a flower.) Flowers are songs of nature, existence rejoicing. The flower is really the language of delight. In its own way nature is saying that it is happy, celebrating.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nMy sannyasins have to be flowers on a higher plane so that god can feel millions of people around the earth rejoicing. Sannyas is also only a language of delight. I don't teach you anything about hell and heaven and life after death; I only teach you life herenow, and how to be colourful, fragrant, how to dance and sing and how to show your gratitude towards existence. That is enough and that takes care of everything else.\nNo other religion is needed; just be a flower, and in that very being you have prayed -- you have surrendered, you have expressed your gratitude.\n(Madhukamini is the name of a flowers and one that is among his favourites -- Osho tells another sannyasin.)\nIt has a special way: when the Madhukamini flowers then thousands of flowers come to the tree. They don't come in small numbers they explode; the whole tree becomes just flowers.\nAnd another beautiful thing about the Madhukamini is that It blooms in the night. Flowers ordinarily bloom in the day, they need the sun. Only very courageous flowers bloom in the night. They don't bother about the sun and darkness does not disturb them at all. It is a white flowers you can see it even in darkness.\nAnd the third thing about Madhukamini is that with just a small breeze its petals start falling down, showering like rain. In the morning yoU will find a thick layer of petals all around the tree, and it is so fragrant that just one single tree is enough for at least half a mile.\nI would like my sannyasins to be like Madhukamini because the night is really dark. Humanity is passing through a very dark space; unless we decide to flower in darkness there is no possibility of flowering.\nIndividual flowers have happened -- a Buddha, a Jesus, a Zarathustra, a Lao Tzu\n-- but that is not going to change humanity. That is just like your pouring a spoonful of sugar into the ocean and hoping, that the ocean will become sweet. It is hoping against hope.\nWe need an explosion, thousands of Buddhas are needed around the earth; less than that won't do.\nUnless millions of people bloom humanity cannot grow. And it has come to a point where either it has to grow or it has to commit suicide. It has never been so crucial before. Nature has brought man to the ultimate point where a decision is needed, a conscious decision. Nature is not going to help any more, nature has done its work. As far as nature is concerned its work is complete. Now man has to take his own evolution in his own hands -- and that's the whole purpose of sannyas.\nMISERY MAKES MONADS OF MEN\nThe miserable person becomes closed. That is the nature of misery, the intrinsic nature of misery, that it closes you; all the windows, all the doors, are closed. You are afraid, so much so that you withdraw within yourself. Misery makes one introvert and introversion is a kind of morbidity, it is slow suicide.\nOne should be capable of going in but one should also be capable of going out. One should remain free; one should not become obsessed either with the inner or with the outer, because both together make our lifes both together create the harmony, the balance.\nThe categories into which Jung has divided humanity are true as far as the humanity that exists today is concerned -- but they should not be true for the future. Jung divides humanity into the extrovert and the introvert but that division has to be dissolved; one should become capable of both. And the miracle is that the moment you are capable of both you transcend both. Only the transcendental can be capable of moving in and moving out. Something that is neither in nor out can move between the two. The in cannot come out, the out cannot go in; a third element, which can have the movement, is needed.\nMisery makes people introverts. It is a kind of psychological grave. Blissfulness makes people more communicative, more available, more open,,more vulnerable, more healthy. Extroverts are always healthier than introverts -- for\nthe simple reason that they relate with life, and life is god. And when you relate, when you rejoice, when you share with existence, existence also responds. It is not indifferent to you, it is a very loving existence. If we are blissful it showers its love on us.\nSo the first thing is to become blissful, because humanity is almost crippled and paralysed because of its misery.\nWe have lived the misery and the pattern of misery for so long that it has almost become our life style.\nIn fact people think the more miserable a person is, the holier he is; the more sad, the more serious, the longer the face the greater saint people think he is.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nChristians say Jesus never laughed, never in his whole life. It does not say anything about Jesus, it simply says something about the Christians: that is their idea of a perfect saint. How can a perfect saint like Christ laugh? -- laughter seems to be so human and he is the son of god.\nThis is a very ugly approach towards life, very ill, sick, sickening, nauseating. My approach is just the opposite of it. To me laughter is prayer, to me blissfulness is virtue, because it's only through laughter and blissfulness that you will become a beloved of god.\nYes, one should also be capable of going in, because there too god exists. He is within, he is without, and he should be tasted in every possible way. He should be experienced from all possible aspects and dimensions -- and these two are very fundamental dimensions. But first one should experience god through bliss by communicating with stars and trees and rivers and mountains, by communing with people, animals, birds. That is a natural phenomenon. When you have experienced god without, then it is easy to move in.\nNow you know that if god exists in everything he must exist in you too. It can't be otherwise; he is life and you are alive and he is everywhere -- how can he miss you? He must be there too.\nThe experience of god in the universe, in its beauty, in its splendour, makes one trust going in to the deepest core, to dive deep. Then the interior and the exterior become one, then it is one spectrum and you can easily move from one polarity to the other. When a person is capable of moving between the both with ease then he is a sannyasin.\nI am against monks and nuns and the people who have renounced the world -- they are all morbid, sick, cowardly, afraid. It is out of fear that they have become closed.\nOne should go inside to discover, not out of fear but on an exploration. The inner-going consciousness should be an adventure, not out of any fear. There is no need to be afraid, there is nothing to be afraid of. If only god is then how can there be anything to be afraid of?\nSo to me the first thing is to be blissful -- that will help you to experience god in manifold forms around you -- and then enquire within. And then remain available for both, never cling to any one aspect.\nThe truth can be true only if it is whole. The moment you divide it you destroy it.\nGOD: AS CLOSE AS YOU ARE CONSCIOUS\nMeditation is a certain kind of archery; god is the target and we are the arrows. And once we are clear about the goal then the arrow starts moving in a direct line, it does not go zigzag.\nJesus says the path to god is narrow but straight. Both qualifications are significant. It is narrow, narrow because only one person can walk on it. You cannot take somebody with you, you have to go alone, hence it is narrow, so narrow that you cannot even take your friend, your beloved, with you. You have to go alone; nobody can go in a crowd. And it is straight; nobody can go zigzag, one can only go like an arrow.\nThe whole thing is to be aware that god is our target. In everything we are\nsearching for god. That's why there is so much frustration in life.\nYou love a person but it is not long before misery starts settling in. All those fantasies of the honeymoon days are finished. They don't last long; soon there is despair, a kind of hopelessness. Why? The analysis that people make is wrong; they think this person has failed them and the same is the attitude of the other, he thinks you have failed him or her. Nobody has failed anybody, in fact both were searching for god and god has not been found. They were imagining god in their lovers and they have found only very limited human beings with all kinds of ugliness, possessiveness, jealousy. Their idea was of something divine and what they have found is very ordinary -- that's the frustration.\nWhen people fall in love, they always fall in love with god. In the beginning lovers always think of the other as divine. The man thinks he has found the woman, the woman he has been searching for his whole life. The woman may be absolutely crazy.\nNow, Teertha is here sitting just behind you: he has found Krishna -- one of the craziest women in the whole commune -- and he thinks this is the woman he has been searching for his whole life!\nBut how long can you think that? Within two or three days Krishna will reveal her reality and then Teertha will say, \"My god! -- is this the woman I have been looking for my whole life?\" But this happens to every lover.\nAnd it is not only about love but about everything. The person who has been searching for money thinks that once he has got enough money, so many million dollars, he will feel at ease -- arrived -- and there will be no need to worry and no need to be miserable; then he can rest and enjoy life. By the time he reaches the 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\npoint suddenly he realizes that the money is there but there is no relaxation, no rest, no joy. He is as miserable as before or even more, because at least before there was a certain hope; even that hope has left.\nMy own observation is that people are searching for god in love, in money, in prestige, and they are going to fail everywhere because god cannot be found this way; they are looking in the wrong direction.\nThey are not conscious of their search.\nA sannyasin has to be absolutely conscious of the search, conscious that we are looking for the ultimate truth in everything. Once this is clear then everything else becomes secondary and god is the only quest, then life can move like an arrow, directly. And the miracle can happen even in a single moment. If one is really conscious then god is not far away.\nThe distance between god and you is really the distance of consciousness; if you are unconscious then god is far away. The more unconscious you are the farther away he is; the more conscious you are, the closer. If you are absolutely conscious then this very moment god is possible -- because god surrounds you.\nHe is your breath, he is your very heartbeat. LOVE -- THE SOUL'S SCENT\nThe Sufis have one hundred names for god, in fact, ninety-nine, because one is not spoken and cannot be spoken but it has to be counted. It is silent. That is the truest name, the hundredth, but there is no way to say it. Ninety-nine names are ninety-nine aspects. Kamil is one of the aspects of god: perfection. And the thing that man can bring closest to perfection is love. It is because of this that Jesus said god is love, because in the human experience the most perfect experience possible is that of love; all other experiences are going to be very imperfect.\nFor example, one can have great physical strength but it cannot be perfect. Even the greatest wrestler has to die; in fact the wrestlers die early deaths and they die out of very dangerous diseases. Gama died of tuberculosis. In those days there was no medicine for tuberculosis. He had the most perfect body possible but he died very early. The body has limitations, the mind has also limitations; even the most perfect mind has its flaws.\nEven a man like Albert Einstein, who is certainly the greatest mathematician in the whole of human history, used to commit such errors in his calculations that even a school child would laugh. He himself was puzzled at how he could manage to know about the infinite universe when he committed such small\nerrors.\nOnce it happened that he was travelling in a bus, he gave the fare to the conductor and the conductor gave him back some change. Einstein counted it and he said 'This is not enough, give me more.' The conductor counted the change again and gave it back to him and said 'This is perfectly okay.' Einstein counted again and he said 'No, this is not right.' And the man said 'That means you don't know how to count\n-- get lost!' He was not aware that this man was Albert Einstein, and what he is saying to him 'You don't know how to count, you don't know even a little arithmetic. Don't bother me and don't bite my head off.'\nAlbert Einstein has recounted in his memoirs that it was a shock but the conductor was right: when Einstein counted, the conductor was right and Einstein was wrong.\nMind has its limitations because it is a machine. Only one thing has no limitations, and that is love, because it is beyond body-mind; it is the only spiritual quality. Love is the fragrance of the soul, hence it comes closest to perfection. Living a life of love is living a life of prayer, religiousness, spirituality.\nMy whole message is of love. Love unconditionally, love for no other reason but for love's sake -- and that will bring you closer and closer to god every moment of your life. And in fact when love is perfect god immediately happens, because love's perfection and god's happening are two sides of the same coin.\nTHERE'LL ALWAYS BE AN INNER-LAND\n(And unless we explore it we will remain outsiders to ourselves, Osho tells Swami Svadesh.) Svadesh means one's true country, one's own country. To translate it is a little bit difficult because 'sva'\nmeans your innermost self and 'desh' means the land, the country -- the country of your innermost self. It is unexplored, and man is so mad that he goes on exploring everything else.\nHe will go to Everest, to the North Pole, to the South Pole, he will go to the moon. Now he is trying to reach to Mars and soon he will be going to other\nplanets; preparations are on the way, projects are on the 1/08/07 Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nway. And nobody exactly bothers about why.\nWhat are you going to do even if you reach the moon? You will be the same fool as you are here. What is going to happen on the moon? You will fight in the same old way. Christians will be Christians, Hindus will be Hindus, Russians will be Russians, Americans will be Americans, and they will start dividing the territories and they will start putting up their flags and fighting. The same thing will be repeated on the moon, on Mars, on every planet wherever man goes, because unless you change nothing is going to happen.\nThe whole misery is because one thing remains unexplored, and that is our innermost territory. And that is where the light is, that is where the potential for transformation exists.\nSannyas means a decision to explore your inner world; it is the search for your real country. Unless you have found it wherever you are, you are going to remain a foreigner. Even in your so-called country you will be a foreigner. Only the man who has discovered himself is at home. Wherever he is he is at home because he has found the home.\nWOMB IN THE IN\nMan is not only miserly in giving, he is even more miserly in receiving, because in fact as far as giving is concerned it is not against the ego; the ego enjoys it. You are the giver, you are higher than the person to whom you are giving. But ego feels very humiliated in receiving because ego feels you are lower and the person who is giving is higher. and all that is significant in life has to be received, it cannot be achieved.\nLove cannot be achieved, truth cannot be achieved, peace cannot be achieved, god cannot be achieved; you just have to be receptive like a womb, available. You have to become a host. And unless you trust existence you cannot be a host.\nIf you are too cautious then you cannot welcome everything and in your very cautiousness you will miss the real guest.\nGod is missed because people are not ready to receive, otherwise god comes every moment and knocks on your door. There is no need to go in search of god, god in continuously searching for you, but you are not ready to receive. And it is such a great gift that unless you put your whole ego aside you will not be in a welcoming mood.\nTo welcome existence simply means to surrender the ego. In the very surrender of the ego your heart opens and becomes just a welcome -- and then miracles are possible. And everybody is entitled to miracles.\nIf they are not happening then you are not allowing them to happen -- remember it!\nINNO-SCENTS: THE FRAGRANCE OF SAGE\nPavitro means pure, innocent -- pure not in the sense of morality, pure in the sense of innocence. One has not to become a saint one has to become like a child. That is the difference between the saint and the sage: the sage is childlike and the saint is very calculative, each of his moves is very calculated. He is like a chess-players he contemplates at least three or four or five moves ahead of time: 'If I do this what will happen? If I do this am I going to fall into hell or reach heaven? If I do this will I be accumulating virtue or not? and how much? The saint is basically a Jew. All saints are Jews and all Jews are saints! (laughter) The whole thing is businesslike.\nThe sage is innocent. He lives like a child. That's what Jesus means when he says 'Unless you are like small children you will not enter into the kingdom of god.' Now, he couldn't mean saints because they are never like small children. He must have meant sages.\nChristianity has avoided even the word. In Christianity sages have not existed at all, only saints -- and Christians have a very ugly meaning of the word 'saint'.\nIn Sanskrit also the word exists as 'sant'; -- it is the same word as 'saint' -- but in Sanskrit it means one who has achieved truth. 'Sat' means truth and 'sant' means one who has achieved it -- but the Christian meaning of saint is very ugly. It means one who has been given sanction by the church, that yes, he is a saint. He\nis sanctioned, certified -- -that is the meaning of the Christian saint.\nSo sometimes it happens that they give posthumous sainthood. The person may have died three hundred years ago. In fact he may have been condemned by the Christians and then later on they start feeling guilty; they find out that that was not the right step, so they make him a saint.\nIt happens in the reverse order too: a saint may have died three hundred years ago -- he was sanctioned 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nby the church, then later on they discover that he was not really a saint -- according to the rules (laughter), so they take the certificate back!\nYou will be surprised that it has even happened -- this is unbelievable -- that one saint who died three hundred years ago had his certificate taken away -- and when you take away the certificate, of course, something has to be done. And what can you do? -- the man has been dead for three hundred years. His grave was dug up and his bones were taken out and dragged along the road, and insulted in every possible way... because what else can you do? For three hundred years you have worshipped the wrong person, now the balance has to be put right.\nJust now this Polack pope has reopened the case of Galileo, because now they recognise that it was foolish to ask him to change his idea, his hypothesis that the earth goes around the sun. They had called old Galileo -- he was seventy-five or more -- from his deathbed. He was dragged to the court of the pope and he was forced to kneel down and he was told to ask forgiveness for the sin that he has committed against the Bible -- because the Bible says the sun moves around the earth and how could he dare to go against the sacred scripture?\nGalileo must have been a very sensible man. He said 'That's perfectly right -- I must be wrong. How can I be right against the scripture? -- the scripture has to be right. So forgive me.' And when he was getting up one of his friends said 'Are you really changing your hypothesis?' Galileo said 'What is wrong in changing\nthe hypothesis? because my changing of the hypothesis is not going to make any difference at all; the truth is that the earth goes around the sun. Even if I change it the earth is not going to listen to me, neither is the sun going to listen to me. Why should I get into unnecessary trouble?'\nThe case was closed because he asked forgiveness, but now they are feeling guilty because now it is absolutely a fact.… It looks ugly that the church did this stupid thing with Galileo, so, the pope has ordered the case to be opened again, and for things to be put right.\nThe Christian idea of a saint is just like a certificate of a university you are certified, you have followed the rules and regulations. But that is possible only if the man has been very calculative. In fact I don't think, if Christians were asked to issue a certificate for Jesus, that they would be willing to. I don't think they would because he never followed their rules and regulations; he cannot be given saint-hood.\nNobody has asked -- nobody has raised the question, but I want to raise the question (laughter)...\nwhether Jesus is a saint or not. What kind of saint is he? He showed nothing of the sainthoodness that is expected of Christians. He moved with prostitutes, gamblers, drunkards, he enjoyed eating, drinking and merrying. He must have been a man more like Zorba than like a saint. If he were a saint the Jews would not have crucified him.\nHe was a sage, certainly, but not a saint. But that word does not exist in the Christian vocabulary. Sage is a Taoist terminology; Lao Tzu is a sage, Chuang Tzu is a sage. They don't talk about saints, saints are just very ordinary people. Sinners are against the social rules and saints are fulfilling the same rules. They are not very different; as far as their quality is concerned they belong to the same category. But the sage transcends them both. When I use the word 'pure' I mean the sage, not the saint.\nBe like small children. Rejoice, wonder, live in awe! Each moment life brings so many surprises that it is strange that people are not living in a continuous 'Aha!' 'Aha!' and...\n(There is a peal of laughter. Osho pauses -- then says:) Say it loudly!

represents hardness, the flower represents 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished>Osho's books on

creativity.</p><p>Every rock has to become a flower; every rock has the seed to become
a flower, it has the potential. But one has to discover the flower, one
has to remove the rock chunk by chunk so only the flower is left. The
flower is the very centre of the rock. In fact the rock is not your
enemy, it protects the flower until the time is ripe.</p><p>So one should not be against the rock but one should not cling to it
either. Be</p><p>thankful to it but now the moment has come to discard it. Now let it
be something that is past, that is no more relevant, that will not have
any meaning in the future. Now the future belongs to the flower. Think
of yourself as being more like a flower with all its softness,
vulnerability, delicateness, feminineness, receptivity.</p><p>The flower lives very momentarily, it is not stable. The rock is far
more stable, it is almost permanent.</p><p>The flower is born in the morning and may be gone by the evening yet
for those few moments that it lived it <em>really</em> lived. It danced
in the wind, in the sun, in the rain -- it rejoiced.</p><p>The rock may be almost permanent but it is dead, it lives not.
Durability has no value. Even a single moment of total aliveness is far
more significant than being dead for the whole of eternity.</p><p>So let the rock be the past and the flower the future. PARIJAT IS THE
NAME OF AN EASTERN FLOWER</p><p>Parijat is the name of an Eastern flower.</p><p>Flowers represent many things. The one thing that is the most
important of all those is the phenomenon of flowering, of opening.</p><p>Man is also a flower, but closed like a bud. And unless we make a
deliberate effort, unless we help, it won't open on its own. Society has
created every kind of hindrance for its opening. Society is against the
ultimate flowering of man because the moment a man flowers he becomes
transcendental to all kinds of social formalities, structures,
religions, nations, ideologies -- and everybody is afraid of that
transcendence.</p><p>That means one has gone beyond all that you cherish and think of as
very valuable.</p><p>To the transcendental consciousness all social morality is childish,
stupid. Nations and politics are only for the mediocre, for the
unintelligent; they are almost for the insane.</p><p>It has happened just now in America: the whole country has gone from
choosing a peanut as president to choosing a big nut! And this goes on
happening everywhere -- small nuts are replaced by bigger nuts. Only
bigger nuts can replace them because only the bigger can push them out;
otherwise they won't budge an inch.</p><p>The man who becomes transcendental is no longer a Hindu nor a
Christian nor a Mohammedan, is neither German nor French nor Indian; he
transcends all these limitations. That's why no society wants anybody to
flower: people should remain mediocre, ungrown-up, because those
ungrown-up people are always dependent on leaders, on priests, on popes,
on imams and ayatollahs. They are always dependent on somebody. They
have to be -- they need a father figure.</p><p>The ungrown-up person's mental age remains somewhere nearabout twelve
or fourteen; he never goes beyond that. Millions of people die at the
age of fourteen. That is their psychological age and that is the age of
their death too. Then only the body goes on living but their soul
remains absolutely dead, repetitive.</p><p>Sannyasins have to learn how to remove the barriers. And they can be
easily removed, the only thing is that you have to become conscious of
what the barriers are. They can easily be removed because you can just
throw them away, nobody can prevent you. You can simply drop out of all
"isms," ideologies, churches.</p><p>Who can prevent you? You can simply use nations for normal purposes
-- the passport, the visa -- otherwise deep down you can be free. You
need not be a German or an Italian, just to be human is enough. You need
not be identified with any race.</p><p>Once all these hindrances are removed, meditation becomes very
simple. And meditation is a nourishment for the flower, it is like the
sun rising: as the sun rises the flower starts opening.</p><p>So remove the barriers and start meditating and becoming silent --
and the sun will rise in its own time and the flower will open up.</p><p>(Osho names another sannyasin, Harsinger; it's also the name of a
flower.) Flowers are songs of nature, existence rejoicing. The flower is
really the language of delight. In its own way nature is saying that it
is happy, celebrating.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>My sannyasins have to be flowers on a higher plane so that god can
feel millions of people around the earth rejoicing. Sannyas is also only
a language of delight. I don't teach you anything about hell and heaven
and life after death; I only teach you life herenow, and how to be
colourful, fragrant, how to dance and sing and how to show your
gratitude towards existence. That is enough and that takes care of
everything else.</p><p>No other religion is needed; just be a flower, and in that very being
you have prayed -- you have surrendered, you have expressed your
gratitude.</p><p>(Madhukamini is the name of a flowers and one that is among his
favourites -- Osho tells another sannyasin.)</p><p>It has a special way: when the Madhukamini flowers then thousands of
flowers come to the tree. They don't come in small numbers they explode;
the whole tree becomes just flowers.</p><p>And another beautiful thing about the Madhukamini is that It blooms
in the night. Flowers ordinarily bloom in the day, they need the sun.
Only very courageous flowers bloom in the night. They don't bother about
the sun and darkness does not disturb them at all. It is a white flowers
you can see it even in darkness.</p><p>And the third thing about Madhukamini is that with just a small
breeze its petals start falling down, showering like rain. In the
morning yoU will find a thick layer of petals all around the tree, and
it is so fragrant that just one single tree is enough for at least half
a mile.</p><p>I would like my sannyasins to be like Madhukamini because the night
is really dark. Humanity is passing through a very dark space; unless we
decide to flower in darkness there is no possibility of flowering.</p><p>Individual flowers have happened -- a Buddha, a Jesus, a Zarathustra,
a Lao Tzu</p><p>-- but that is not going to change humanity. That is just like your
pouring a spoonful of sugar into the ocean and hoping, that the ocean
will become sweet. It is hoping against hope.</p><p>We need an explosion, thousands of Buddhas are needed around the
earth; less than that won't do.</p><p>Unless millions of people bloom humanity cannot grow. And it has come
to a point where either it has to grow or it has to commit suicide. It
has never been so crucial before. Nature has brought man to the ultimate
point where a decision is needed, a conscious decision. Nature is not
going to help any more, nature has done its work. As far as nature is
concerned its work is complete. Now man has to take his own evolution in
his own hands -- and that's the whole purpose of sannyas.</p><p>MISERY MAKES MONADS OF MEN</p><p>The miserable person becomes closed. That is the nature of misery,
the intrinsic nature of misery, that it closes you; all the windows, all
the doors, are closed. You are afraid, so much so that you withdraw
within yourself. Misery makes one introvert and introversion is a kind
of morbidity, it is slow suicide.</p><p>One should be capable of going in but one should also be capable of
going out. One should remain free; one should not become obsessed either
with the inner or with the outer, because both together make our lifes
both together create the harmony, the balance.</p><p>The categories into which Jung has divided humanity are true as far
as the humanity that exists today is concerned -- but they should not be
true for the future. Jung divides humanity into the extrovert and the
introvert but that division has to be dissolved; one should become
capable of both. And the miracle is that the moment you are capable of
both you transcend both. Only the transcendental can be capable of
moving in and moving out. Something that is neither in nor out can move
between the two. The in cannot come out, the out cannot go in; a third
element, which can have the movement, is needed.</p><p>Misery makes people introverts. It is a kind of psychological grave.
Blissfulness makes people more communicative, more available, more
open,,more vulnerable, more healthy. Extroverts are always healthier
than introverts -- for</p><p>the simple reason that they relate with life, and life is god. And
when you relate, when you rejoice, when you share with existence,
existence also responds. It is not indifferent to you, it is a very
loving existence. If we are blissful it showers its love on us.</p><p>So the first thing is to become blissful, because humanity is almost
crippled and paralysed because of its misery.</p><p>We have lived the misery and the pattern of misery for so long that
it has almost become our life style.</p><p>In fact people think the more miserable a person is, the holier he
is; the more sad, the more serious, the longer the face the greater
saint people think he is.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>Christians say Jesus never laughed, never in his whole life. It does
not say anything about Jesus, it simply says something about the
Christians: that is their idea of a perfect saint. How can a perfect
saint like Christ laugh? -- laughter seems to be so human and he is the
son of god.</p><p>This is a very ugly approach towards life, very ill, sick, sickening,
nauseating. My approach is just the opposite of it. To me laughter is
prayer, to me blissfulness is virtue, because it's only through laughter
and blissfulness that you will become a beloved of god.</p><p>Yes, one should also be capable of going in, because there too god
exists. He is within, he is without, and he should be tasted in every
possible way. He should be experienced from all possible aspects and
dimensions -- and these two are very fundamental dimensions. But first
one should experience god through bliss by communicating with stars and
trees and rivers and mountains, by communing with people, animals,
birds. That is a natural phenomenon. When you have experienced god
without, then it is easy to move in.</p><p>Now you know that if god exists in everything he must exist in you
too. It can't be otherwise; he is life and you are alive and he is
everywhere -- how can he miss you? He must be there too.</p><p>The experience of god in the universe, in its beauty, in its
splendour, makes one trust going in to the deepest core, to dive deep.
Then the interior and the exterior become one, then it is one spectrum
and you can easily move from one polarity to the other. When a person is
capable of moving between the both with ease then he is a sannyasin.</p><p>I am against monks and nuns and the people who have renounced the
world -- they are all morbid, sick, cowardly, afraid. It is out of fear
that they have become closed.</p><p>One should go inside to discover, not out of fear but on an
exploration. The inner-going consciousness should be an adventure, not
out of any fear. There is no need to be afraid, there is nothing to be
afraid of. If only god is then how can there be anything to be afraid
of?</p><p>So to me the first thing is to be blissful -- that will help you to
experience god in manifold forms around you -- and then enquire within.
And then remain available for both, never cling to any one aspect.</p><p>The truth can be true only if it is whole. The moment you divide it
you destroy it.</p><p>GOD: AS CLOSE AS YOU ARE CONSCIOUS</p><p>Meditation is a certain kind of archery; god is the target and we are
the arrows. And once we are clear about the goal then the arrow starts
moving in a direct line, it does not go zigzag.</p><p>Jesus says the path to god is narrow but straight. Both
qualifications are significant. It is narrow, narrow because only one
person can walk on it. You cannot take somebody with you, you have to go
alone, hence it is narrow, so narrow that you cannot even take your
friend, your beloved, with you. You have to go alone; nobody can go in a
crowd. And it is straight; nobody can go zigzag, one can only go like an
arrow.</p><p>The whole thing is to be aware that god is our target. In everything
we are</p><p>searching for god. That's why there is so much frustration in
life.</p><p>You love a person but it is not long before misery starts settling
in. All those fantasies of the honeymoon days are finished. They don't
last long; soon there is despair, a kind of hopelessness. Why? The
analysis that people make is wrong; they think <em>this</em> person has
failed them and the same is the attitude of the other, he thinks you
have failed him or her. Nobody has failed anybody, in fact both were
searching for god and god has not been found. They were imagining god in
their lovers and they have found only very limited human beings with all
kinds of ugliness, possessiveness, jealousy. Their idea was of something
divine and what they have found is very ordinary -- that's the
frustration.</p><p>When people fall in love, they always fall in love with god. In the
beginning lovers always think of the other as divine. The man thinks he
has found the woman, the woman he has been searching for his whole life.
The woman may be absolutely crazy.</p><p>Now, Teertha is here sitting just behind you: he has found Krishna --
one of the craziest women in the whole commune -- and he thinks this is
the woman he has been searching for his whole life!</p><p>But how long can you think that? Within two or three days Krishna
will reveal her reality and then Teertha will say, "My god! -- is this
the woman I have been looking for my whole life?" But this happens to
every lover.</p><p>And it is not only about love but about everything. The person who
has been searching for money thinks that once he has got enough money,
so many million dollars, he will feel at ease -- arrived -- and there
will be no need to worry and no need to be miserable; then he can rest
and enjoy life. By the time he reaches the 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>point suddenly he realizes that the money is there but there is no
relaxation, no rest, no joy. He is as miserable as before or even more,
because at least before there was a certain hope; even that hope has
left.</p><p>My own observation is that people are searching for god in love, in
money, in prestige, and they are going to fail everywhere because god
cannot be found this way; they are looking in the wrong direction.</p><p>They are not conscious of their search.</p><p>A sannyasin has to be absolutely conscious of the search, conscious
that we are looking for the ultimate truth in everything. Once this is
clear then everything else becomes secondary and god is the only quest,
then life can move like an arrow, directly. And the miracle can happen
even in a single moment. If one is really conscious then god is not far
away.</p><p>The distance between god and you is really the distance of
consciousness; if you are unconscious then god is far away. The more
unconscious you are the farther away he is; the more conscious you are,
the closer. If you are absolutely conscious then this very moment god is
possible -- because god surrounds you.</p><p>He is your breath, he is your very heartbeat. LOVE -- THE SOUL'S
SCENT</p><p>The Sufis have one hundred names for god, in fact, ninety-nine,
because one is not spoken and cannot be spoken but it has to be counted.
It is silent. That is the truest name, the hundredth, but there is no
way to say it. Ninety-nine names are ninety-nine aspects. Kamil is one
of the aspects of god: perfection. And the thing that man can bring
closest to perfection is love. It is because of this that Jesus said god
is love, because in the human experience the most perfect experience
possible is that of love; all other experiences are going to be very
imperfect.</p><p>For example, one can have great physical strength but it cannot be
perfect. Even the greatest wrestler has to die; in fact the wrestlers
die early deaths and they die out of very dangerous diseases. Gama died
of tuberculosis. In those days there was no medicine for tuberculosis.
He had the most perfect body possible but he died very early. The body
has limitations, the mind has also limitations; even the most perfect
mind has its flaws.</p><p>Even a man like Albert Einstein, who is certainly the greatest
mathematician in the whole of human history, used to commit such errors
in his calculations that even a school child would laugh. He himself was
puzzled at how he could manage to know about the infinite universe when
he committed such small</p><p>errors.</p><p>Once it happened that he was travelling in a bus, he gave the fare to
the conductor and the conductor gave him back some change. Einstein
counted it and he said 'This is not enough, give me more.' The conductor
counted the change again and gave it back to him and said 'This is
perfectly okay.' Einstein counted again and he said 'No, this is not
right.' And the man said 'That means you don't know how to count</p><p>-- get lost!' He was not aware that this man was Albert Einstein, and
what he is saying to him 'You don't know how to count, you don't know
even a little arithmetic. Don't bother me and don't bite my head
off.'</p><p>Albert Einstein has recounted in his memoirs that it was a shock but
the conductor was right: when Einstein counted, the conductor was right
and Einstein was wrong.</p><p>Mind has its limitations because it is a machine. Only one thing has
no limitations, and that is love, because it is beyond body-mind; it is
the only spiritual quality. Love is the fragrance of the soul, hence it
comes closest to perfection. Living a life of love is living a life of
prayer, religiousness, spirituality.</p><p>My whole message is of love. Love unconditionally, love for no other
reason but for love's sake -- and that will bring you closer and closer
to god every moment of your life. And in fact when love is perfect god
immediately happens, because love's perfection and god's happening are
two sides of the same coin.</p><p>THERE'LL ALWAYS BE AN INNER-LAND</p><p>(And unless we explore it we will remain outsiders to ourselves, Osho
tells Swami Svadesh.) Svadesh means one's true country, one's own
country. To translate it is a little bit difficult because 'sva'</p><p>means your innermost self and 'desh' means the land, the country --
the country of your innermost self. It is unexplored, and man is so mad
that he goes on exploring everything else.</p><p>He will go to Everest, to the North Pole, to the South Pole, he will
go to the moon. Now he is trying to reach to Mars and soon he will be
going to other</p><p>planets; preparations are on the way, projects are on the 1/08/07

same fool as you are here. What is going to happen on the moon? You will
fight in the same old way. Christians will be Christians, Hindus will be
Hindus, Russians will be Russians, Americans will be Americans, and they
will start dividing the territories and they will start putting up their
flags and fighting. The same thing will be repeated on the moon, on
Mars, on every planet wherever man goes, because unless <em>you</em>
change nothing is going to happen.</p><p>The whole misery is because one thing remains unexplored, and that is
our innermost territory. And that is where the light is, that is where
the potential for transformation exists.</p><p>Sannyas means a decision to explore your inner world; it is the
search for your real country. Unless you have found it wherever you are,
you are going to remain a foreigner. Even in your so-called country you
will be a foreigner. Only the man who has discovered himself is at home.
Wherever he is he is at home because he has found the home.</p><p>WOMB IN THE IN</p><p>Man is not only miserly in giving, he is even more miserly in
receiving, because in fact as far as giving is concerned it is not
against the ego; the ego enjoys it. You are the giver, you are higher
than the person to whom you are giving. But ego feels very humiliated in
receiving because ego feels you are lower and the person who is giving
is higher. and all that is significant in life has to be received, it
cannot be achieved.</p><p>Love cannot be achieved, truth cannot be achieved, peace cannot be
achieved, god cannot be achieved; you just have to be receptive like a
womb, available. You have to become a host. And unless you trust
existence you cannot be a host.</p><p>If you are too cautious then you cannot welcome everything and in
your very cautiousness you will miss the real guest.</p><p>God is missed because people are not ready to receive, otherwise god
comes every moment and knocks on your door. There is no need to go in
search of god, god in continuously searching for you, but you are not
ready to receive. And it is such a great gift that unless you put your
whole ego aside you will not be in a welcoming mood.</p><p>To welcome existence simply means to surrender the ego. In the very
surrender of the ego your heart opens and becomes just a welcome -- and
then miracles are possible. And everybody is entitled to miracles.</p><p>If they are not happening then you are not <em>allowing</em> them to
happen -- remember it!</p><p>INNO-SCENTS: THE FRAGRANCE OF SAGE</p><p>Pavitro means pure, innocent -- pure not in the sense of morality,
pure in the sense of innocence. One has not to become a saint one has to
become like a child. That is the difference between the saint and the
sage: the sage is childlike and the saint is very calculative, each of
his moves is very calculated. He is like a chess-players he contemplates
at least three or four or five moves ahead of time: 'If I do this what
will happen? If I do this am I going to fall into hell or reach heaven?
If I do this will I be accumulating virtue or not? and how much? The
saint is basically a Jew. All saints are Jews and all Jews are saints!
(laughter) The whole thing is businesslike.</p><p>The sage is innocent. He lives like a child. That's what Jesus means
when he says 'Unless you are like small children you will not enter into
the kingdom of god.' Now, he couldn't mean saints because they are never
like small children. He must have meant sages.</p><p>Christianity has avoided even the word. In Christianity sages have
not existed at all, only saints -- and Christians have a very ugly
meaning of the word 'saint'.</p><p>In Sanskrit also the word exists as 'sant'; -- it is the same word as
'saint' -- but in Sanskrit it means one who has achieved truth. 'Sat'
means truth and 'sant' means one who has achieved it -- but the
Christian meaning of saint is very ugly. It means one who has been given
sanction by the church, that yes, he is a saint. He</p><p>is sanctioned, certified -- -that is the meaning of the Christian
saint.</p><p>So sometimes it happens that they give posthumous sainthood. The
person may have died three hundred years ago. In fact he may have been
condemned by the Christians and then later on they start feeling guilty;
they find out that that was not the right step, so they make him a
saint.</p><p>It happens in the reverse order too: a saint may have died three
hundred years ago -- he was sanctioned 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-5>Osho's books on

saint -- according to the rules (laughter), so they take the certificate
back!</p><p>You will be surprised that it has even happened -- this is
unbelievable -- that one saint who died three hundred years ago had his
certificate taken away -- and when you take away the certificate, of
course, something has to be done. And what can you do? -- the man has
been dead for three hundred years. His grave was dug up and his bones
were taken out and dragged along the road, and insulted in every
possible way... because what else can you do? For three hundred years
you have worshipped the wrong person, now the balance has to be put
right.</p><p>Just now this Polack pope has reopened the case of Galileo, because
now they recognise that it was foolish to ask him to change his idea,
his hypothesis that the earth goes around the sun. They had called old
Galileo -- he was seventy-five or more -- from his deathbed. He was
dragged to the court of the pope and he was forced to kneel down and he
was told to ask forgiveness for the sin that he has committed against
the Bible -- because the Bible says the sun moves around the earth and
how could he dare to go against the sacred scripture?</p><p>Galileo must have been a very sensible man. He said 'That's perfectly
right -- I must be wrong. How can I be right against the scripture? --
the scripture <em>has</em> to be right. So forgive me.' And when he was
getting up one of his friends said 'Are you really changing your
hypothesis?' Galileo said 'What is wrong in changing</p><p>the hypothesis? because my changing of the hypothesis is not going to
make any difference at all; the truth is that the earth goes around the
sun. Even if I change it the earth is not going to listen to me, neither
is the sun going to listen to me. Why should I get into unnecessary
trouble?'</p><p>The case was closed because he asked forgiveness, but now they are
feeling guilty because now it is absolutely a fact.… It looks ugly that
the church did this stupid thing with Galileo, so, the pope has ordered
the case to be opened again, and for things to be put right.</p><p>The Christian idea of a saint is just like a certificate of a
university you are certified, you have followed the rules and
regulations. But that is possible only if the man has been very
calculative. In fact I don't think, if Christians were asked to issue a
certificate for Jesus, that they would be willing to. I don't think they
would because he never followed their rules and regulations; he cannot
be given saint-hood.</p><p>Nobody has asked -- nobody has raised the question, but I want to
raise the question (laughter)...</p><p>whether Jesus is a saint or not. What kind of saint is he? He showed
nothing of the sainthoodness that is expected of Christians. He moved
with prostitutes, gamblers, drunkards, he enjoyed eating, drinking and
merrying. He must have been a man more like Zorba than like a saint. If
he were a saint the Jews would not have crucified him.</p><p>He was a sage, certainly, but not a saint. But that word does not
exist in the Christian vocabulary. Sage is a Taoist terminology; Lao Tzu
is a sage, Chuang Tzu is a sage. They don't talk about saints, saints
are just very ordinary people. Sinners are against the social rules and
saints are fulfilling the same rules. They are not very different; as
far as their quality is concerned they belong to the same category. But
the sage transcends them both. When I use the word 'pure' I mean the
sage, not the saint.</p><p>Be like small children. Rejoice, wonder, live in awe! Each moment
life brings so many surprises that it is strange that people are not
living in a continuous 'Aha!' 'Aha!' and...</p><p>(There is a peal of laughter. Osho pauses -- then says:) Say it
loudly! You said it very...(more laughter) only in the heart; say it
loudly -- aha! You will have to</p><p>learn!</p><p>-- How long will you be here?</p><p>-- Four days.</p><p>-- Aha! (gales of laughter) <strong>Going All the Way</strong>

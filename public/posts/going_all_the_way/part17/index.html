Other animals also have reason, maybe a little less -\n- but the difference is only of degree; there is no qualitative difference. And now we know that even machines can have intelligence, computers can have intelligence.\nA computer is more rational than any man can ever be, more rational than Aristotle himself. Aristotle was not very rational. He had two wives -- now, a\nrational person cannot even have one -- -- and for his whole life he was tortured by two women. One is enough, in fact more than enough; to be pulled by two is not a very rational decision. And he writes in books a thousand and one irrational things.\nOne of the most irrational things he writes is that women have less teeth than men. He had two wives, he could have asked them or counted their teeth; it would have been so simple an experiment. No laboratory, no science was needed, just simple arithmetic, but he never bothered. The idea was prevalent in Greece that women have less teeth. Obviously they must have everything less than men. That is the male chauvinist idea: everything should be less. How can they have an equal number of teeth? That is irrational.\nMy observation is that love is the only quality that making man different from everything else in existence. But very few men are loving. So all men are not distinguished, they are ordinary. Only once in a while a Christ -- a Buddha, a Lao Tzu, has experienced the ultimate peak of love and they are the salt of the earth.\nMy sannyasins have to move deeper into the phenomenon of love, they have to explore it in every possible way and they have to purify it of all lust. They have to make it more and more close to prayer, and ultimately it becomes just prayer.\nWhen love is just a prayerfulness one has attained true humanity, then one is really born_born as a man.\nBefore that one was only in the womb, asleep. To attain love is to be a rake. CREATOR OR HATER\nLove has immense power but a very different kind of power. We are acquainted with the power of violence and aggression, we are acquainted with the animal power -- destructive power. That's why we go on writing history about Alexander the Great and Genghis Khan and Tamerlane and Nadir Shah and Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin and so on and so forth. These people have a certain power but that power is of violence, aggression, destruction. It is against god, it is against existence. These people are really criminals.\nHistory needs to be rewritten, these people should be completely dropped out of history as if they never existed. Children should not be poisoned with their\nnames.\nHistory should be concerned with Gautam the Buddha, Jesus Christ, Zarathustra, Krishna, Kabir, Meera, Rabiya -- men and women of love. They also have a power but that is a totally different kind of power, it creates. To destroy is very easy. Any child can do it, any fool can do it, it needs no intelligence. But to create needs great intelligence. It can be done only by people who experience beauty, truth, love.\nTo be creative means to be part of god because god is the creator, to create means to participate in his creativity -- and that -- q the power of love. The man of love always creates. Poetry -- music, painting, or whatsoever he does is creative. And the man of creativity slowly slowly learns about love.\nBut my approach is to start from love because that is the centre, and creativity is the circumference. If the centre is there the circumference will happen automatically, but to create first and then to move towards love, is a far long process. It may take lives and even then there is no certainty -- because each time you die 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nyou lose whatsoever you have attained on the circumference -- because each life will give you a different circumference,,only the centre remains the same. So whatsoever we attain at the centre of our being becomes ours forever, death cannot destroy it -- it will be with you in the new life. It goes on accumulating; circumferences go on changing every life. So many times people create much on the circumference but they lose it again and again.\nMy whole effort here is to start from the centre itself, only then are you on the right track. Love and let love become creativity in your life. That is my whole religion. Love plus creativity is equal to religion.\nTRUE RELIGION: AESTHETICISM, NOT ASCETICISM\nBeauty is the most godly experience. One should not think about god in terms of\ntheology -- that is the wrong route, an absolutely wrong route. One should think aesthetically about god, and to think aesthetically really means to feel. You cannot think aesthetically, you can only feel. Beauty is felt, not thought. You don't think that the sunset is beautiful, you know, you feel; that's why you cannot prove it to others. If somebody denies it there is no way to prove that it really is beautiful. If somebody says the rose flower is not beautiful what can be done? We can feel sorry for him but we cannot help him to experience the beauty of the rose.\nHe is not available to the rose, his heart is not open to the rose.\nThere are millions of people who have not experienced beauty and whatsoever they think is beauty is nothing but biological lust. If a man thinks that only a woman can be beautiful and never bothers about the sunrise or the flowers or a bird on the wing or the clouds or the stars, he does not know anything of the woman either. It is only the hormonal, the instinctive, the unconscious in him, which makes him clouded, infatuated, and which makes him think the woman is beautiful -- that is not the experience of beauty.\nThe experience of beauty has nothing to do with biology, it has something aesthetic. And when you know the aesthetics of beauty then certainly a woman, a man, the trees, the clouds, the mountains... then the whole universe is involved in it. And to experience beauty in all its forms is to feel god. That's why I say beauty is the most divine experience.\nBecome available to beauty in all its forms. Open up open as many doors and windows as possible. The more you know of beauty, the more you will know of god. And the beautiful thing about this experience is that you will not become a Christian or a Hindu or a Mohammedan because you are not going via theology; you are approaching god directly, not via the priests. The priest poisons. He is the greatest poisoner, the greatest curse that has ever happened to humanity. The priest has to be avoided like the plague.\nHumanity will be in a far more superior position when the priests become something of the past, just part of history. You can save a few for the museums and zoos, etcetera but they should not be part of humanity any more. Pope the Polack will look very beautiful in a zoo (laughter). People can watch, just as they watch the hippopotamus, and they can ask what kind of animal this is? -- and that will be perfectly okay. But priests should not be allowed to dominate\nhumanity any more; they have done enough harm.\nThe best way to destroy the whole strategy, the whole trade secret of the priest is to make man some direct route that he can follow towards god. And my observation is that the aesthetic experience is the most immediate. It needs no via media, no mediator -- it is immediate, it overwhelms one.\n(And bliss is about as aesthetic as you can be. Osho goes on to talk to Anand Monika about the two ways in which you can come to know bliss.)\nThere are two kinds of blissful experiences: one is of love, the other is of meditation.\nLove needs at least two people, it is a dialogue between two energies. But because the other is needed there is a limitation, it cannot be infinite. And because the other is needed there is a certain kind of dependence; hence lovers love each other but deep do, they cannot forgive each other. They ca}mot forgive the other because they have become dependent, hence the constant quarrelling between lovers. It is very significant s why do lovers go on quarrelling? They should be the last to quarrel, but they are the topmost quarrellers. Even enemies don't quarrel that much, in fact they don't meet! And lovers are together twenty- four hours a day, at each other's neck, fighting tooth and nail. Only once and a while are there love-breaks, otherwise they are wrestling; they are intimate enemies.\nThe reason for their enmity is very subtle and unconscious -- it is the dependence. Nobody likes to be dependent on anybody else because freedom is the highest value of life. But if you want the joy of love you have to compromise and that compromise hurts. The other starts encroaching on your space, you start 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nencroaching on the other's space.\nLove is one kind of joy, but it is a very limited phenomenon. Unless one has\nknown the other kind of bliss... and that rarely happens. That comes through meditation. Meditation is the bliss of being alone, the art of being alone. When you are blissful in your aloneness there is no limit, nobody to interfere, nobody to encroach. You have the whole sky to yourself.\nOnce you have experienced this bliss which comes through being absolutely alone, then you can enjoy even the first kind of bliss which comes through love, because then two lovers can be together and yet not interfere with each other's aloneness. That is true love, not to interfere in the other's aloneness, to give him total freedom,,not to possess, not to dominate, not to reduce the other to a thing to be used -- into a means to be used. But that is possible only for a meditator. When two meditators love then love and meditation are no more different; then they are two aspects of the same bliss. But this has not happened up to now.\nMeditators have been afraid of love. They escape to monasteries in the mountains. In fact they are escaping from the other, afraid that they may be caught. They know themselves, they have experienced something of love -- and they are afraid they may be trapped again in some relationship so they are escaping to the deserts, to the mountains. There they may be able to have a certain peace and calmness and a certain joy -- but it will be only half, it will not give them the wholeness.\nAnd there are people in the world who never bother about meditation. In fact they are afraid of meditation because they think meditators become life- renouncers and they don't want to renounce their wife, their children, their husbands their family. They don't want to renounce so they are afraid of meditation.\nI have come across both kinds of people but both are half, and to be half is to be miserable, to be whole is to be really blissful. To be whole is to be holy. But one should start with meditation. One should first be able to be happy on one's own. Then there is no dependence, then there is no need to depend on anybody; you can be happy on your own -- but still you would like to share your joy.\nI am doing many things here in my commune with my sannyasins, many experiments. One of the experiments is to make them all meditators and lovers so that they can start a new kind of religiousness in the world, so they can make aloneness and love go together, dancing in deep harmony.\n-- How long will you be here?\n-- I go back tomorrow.\n-- Then come back again the day after tomorrow (laughter) or any day after tomorrow, but come back!\nECST-NEST-Y\n(Bliss is our home, Osho is to make of Anand Horst's name. First, a brief exchange.)\n-- What is the meaning of your name?\n-- I don't know -- maybe 'nest' in German.\n-- Yes, that's my feeling! I asked Nandan (a medium, she is sitting to Osho's right) -- she is a German -- and she said it means a small forest. In fact her name means a small forest; Nandan means a small forest. I was suspicious... Horst certainly means nest, it means home. That's good! (There is a ripple of laughter and Nandan grins to herself. Osho pops the mala over Horst's head and touched his third eye.) Just look at me.\n(Then Osho shows Horst his new name. He talks to him about how we only feel at home when we're happy.)\nSannyas is a deliberate search for bliss, for the real home. And unless you deliberately seek and search for bliss you will not find it. You may come across it many times but you will not be able to recognise it unless you are consciously looking for it.\nWe only see that which we are looking for -- remember this. Now the scientists say that only two per cent of information goes through the eyes; ninety -- eight percent is debarred, rejected, censored. for the simple reason that your eyes don't want your head to be overloaded. It is already overloaded. If all the information goes in within twenty-four hours you will go cuckoo. It has to be prevented. So only that which you are seeking and searching for is allowed. It is an inbuilt process.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nFor example, many people pass along the street, the same street, every day, but they all look at different things. The street is the same -- the houses, the trees, the people, everything is the same, but they all see different things. A thief passing on the street will be focussed on the policeman, he will not look at anybody else but the policeman will immediately enter his mind, because he is afraid and alert. The hungry person will only look at the hotels and the restaurants -- but the person who is not hungry may not look at the hotels and the restaurants at all. The person who has lived without any sexual repression may not look at women or men, but the celibate, the monk, the nun -- the people who have taken the vow of repressing their sexuality\n-- will look only at women and men. Their whole interest will be there -- nothing else will enter their minds.\nSo remember it, we find only that for which we are looking. And bliss is possible. It comes each moment but you never recognise it because you are running after money, power, prestige -- who cares about bliss? You say 'We will see about bliss when we retire, this is not the time.' But by the time you retire you have become so accustomed to running after power, prestige, money, that now you cannot look at bliss; it has become a life-long habit to overlook it, not to recognise it. Habits die very hard.\nSo it has to become a deliberate search. From this moment look for bliss in every possible opportunity.\nFor example, right now if you become silent then the sound of the insects and the silence of the night...\nand suddenly a breeze of bliss, suddenly it is there. You start falling into a restful moment. Something settles -- a pause, an interval -- and you can recognise that this is a beautiful moment.\nJust go on watching, go on deliberately looking for it. And it is not very far away, it is just around the corner.\nMIND YOUR BUSY-NESS\n(Because there are certain things you can only know when you've got plenty of time.) For them there is no short-cut. And all that is great belongs to that category. Only small things can be attained quickly. Coffee can be instant -- -- love cannot be. Instant love cannot be love. Instant simply means you are not even ready to pay the little patience for it.\nOne should learn to be patient -- to be ready to wait with open doors, with a welcoming heart, but not in a hurry, not demanding, not forcing things. And the miracle, the paradox, is that the less you force things, the more quickly they happen. The more you force them, the longer it takes.\nBecause meditation has to be learned -- and meditation only means stilling of the mind, the silencing of the mind -- you cannot be in a hurry. If you are in a hurry your mind will remain in a turmoil. You will be jumping ahead of yourself, you will be so interested in the result that you will not be able to give total attention to the present -- you will be looking at the future. And the meditator has to be in the present; he has to forget all about the future, all about ends and results. He has to be so attuned, so in an at onement with existence right now that he is not concerned With anything else. Of course this is possible only if one is patient.\nThe word 'patience' became associated with the ill people; we call them 'patients'. It became associated with ill people, with sick people, for a certain reasons healing cannot be forced, you have to wait -- you have to allow nature to work. All that medicine does is to help you to wait, it gives you hope to wait.\nThey say that the common cold is cured within seven days if you don't take any medicine, and it is cured in one week if you take medicine. Medicine does not make much difference, the cold takes its own time, but if you don't take medicine then those seven days look very long. Medicine helps you to hope that you are doing whatsoever needs to be done. And the more famous your doctor is... The more you have to pay for the doctor and the hospital, the better, because it gives you more hope and in hope you can wait, you can be patient. That's why the word 'patient' became synonymous with the ill person. And in a sense we are all ill, ill without god, sick without god. We are carrying wounds and they all need to be healed.\nReligion is a healing process, spiritual healing. One has to be patient, so much so\nthat one need not bother about the result. One should be in the present, in the now, in the here, and in deep trust that whenever the time is ripe it is going to happen, it has nothing to do with you.\nOne of the greatest statements of Krishna in Gita is s Do the work and leave the result to god; that is none of your business. Action is your business and the result is god's.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nESSENCE D'ENLIGHTENMENT\nMan can stink, man can also be fragrant. It all depends on how you live, on how you approach life. If one never learns the art of living life stinks stinks badly, because unless you learn the art of living you can't have grace, you can't have beauty, you can't have bliss, you can't have truth, you can't have love, and without all these experience, how can there be fragrance?\nOne comes with a great potential but very few people use that potential, it remains unused. And when water is dormant it starts stinking; any energy that remains dormant goes sour -- it needs dynamic flow. One should be more like a river than like a pond.\nMy sannyasins have to become dynamic, always moving, moving into the unknown, moving into the unfamiliar, always reaching for the stars. And then there is great fragrance. In the old days that fragrance was called god, nirvana, enlightenment. It is nothing but life blossoming.\nYOU'RE A ONE-FF\nEveryone is unique. God never duplicates, he never makes two people alike; he respects the individual.\nHe is not like an assembly line is the factory of a car manufacturer; he never\nrepeats. There has never been a person like you, there isn't now and there never will be again. This is god's way of paying respect to the individual.\nBut our society does not give any respect to the individual; it teaches you not to be yourself but somebody else. It teaches you to be a Jesus or a Buddha or a Krishna. That's why Christianity, Hinduism, Mohammedanism, exist. Society teaches you to be imitators, and when people become imitators they become ugly, pseudo, phony. Then they have a double personality: on the surface one thing, in the depth something else, just the opposite of it.\nMy sannyasins have to be simply one. You are not to be an imitation of anybody, you just have to be yourself. To accept oneself as one is the first step in growing, in becoming adult. To love oneself is the first step in loving god -- because this is the way he has made you -- To love his creation is to love the creator --\nand we are his creation. It is against god to be somebody else. Just be yourself.\nLove and respect yourself and never compromise for anything. And then you will be surprised how much growth starts happening of its own accord... as if rocks have been removed and the river has started flowing.\n(You've got to be one and to have won you your own truth. Osho is talking to another sannyasin.) Sannyas is courage, the courage to drop out of all traditions, the courage to discard all ideologies, the courage to renounce the whole past, the courage to start anew from ABC, as if you are born today.\nOnce these things are fulfilled you have started moving towards god, towards truth, because truth is not a tradition, not a convention, not a church, not a race. Truth cannot be delivered to you by the past. Nobody can give it to you, it has to be discovered by you and only by you. Unless the truth is yours it is not true.\nTruth certainly liberates, as Jesus says, but I would like to make a condition to that statement; truth liberates only when it is your own. If it is somebody else's it binds you, it never liberates.\nEXISTENTIAL EQUATION\nMan appears very small from the outside, but if you look at yourself from your own centre, from inside, you are as infinite as the sky itself. You are eternal -- - no beginning, no end, no birth, no death. But a very funny and strange thing is\nthat we know ourselves only through a mirror. If others know us only from the outside that is understandable because they cannot enter into your centre, that is not possible, nobody can become part )of your interiority. So they look at you from the outside -- that's perfectly right. They only know your boundary, and that boundary is not really yours but your body's. But the strange thing is that we look at ourselves through a mirror.\nLooking through a mirror means looking at yourself from outside. While you can stand within you are 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\ntrying to look at yourself as others look at you. That is why we create a very wrong notion of ourselves.\nWhen Socrates and people like him say, 'Know thyself' they are saying drop the mirror, close your eyes, go within and see from there. And that's what mean by meditation: go within and see from there, only then will you know your skylike consciousness. And once you have tasted of it, that oceanic experience, all misery disappears, all darkness disappears; suddenly you are part of god himself.\nOne of the great disciples of George Gurdjieff, P.D. Ouspensky, has written a very beautiful statement.\nOn the surface it is illogical. He says that the part can never be equal to the whole. It is obvious, simple arithmetic, that the part can never be equal to the whole. How can my finger be equal to the whole of me? --\nthe part is bound to be smaller than the whole. But Ouspensky says there is an inner experience where the part is equal to the whole, exactly equal to the whole. Now that is illogical, beyond mathematics, but certainly true.\nWhen you know yourself from inside suddenly you are not only part of god, you are god. The part is equal to the whole. hence the declaration of the Upanishads 'Aham Brahmasmi' -- I am god. It has nothing to do with ego, it is a simple statement of an inner reality.\nGoing All the Way Chapter #18\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"4367","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/going_all_the_way/part17/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/going_all_the_way/>Going All The Way</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>21 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;4367 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Going_All_The_Way/part17.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part16>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

diary, which has been scanned and cleaned up. It is for reference
purposes only.]</p><p>THAT WHICH BRINGS US TOGETHER SETS US APART</p><p>(It is called love -- and animals can't do it.)</p><p>Aristotle and others who define man as a rational animal are not
right -- because reason is not his distinction. Other animals also have
reason, maybe a little less -</p><p>- but the difference is only of degree; there is no qualitative
difference. And now we know that even machines can have intelligence,
computers can have intelligence.</p><p>A computer is more rational than any man can ever be, more rational
than Aristotle himself. Aristotle was not very rational. He had two
wives -- now, a</p><p>rational person cannot even have one -- -- and for his whole life he
was tortured by two women. One is enough, in fact more than enough; to
be pulled by two is not a very rational decision. And he writes in books
a thousand and one irrational things.</p><p>One of the most irrational things he writes is that women have less
teeth than men. He had two wives, he could have asked them or counted
their teeth; it would have been so simple an experiment. No laboratory,
no science was needed, just simple arithmetic, but he never bothered.
The idea was prevalent in Greece that women have less teeth. Obviously
they must have everything less than men. That is the male chauvinist
idea: everything should be less. How can they have an equal number of
teeth? That is irrational.</p><p>My observation is that love is the only quality that making man
different from everything else in existence. But very few men are
loving. So all men are not distinguished, they are ordinary. Only once
in a while a Christ -- a Buddha, a Lao Tzu, has experienced the ultimate
peak of love and they are the salt of the earth.</p><p>My sannyasins have to move deeper into the phenomenon of love, they
have to explore it in every possible way and they have to purify it of
all lust. They have to make it more and more close to prayer, and
ultimately it becomes just prayer.</p><p>When love is just a prayerfulness one has attained true humanity,
then one is really born_born as a man.</p><p>Before that one was only in the womb, asleep. To attain love is to be
a rake. CREATOR OR HATER</p><p>Love has immense power but a very different kind of power. We are
acquainted with the power of violence and aggression, we are acquainted
with the animal power -- destructive power. That's why we go on writing
history about Alexander the Great and Genghis Khan and Tamerlane and
Nadir Shah and Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin and so on and so forth.
These people have a certain power but that power is of violence,
aggression, destruction. It is against god, it is against existence.
These people are really criminals.</p><p>History needs to be rewritten, these people should be completely
dropped out of history as if they never existed. Children should not be
poisoned with their</p><p>names.</p><p>History should be concerned with Gautam the Buddha, Jesus Christ,
Zarathustra, Krishna, Kabir, Meera, Rabiya -- men and women of love.
They also have a power but that is a totally different kind of power, it
creates. To destroy is very easy. Any child can do it, any fool can do
it, it needs no intelligence. But to create needs great intelligence. It
can be done only by people who experience beauty, truth, love.</p><p>To be creative means to be part of god because god is the creator, to
create means to participate in his creativity -- and that -- q the power
of love. The man of love always creates. Poetry -- music, painting, or
whatsoever he does is creative. And the man of creativity slowly slowly
learns about love.</p><p>But my approach is to start from love because that is the centre, and
creativity is the circumference. If the centre is there the
circumference will happen automatically, but to create first and then to
move towards love, is a far long process. It may take lives and even
then there is no certainty -- because each time you die 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>you lose whatsoever you have attained on the circumference -- because
each life will give you a different circumference,,only the centre
remains the same. So whatsoever we attain at the centre of our being
becomes ours forever, death cannot destroy it -- it will be with you in
the new life. It goes on accumulating; circumferences go on changing
every life. So many times people create much on the circumference but
they lose it again and again.</p><p>My whole effort here is to start from the centre itself, only then
are you on the right track. Love and let love become creativity in your
life. That is my whole religion. Love plus creativity is equal to
religion.</p><p>TRUE RELIGION: AESTHETICISM, NOT ASCETICISM</p><p>Beauty is the most godly experience. One should not think about god
in terms of</p><p>theology -- that is the wrong route, an absolutely wrong route. One
should think aesthetically about god, and to think aesthetically really
means to feel. You cannot think aesthetically, you can only feel. Beauty
is felt, not thought. You don't <em>think</em> that the sunset is
beautiful, you <em>know</em>, you <em>feel</em>; that's why you cannot
prove it to others. If somebody denies it there is no way to prove that
it really is beautiful. If somebody says the rose flower is not
beautiful what can be done? We can feel sorry for him but we cannot help
him to experience the beauty of the rose.</p><p>He is not available to the rose, his heart is not open to the
rose.</p><p>There are millions of people who have not experienced beauty and
whatsoever they think is beauty is nothing but biological lust. If a man
thinks that only a woman can be beautiful and never bothers about the
sunrise or the flowers or a bird on the wing or the clouds or the stars,
he does not know anything of the woman either. It is only the hormonal,
the instinctive, the unconscious in him, which makes him clouded,
infatuated, and which makes him think the woman is beautiful -- that is
not the experience of beauty.</p><p>The experience of beauty has nothing to do with biology, it has
something aesthetic. And when you know the aesthetics of beauty then
certainly a woman, a man, the trees, the clouds, the mountains... then
the whole universe is involved in it. And to experience beauty in all
its forms is to feel god. That's why I say beauty is the most divine
experience.</p><p>Become available to beauty in all its forms. Open up open as many
doors and windows as possible. The more you know of beauty, the more you
will know of god. And the beautiful thing about this experience is that
you will not become a Christian or a Hindu or a Mohammedan because you
are not going via theology; you are approaching god directly, not via
the priests. The priest poisons. He is the greatest poisoner, the
greatest curse that has ever happened to humanity. The priest has to be
avoided like the plague.</p><p>Humanity will be in a far more superior position when the priests
become something of the past, just part of history. You can save a few
for the museums and zoos, etcetera but they should not be part of
humanity any more. Pope the Polack will look very beautiful in a zoo
(laughter). People can watch, just as they watch the hippopotamus, and
they can ask what kind of animal this is? -- and that will be perfectly
okay. But priests should not be allowed to dominate</p><p>humanity any more; they have done enough harm.</p><p>The best way to destroy the whole strategy, the whole trade secret of
the priest is to make man some direct route that he can follow towards
god. And my observation is that the aesthetic experience is the most
immediate. It needs no via media, no mediator -- it is immediate, it
overwhelms one.</p><p>(And bliss is about as aesthetic as you can be. Osho goes on to talk
to Anand Monika about the two ways in which you can come to know
bliss.)</p><p>There are two kinds of blissful experiences: one is of love, the
other is of meditation.</p><p>Love needs at least two people, it is a dialogue between two
energies. But because the other is needed there is a limitation, it
cannot be infinite. And because the other is needed there is a certain
kind of dependence; hence lovers love each other but deep do, they
cannot forgive each other. They ca}mot forgive the other because they
have become dependent, hence the constant quarrelling between lovers. It
is very significant s why do lovers go on quarrelling? They should be
the last to quarrel, but they are the topmost quarrellers. Even enemies
don't quarrel that much, in fact they don't meet! And lovers are
together twenty- four hours a day, at each other's neck, fighting tooth
and nail. Only once and a while are there love-breaks, otherwise they
are wrestling; they are intimate enemies.</p><p>The reason for their enmity is very subtle and unconscious -- it is
the dependence. Nobody likes to be dependent on anybody else because
freedom is the highest value of life. But if you want the joy of love
you have to compromise and that compromise hurts. The other starts
encroaching on your space, you start 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>encroaching on the other's space.</p><p>Love is one kind of joy, but it is a very limited phenomenon. Unless
one has</p><p>known the other kind of bliss... and that rarely happens. That comes
through meditation. Meditation is the bliss of being alone, the art of
being alone. When you are blissful in your aloneness there is no limit,
nobody to interfere, nobody to encroach. You have the whole sky to
yourself.</p><p>Once you have experienced this bliss which comes through being
absolutely alone, then you can enjoy even the first kind of bliss which
comes through love, because then two lovers can be together and yet not
interfere with each other's aloneness. That is true love, not to
interfere in the other's aloneness, to give him total freedom,,not to
possess, not to dominate, not to reduce the other to a thing to be used
-- into a means to be used. But that is possible only for a meditator.
When two meditators love then love and meditation are no more different;
then they are two aspects of the same bliss. But this has not happened
up to now.</p><p>Meditators have been afraid of love. They escape to monasteries in
the mountains. In fact they are escaping from the other, afraid that
they may be caught. They know themselves, they have experienced
something of love -- and they are afraid they may be trapped again in
some relationship so they are escaping to the deserts, to the mountains.
There they may be able to have a certain peace and calmness and a
certain joy -- but it will be only half, it will not give them the
wholeness.</p><p>And there are people in the world who never bother about meditation.
In fact they are afraid of meditation because they think meditators
become life- renouncers and they don't want to renounce their wife,
their children, their husbands their family. They don't want to renounce
so they are afraid of meditation.</p><p>I have come across both kinds of people but both are half, and to be
half is to be miserable, to be whole is to be really blissful. To be
whole is to be holy. But one should start with meditation. One should
first be able to be happy on one's own. Then there is no dependence,
then there is no need to depend on anybody; you can be happy on your own
-- but still you would like to share your joy.</p><p>I am doing many things here in my commune with my sannyasins, many
experiments. One of the experiments is to make them all meditators and
lovers so that they can start a new kind of religiousness in the world,
so they can make aloneness and love go together, dancing in deep
harmony.</p><p>-- How long will you be here?</p><p>-- I go back tomorrow.</p><p>-- Then come back again the day after tomorrow (laughter) or any day
after tomorrow, but come back!</p><p>ECST-NEST-Y</p><p>(Bliss is our home, Osho is to make of Anand Horst's name. First, a
brief exchange.)</p><p>-- What is the meaning of your name?</p><p>-- I don't know -- maybe 'nest' in German.</p><p>-- Yes, that's my feeling! I asked Nandan (a medium, she is sitting
to Osho's right) -- she is a German -- and she said it means a small
forest. In fact her name means a small forest; Nandan means a small
forest. I was suspicious... Horst certainly means nest, it means home.
That's good! (There is a ripple of laughter and Nandan grins to herself.
Osho pops the mala over Horst's head and touched his third eye.) Just
look at me.</p><p>(Then Osho shows Horst his new name. He talks to him about how we
only feel at home when we're happy.)</p><p>Sannyas is a deliberate search for bliss, for the real home. And
unless you deliberately seek and search for bliss you will not find it.
You may come across it many times but you will not be able to recognise
it unless you are consciously looking for it.</p><p>We only see that which we are looking for -- remember this. Now the
scientists say that only two per cent of information goes through the
eyes; ninety -- eight percent is debarred, rejected, censored. for the
simple reason that your eyes don't want your head to be overloaded. It
is already overloaded. If all the information goes in within twenty-four
hours you will go cuckoo. It has to be prevented. So only that which you
are seeking and searching for is allowed. It is an inbuilt process.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>For example, many people pass along the street, the same street,
every day, but they all look at different things. The street is the same
-- the houses, the trees, the people, everything is the same, but they
all see different things. A thief passing on the street will be focussed
on the policeman, he will not look at anybody else but the policeman
will immediately enter his mind, because he is afraid and alert. The
hungry person will only look at the hotels and the restaurants -- but
the person who is not hungry may not look at the hotels and the
restaurants at all. The person who has lived without any sexual
repression may not look at women or men, but the celibate, the monk, the
nun -- the people who have taken the vow of repressing their
sexuality</p><p>-- will look only at women and men. Their whole interest will be
there -- nothing else will enter their minds.</p><p>So remember it, we find only that for which we are looking. And bliss
is possible. It comes each moment but you never recognise it because you
are running after money, power, prestige -- who cares about bliss? You
say 'We will see about bliss when we retire, this is not the time.' But
by the time you retire you have become so accustomed to running after
power, prestige, money, that now you cannot look at bliss; it has become
a life-long habit to overlook it, not to recognise it. Habits die very
hard.</p><p>So it has to become a deliberate search. From this moment look for
bliss in every possible opportunity.</p><p>For example, right now if you become silent then the sound of the
insects and the silence of the night...</p><p>and suddenly a breeze of bliss, suddenly it is there. You start
falling into a restful moment. Something settles -- a pause, an interval
-- and you can recognise that this is a beautiful moment.</p><p>Just go on watching, go on deliberately looking for it. And it is not
very far away, it is just around the corner.</p><p>MIND YOUR BUSY-NESS</p><p>(Because there are certain things you can only know when you've got
plenty of time.) For them there is no short-cut. And all that is great
belongs to that category. Only small things can be attained quickly.
Coffee can be instant -- -- love cannot be. Instant love cannot be love.
Instant simply means you are not even ready to pay the little patience
for it.</p><p>One should learn to be patient -- to be ready to wait with open
doors, with a welcoming heart, but not in a hurry, not demanding, not
forcing things. And the miracle, the paradox, is that the less you force
things, the more quickly they happen. The more you force them, the
longer it takes.</p><p>Because meditation has to be learned -- and meditation only means
stilling of the mind, the silencing of the mind -- you cannot be in a
hurry. If you are in a hurry your mind will remain in a turmoil. You
will be jumping ahead of yourself, you will be so interested in the
result that you will not be able to give total attention to the present
-- you will be looking at the future. And the meditator has to be in the
present; he has to forget all about the future, all about ends and
results. He has to be so attuned, so in an at onement with existence
right now that he is not concerned With anything else. Of course this is
possible only if one is patient.</p><p>The word 'patience' became associated with the ill people; we call
them 'patients'. It became associated with ill people, with sick people,
for a certain reasons healing cannot be forced, you have to wait -- you
have to allow nature to work. All that medicine does is to help you to
wait, it gives you hope to wait.</p><p>They say that the common cold is cured within seven days if you don't
take any medicine, and it is cured in one week if you take medicine.
Medicine does not make much difference, the cold takes its own time, but
if you don't take medicine then those seven days look very long.
Medicine helps you to hope that you are doing whatsoever needs to be
done. And the more famous your doctor is... The more you have to pay for
the doctor and the hospital, the better, because it gives you more hope
and in hope you can wait, you can be patient. That's why the word
'patient' became synonymous with the ill person. And in a sense we are
all ill, ill without god, sick without god. We are carrying wounds and
they all need to be healed.</p><p>Religion is a healing process, spiritual healing. One has to be
patient, so much so</p><p>that one need not bother about the result. One should be in the
present, in the now, in the here, and in deep trust that whenever the
time is ripe it is going to happen, it has nothing to do with you.</p><p>One of the greatest statements of Krishna in Gita is s Do the work
and leave the result to god; that is none of your business. Action is
your business and the result is god's.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-4>Osho's books on

live, on how you approach life. If one never learns the art of living
life stinks stinks badly, because unless you learn the art of living you
can't have grace, you can't have beauty, you can't have bliss, you can't
have truth, you can't have love, and without all these experience, how
can there be fragrance?</p><p>One comes with a great potential but very few people use that
potential, it remains unused. And when water is dormant it starts
stinking; any energy that remains dormant goes sour -- it needs dynamic
flow. One should be more like a river than like a pond.</p><p>My sannyasins have to become dynamic, always moving, moving into the
unknown, moving into the unfamiliar, always reaching for the stars. And
then there is great fragrance. In the old days that fragrance was called
god, nirvana, enlightenment. It is nothing but life blossoming.</p><p>YOU'RE A ONE-FF</p><p>Everyone is unique. God never duplicates, he never makes two people
alike; he respects the individual.</p><p>He is not like an assembly line is the factory of a car manufacturer;
he never</p><p>repeats. There has never been a person like you, there isn't now and
there never will be again. This is god's way of paying respect to the
individual.</p><p>But our society does not give any respect to the individual; it
teaches you not to be yourself but somebody else. It teaches you to be a
Jesus or a Buddha or a Krishna. That's why Christianity, Hinduism,
Mohammedanism, exist. Society teaches you to be imitators, and when
people become imitators they become ugly, pseudo, phony. Then they have
a double personality: on the surface one thing, in the depth something
else, just the opposite of it.</p><p>My sannyasins have to be simply one. You are not to be an imitation
of anybody, you just have to be yourself. To accept oneself as one is
the first step in growing, in becoming adult. To love oneself is the
first step in loving god -- because this is the way he has made you --
To love his creation is to love the creator --</p><p>and we are his creation. It is against god to be somebody else. Just
be yourself.</p><p>Love and respect yourself and never compromise for anything. And then
you will be surprised how much growth starts happening of its own
accord... as if rocks have been removed and the river has started
flowing.</p><p>(You've got to be one and to have won you your <em>own</em> truth.
Osho is talking to another sannyasin.) Sannyas is courage, the courage
to drop out of all traditions, the courage to discard all ideologies,
the courage to renounce the whole past, the courage to start anew from
ABC, as if you are born today.</p><p>Once these things are fulfilled you have started moving towards god,
towards truth, because truth is not a tradition, not a convention, not a
church, not a race. Truth cannot be delivered to you by the past. Nobody
can give it to you, it has to be discovered by you and only by you.
Unless the truth is yours it is not true.</p><p>Truth certainly liberates, as Jesus says, but I would like to make a
condition to that statement; truth liberates only when it is your own.
If it is somebody else's it binds you, it never liberates.</p><p>EXISTENTIAL EQUATION</p><p>Man appears very small from the outside, but if you look at yourself
from your own centre, from inside, you are as infinite as the sky
itself. You are eternal -- - no beginning, no end, no birth, no death.
But a very funny and strange thing is</p><p>that we know ourselves only through a mirror. If others know us only
from the outside that is understandable because they cannot enter into
your centre, that is not possible, nobody can become part )of your
interiority. So they look at you from the outside -- that's perfectly
right. They only know your boundary, and that boundary is not really
yours but your body's. But the strange thing is that we look at
<em>ourselves</em> through a mirror.</p><p>Looking through a mirror means looking at yourself from outside.

create a very wrong notion of ourselves.</p><p>When Socrates and people like him say, 'Know thyself' they are saying
drop the mirror, close your eyes, go within and see from there. And
that's what mean by meditation: go within and see from there, only then
will you know your skylike consciousness. And once you have tasted of
it, that oceanic experience, all misery disappears, all darkness
disappears; suddenly you are part of god himself.</p><p>One of the great disciples of George Gurdjieff, P.D. Ouspensky, has
written a very beautiful statement.</p><p>On the surface it is illogical. He says that the part can never be
equal to the whole. It is obvious, simple arithmetic, that the part can
never be equal to the whole. How can my finger be equal to the whole of

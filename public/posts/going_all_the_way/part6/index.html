They don't have any real value; they have a price but no value. So this is one of the most significant criterions to judge what is essential and what is non-essential: the non-essential can be purchased, can be sold; it is a commodity. The essential is not a commodity. It can neither be sold nor purchased; it has to be grown in one's being, it is a growth.\nNow, a child cannot purchase youth he has to grow. The young man cannot purchase old age, he has to grow. The old man cannot purchase wisdom. We may\nhave lived long and yet he may not have grown inwardly. Growing in age is not really growing up.\nSannyas means making a clear-cut discrimination between the non-essential and the essential and focussing your energy on the essential. The non-essential is needed, it has a certain utility; you need food, you need clothes, you need a shelter -- make arrangements for them. But that's not all, that is only the peripheral.\nDon't sacrifice the essential for the non-essential. The non-essential can always be sacrificed for the essential and then one is not going to be a loser.\nBliss is one of those most significant treasures which have to be grown within you. And the most strange thing is that all that is needed to grow into a blissful state is available. It comes with you with birth.\nAll that is needed is a turning in to look for it, to search for it, to give it an opportunity. Attention is nourishment. When you pay attention to your inner world it starts growing, it is nourished. And that's the whole art of meditation, the art of turning in.\nCOMBAT OR CONCERTO\n(Whether you flow or fight with god makes no difference to him but it is going to affect you.) Fighting with god is like hitting your head against the wall: it is not going to do any harm to the wall, only your head will be destroyed. You will lose your sanity. To be in tune with god means to find a door.\nYou can go through it and then there is no need to fight with the wall. The wall is not your enemy, it protects you. And there is always a door.\nIt is childish to fight with existence because existence is vast and we are so small that our fight is doomed, from the very beginning we are going to lose it. It is not possible in the nature of thing, that we will ever win. But there is a way to be victorious too and that is, fighting in tune with god, not against him but for him. And when the whole thing changes, the whole gestalt changes, when you are fighting for god you start fighting with your own unconsciousness, with your own anger, jealousy, possessiveness, greed; then you are really entering into a fight with all that is not needed for your inner growth but which is a hindrance. You are discarding all that is a hindrance and allowing the whole to penetrate\nyou, to flood you.\nConsecrated to god means to become a vehicle for god, to be a medium of god. And the greatest barrier is the ego. One has to put aside the ego, and then there is no problem. The surrender comes very easily, the let-go happens just like breathing, there is no effort needed. It happens like falling into sleep or waking up in the morning -- just a natural phenomenon, spontaneous.\nAnd when one is in a deep let-go with the whole the consequence is bliss. It is a by-product, it is a reward, but an inevitable reward. The surrendered person has tremendous blissfulness around him, within and without. He knows nothing else, no other taste, only the taste of blissfulness.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nSannyas has to become the beginning of surrendering. In the beginning of course one surrenders only hesitantly, only calculatively, bit by bit. One watches what happens -- if you surrender so much, what happens? But as you surrender you start opening up windows towards the starry sky, then sooner or later you will be able to surrender all. The moment all is surrendered, all is achieved. It is a paradox; the moment you lose everything to god, you gain everything that you always wanted to gain. But it does hot come through fight, this victory comes through love, through trust.\nFROM THE SOIL OF SILENCE...\n(... and the air of awareness, comes the fragrance of the eternal. Osho initiates Italian sannyasin Dhyan Mariano.)\nIt is not something that comes and goes, it only comes and never goes. And unless one has known that fragrance one has not known what life is all about. One only lives unconsciously, not knowing why one is, what one is, from where one has come, to where one is going. One goes on stumbling in a deeply drunken state. Then life is accidental, and an accidental life is a meaningless life.\nThe moment you become silently aware a radical change happens, a change from your vary roots. That is exactly the meaning of the word 'radical' -- it is not just the pruning of the branches and the leaves but the change of your very roots. For the first time you become aware that you are not the body, not the mind, not even the heart; you are just a witness to all. That witnessing begins the journey in god, that witnessing changes you. The world remains the same but because you are no more the same it also changes -- at least for you. It suddenly becomes psychedelically beautiful. It starts having a new intensity, a new fervour, a new dance. And to live that intensity, that dance, that passion, is to know what it means to be alive.\nVery few people have known it, although it is everybody's birthright. How long will you be here?\n(His reply is inaudible save to Osho.)\nThen come back again for a longer period. This is not very Italian. Come back soon!\nFREEDOM'S JUST ANOTHER WORD FOR NO MIND LEFT TO LOSE\n(Osho is talking to Amano Francesco.)\nAmano means no-mind. That's the most fundamental thing in sannyas, the capacity to put the mind aside and to look directly into life with nothing interfering -- no prejudice, no thought, no philosophy, no religion\n-- to look into life without any a priori conclusion, just like a mirror simply reflecting that which is. That is the state of Amano. Zen people call it no-mind, and no-mind is the door to the divine.\nIt is the same door, only the direction changes. If you go outwards it is mind, if you go inwards it is no-mind. If you want to know the world then you have to use the mind, if your enquiry is scientific or philosophic, then the mind is a must. But if your enquiry is mystical, spiritual, religious, if you want to know yourself, if you are trying to explore your own interiority, then no-mind is a must.\nAnd Francesco means a free man. The man who is clouded by the mind is the unfree man; then he is a Christian or a Hindu or a Mohammedan -- because mind\nmeans either you belong to this religion or to that.\nThen one is communist, fascist, socialist, then one can be theist, atheist, and there are a thousand and one ideologies -- religious, philosophical, social, economical -and all these are chains, very subtle chains. You will find everybody a prisoner of something or other.\nEven the idea of nations makes people prisoners. The Indian is imprisoned in his past, the Italian is imprisoned in his tradition, the Chinese is imprisoned in his -- the whole five thousand years of thinking and philosophising. Nations are prisons, races are prisons, the idea of the white man and the black man -- that too is a prison. And they are very stupid kinds of prisons, because between the white man and the black man there is only a little difference of colour pigment; not more than four annas worth, one-fourth of a rupee --\nand that too is in favour of the black man because he has more pigment than the white man. He needs a certain pigment in his skin to protect him from the sun. Just four annas worth of pigment is creating so much nonsense in the world.\nAll these things have to be put aside, then you are in a state of no-mind and then you are also free. And to have the taste of freedom is the most beautiful thing in life. It is another name for god. In fact, one of the 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\ngreatest enlightened masters of the East, Mahavira, never used the word 'god'.\nHe always used the word\n'freedom' for god. And I can understand why he insisted on using the word 'freedom', 'moksha', because even the idea of god becomes an imprisonment, because it divides people into the people who believe in god and the people who don't believe in god. But you cannot find a person who does not long for freedom.\nFreedom is our most intrinsic longing, the deepest longing of the heart. It can be achieved only by the process of no-mind. You can call it meditation, awareness,\nsilence -- these are different names for the same phenomenon. LOVE IS EGOCIDE\n(Osho tells Premdaya that a sympathy that doesn't stem from love is simply ego- fodder.) If you are in a certain kind of suffering you will find many people sympathizing with you and if you look into their eyes you will be puzzled; they are saying one thing -- they are very sympathetic towards you\n-- but their eyes are showing something else; they are enjoying it. And there is a subtle mechanism in it.\nWhen you sympathize with somebody you are higher and the person you are sympathizing with is lower, and everybody enjoys feeling higher in some way.\nFor example, if your house is burned down the whole neighborhood will come to sympathize with you.\nBut if you make a beautiful house nobody will come to appreciate it; they will all feel jealous. Strange! If they really feel sympathy when your house gets burned down they should feel very happy, they should celebrate, when you make a new home. But they don't celebrate, and that makes things clear; they are not really happy in your happiness, they are happy in your misery.\nSo sympathy to me is ugly if it is not rooted in love. It is beautiful if it is rooted in love. So love to me is a revolutionary phenomenon; it changes sympathy into something totally different to what it is. Sympathy should not be because people are in sorrow, sympathy should be because you are too full of love and you want to share it. Then there will be a great difference, you will rejoice when they are happy and you will feel sad when they are unhappy. You will not feel happy when they are sad and you will not feel jealous when they are happy; their happiness will be your happiness and their sadness will be your sadness.\nOnce Gautam the Buddha was asked, \"What is more difficult? -- to feel sad when somebody is sad or to feel happy when somebody is happy.\" And Buddha said the second thing is more difficult; the first thing is not difficult. One can feel sad when others are sad because deep down one can enjoy it, but when others are happy, to celebrate, to really celebrate, is very difficult -- it goes against our ego. Hence my emphasis is on love because love basically requires that you drop the ego. Love kills the ego, and when there is no ego then love can blossom in many\nflowers; sympathy is one of those flowers. But it is no more plastic then, it has its source in love.\nThe Christian missionaries going around the world and serving poor people are all living out of sympathy; their service is not out of love, not at all. It is cunning, it is very calculated. They are serving the poor people because they want to enjoy the pleasures of heaven. They are not concerned about the poor people, their whole concern is to use them as a ladder to reach heaven. And not only that, they are serving the poor people to convert them into their religion. It is a political game.\nEven a woman like Mother Teresa of Calcutta who has been serving orphans for her whole life and helps the orphan children to be adopted by families... but the subtle trick is that those children are given only to Catholic families, not to anybody else -- not even to a Protestant family, although they are also Christians.\nJust a few days ago a Protestant couple reached Calcutta and because they don't have any children, they wanted to adopt a child. They were refused because they were not Catholic. So it is not a question of serving the orphans, it is really a strategy to exploit poor people, their children, to convert them into Christianity. It is buying people, purchasing people, it is using people as commodities.\nAnd these people who serve humanity are respected very much, all kinds of honors are given to them.\nNobel prizes are given to them, and all the countries go on respecting them - and nobody looks at the subtle strategy that is behind all this service. It is cunning, it is ugly, it is nauseating.\nI don't teach my sannyasins to be servants of the people. Enough of that! These servants of people have been the most mischievous people in the world. Behind a beautiful name they have done immense harm. No more of this any longer.\nI teach simply love. Out of love if you feel to help, good, but that help will be out of your love, your joy.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThere is no reward, there is no question of attaining some pleasures in heaven, there is no question of converting somebody into a Hindu or a Christian or a Mohammedan.\nHindus are angry at me for the simple reason that they wanted me to convert all my sannyasins to Hinduism. Their anger is understandable. If I had converted all my sannyasins into Hindus then of course they would have respected me, they would have called me the greatest saint that has ever been here on the earth. Now I am the greatest sinner to them.\nJainas wanted me to spread Jainism over the whole world and they were ready to support me with as much money as I needed. I simply rejected the idea; I said, \"This is sheer nonsense you are talking to me. I cannot spread anybody's message. Why should I spread anybody's message? If your message has something in it people will come. I am not going to be anybody's missionary. I am just going to be my love and whosoever wants to partake of it is welcome. I never ask whether he is Christian or Hindu or Mohammedan.\nThat is not the question at all, that is not my business at all.\"\nOne should live out of one's love and for no other reason, then life becomes a beautiful phenomenon, music, a festivity.\nLOVE: THE OVERFLOW FROM THE LAKE ALONENESS ACCUMULATES\n(A balance is needed between being with others and loving, and being alone and blissful, Osho tells us.) Both enhance each other, both enrich each other. Your love makes you ready to go into aloneness, because one can be with people only for a certain time then the desire to be alone arises. It is a necessary phenomenon, a natural phenomenon.\nAnd when one is alone one can be alone only for a certain period because when one is alone one accumulates energy. It is not used, one becomes a reservoir and then one needs people to share it. That is what love is sharing the energy that becomes accumulated in your aloneness. But when you share your energy, when\nyou live with people, slowly you feel exhausted, tired, depleted; again the need has come to move into aloneness.\nIt is just like waking in the day and going to sleep in the night, for the whole day you are working, you feel tired and it is beautiful to feel tired. It has been a beautiful day of creativity; you worked in the sun, in the rain, in the wind, now you are ready to fall into deep sleep, to regain energy, to become ready again for work tomorrow.\nSo bliss is like sleep and love is like creativity. And my sannyasins have to fulfil both together; then the person is whole. A person who cannot sleep will go insane, and the person who cannot wake up will be in a coma, will be dead.\nSo both are needed: a deep capacity to go into sleep, into a dreamless sleep, and then immense energy to be creative. And they are not against each other, remember, they are complementary.\nAN ABSOLUTELY DEVICEFUL TIME\n(Osho speaks on Blissneyland.)\nA man without bliss is homeless, he is not at ease with existence, he is always tense, never relaxed. He is always full of anxiety and anguish. He does not know how to be in a let-go. Existence seems to be inimical to him; he cannot think of it as his home, he feels as n outsider. It is hiS own creation, this whole idea of being an outsider. Particularly in this century the idea that man is an outsider, is a stranger, that he does not belong to the world, that man is alienated, has become very dominant. All those ideas are simply wrong, but they look very solid, convincing, for the simple reason that man has forgotten how to be blissful.\nOnce you feel blissful you are no more an outsider, you are an insider. You are no more a stranger, you belong to this existence and this existence belongs to you. You are needed by existence and existence is needed by you. It is a mutual need.\nWe are partners in the same organic unity and everybody is essential; from the smallest blade of grass to the biggest star, everybody is needed, equally needed. There is no hierarchy in existence. The grass blade and the star have no inequality; they are equal. Existence supports them both in the same way, it makes no discrimination. To the sinners, to the saints, it is the same. The sun\nshines for all, the flowers bloom for all, the birds sing for all. It is our home! But without a taste of blissfulness it cannot be felt.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nSo my whole approach here is to help you to be cheerful, blissful, singing, dancing, creating all devices so that you can relax, come out of your conditioned sadness, seriousness, so that you can be children again, running on the sea beach collecting seashells, coloured stones, running after butterflies, collecting wild flowers with great wonder and awe.\nMy sannyasins are not seriously religious people -- sincerely religious but not seriously religious. They are playful, and playfulness is one of the most important things to understand. Life should be taken as fun, as a beautiful joke.\nThe movement you are capable of taking life as fun, as a beautiful joke, your vision changes. Suddenly you are at home, suddenly all is good, suddenly trees start saying 'hello' to you! Rocks start asking 'How are you?' (laughter) The whole existence becomes alive in a new sense, in a way it has never been before.\nUnless that happens a man is not enlightened, is not awakened to the ultimate truth. That is our goal.\nA CLOUD'S EYE VIEW\n(No particular place to go and no special way to be -- that's what a sannyasin has in common with a cloud.)\nThe metaphor of the cloud has to be understood. It will give you a few hints about blissfulness. The first thing about a cloud is that it has no direction, it is not destined towards any goal; it is simply floating. It is available to the winds wherever they take it, it is utterly relaxed. When you have a destination you are tense, you are worried about whether you are going to make it or not. And if the winds start blowing in the opposite direction then certainly there will be great\nanxiety. Rather than going towards the goal you are going against it.\nThe cloud has no goal so wherever the winds take it it is perfectly at ease. Wherever it finds itself that is its home. The same is true about bliss. A blissful person lives now and here, he has no desire to be somewhere else. Now is more than enough, he is utterly contented with it.\nSecondly, the cloud has no fixed form. It is constantly changing. One moment it looks like an elephant, the next moment it has become a camel, and it goes on changing. The same is true about bliss. It has no particular form; it is not a solid thing, it is flexible, so it can be found in all forms.\nYes, the man of understanding can find it in the body, in the mind, in the heart: in being. He can find it in himself, he can find it in others; he can find it in music, in poetry, in painting; he can find it in aloneness; he can find it in the mountains, he can find it in the marketplace.\nIt is not a fixed thing; rather it is an understanding, a sensibility, a sensitiveness, so one can feel it wherever it is.

diary, which has been scanned and cleaned up. It is for reference
purposes only.]</p><p>THE BEST THINGS IN LIFE ARE FREE</p><p>A person <em>who</em> wastes his life in accumulating things that can
be purchased is simply being stupid, because those are not the things
which can give meaning to your life. They don't have any real value;
they have a price but no value. So this is one of the most significant
criterions to judge what is essential and what is non-essential: the
non-essential can be purchased, can be sold; it is a commodity. The
essential is not a commodity. It can neither be sold nor purchased; it
has to be grown in one's being, it is a growth.</p><p>Now, a child cannot purchase youth he has to grow. The young man
cannot purchase old age, he has to grow. The old man cannot purchase
wisdom. We may</p><p>have lived long and yet he may not have grown inwardly. Growing in
age is not really growing up.</p><p>Sannyas means making a clear-cut discrimination between the
non-essential and the essential and focussing your energy on the
essential. The non-essential is needed, it has a certain utility; you
need food, you need clothes, you need a shelter -- make arrangements for
them. But that's not all, that is only the peripheral.</p><p>Don't sacrifice the essential for the non-essential. The
non-essential can always be sacrificed for the essential and then one is
not going to be a loser.</p><p>Bliss is one of those most significant treasures which have to be
grown within you. And the most strange thing is that all that is needed
to grow into a blissful state is available. It comes with you with
birth.</p><p>All that is needed is a turning in to look for it, to search for it,
to give it an opportunity. Attention is nourishment. When you pay
attention to your inner world it starts growing, it is nourished. And
that's the whole art of meditation, the art of turning in.</p><p>COMBAT OR CONCERTO</p><p>(Whether you flow or fight with god makes no difference to him but it
is going to affect you.) Fighting with god is like hitting your head
against the wall: it is not going to do any harm to the wall, only your
head will be destroyed. You will lose your sanity. To be in tune with
god means to find a door.</p><p>You can go through it and then there is no need to fight with the
wall. The wall is not your enemy, it protects you. And there is always a
door.</p><p>It is childish to fight with existence because existence is vast and
we are so small that our fight is doomed, from the very beginning we are
going to lose it. It is not possible in the nature of thing, that we
will ever win. But there is a way to be victorious too and that is,
fighting in tune with god, not against him but for him. And when the
whole thing changes, the whole gestalt changes, when you are fighting
for god you start fighting with your own unconsciousness, with your own
anger, jealousy, possessiveness, greed; then you are really entering
into a fight with all that is not needed for your inner growth but which
is a hindrance. You are discarding all that is a hindrance and allowing
the whole to penetrate</p><p>you, to flood you.</p><p>Consecrated to god means to become a vehicle for god, to be a medium
of god. And the greatest barrier is the ego. One has to put aside the
ego, and then there is no problem. The surrender comes very easily, the
let-go happens just like breathing, there is no effort needed. It
happens like falling into sleep or waking up in the morning -- just a
natural phenomenon, spontaneous.</p><p>And when one is in a deep let-go with the whole the consequence is
bliss. It is a by-product, it is a reward, but an inevitable reward. The
surrendered person has tremendous blissfulness around him, within and
without. He knows nothing else, no other taste, only the taste of
blissfulness.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>Sannyas has to become the beginning of surrendering. In the beginning
of course one surrenders only hesitantly, only calculatively, bit by
bit. One watches what happens -- if you surrender so much, what happens?
But as you surrender you start opening up windows towards the starry
sky, then sooner or later you will be able to surrender all. The moment
all is surrendered, all is achieved. It is a paradox; the moment you
lose everything to god, you gain everything that you always wanted to
gain. But it does hot come through fight, this victory comes through
love, through trust.</p><p>FROM THE SOIL OF SILENCE...</p><p>(... and the air of awareness, comes the fragrance of the eternal.
Osho initiates Italian sannyasin Dhyan Mariano.)</p><p>It is not something that comes and goes, it only comes and never
goes. And unless one has known that fragrance one has not known what
life is all about. One only lives unconsciously, not knowing why one is,
what one is, from where one has come, to where one is going. One goes on
stumbling in a deeply drunken state. Then life is accidental, and an
accidental life is a meaningless life.</p><p>The moment you become silently aware a radical change happens, a
change from your vary roots. That is exactly the meaning of the word
'radical' -- it is not just the pruning of the branches and the leaves
but the change of your very roots. For the first time you become aware
that you are not the body, not the mind, not even the heart; you are
just a witness to all. That witnessing begins the journey in god, that
witnessing changes you. The world remains the same but because you are
no more the same it also changes -- at least for you. It suddenly
becomes psychedelically beautiful. It starts having a new intensity, a
new fervour, a new dance. And to live that intensity, that dance, that
passion, is to know what it means to be alive.</p><p>Very few people have known it, although it is everybody's birthright.
How long will you be here?</p><p>(His reply is inaudible save to Osho.)</p><p>Then come back again for a longer period. This is not very Italian.
Come back soon!</p><p>FREEDOM'S JUST ANOTHER WORD FOR NO MIND LEFT TO LOSE</p><p>(Osho is talking to Amano Francesco.)</p><p>Amano means no-mind. That's the most fundamental thing in sannyas,
the capacity to put the mind aside and to look directly into life with
nothing interfering -- no prejudice, no thought, no philosophy, no
religion</p><p>-- to look into life without any a priori conclusion, just like a
mirror simply reflecting that which is. That is the state of Amano. Zen
people call it no-mind, and no-mind is the door to the divine.</p><p>It is the same door, only the direction changes. If you go outwards
it is mind, if you go inwards it is no-mind. If you want to know the
world then you have to use the mind, if your enquiry is scientific or
philosophic, then the mind is a must. But if your enquiry is mystical,
spiritual, religious, if you want to know yourself, if you are trying to
explore your own interiority, then no-mind is a must.</p><p>And Francesco means a free man. The man who is clouded by the mind is
the unfree man; then he is a Christian or a Hindu or a Mohammedan --
because mind</p><p>means either you belong to this religion or to that.</p><p>Then one is communist, fascist, socialist, then one can be theist,
atheist, and there are a thousand and one ideologies -- religious,
philosophical, social, economical -and all these are chains, very subtle
chains. You will find everybody a prisoner of something or other.</p><p>Even the idea of nations makes people prisoners. The Indian is
imprisoned in his past, the Italian is imprisoned in his tradition, the
Chinese is imprisoned in his -- the whole five thousand years of
thinking and philosophising. Nations are prisons, races are prisons, the
idea of the white man and the black man -- that too is a prison. And
they are very stupid kinds of prisons, because between the white man and
the black man there is only a little difference of colour pigment; not
more than four annas worth, one-fourth of a rupee --</p><p>and that too is in favour of the black man because he has more
pigment than the white man. He needs a certain pigment in his skin to
protect him from the sun. Just four annas worth of pigment is creating
so much nonsense in the world.</p><p>All these things have to be put aside, then you are in a state of
no-mind and then you are also free. And to have the taste of freedom is
the most beautiful thing in life. It is another name for god. In fact,
one of the 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>greatest enlightened masters of the East, Mahavira, never used the
word 'god'.</p><p>He always used the word</p><p>'freedom' for god. And I can understand why he insisted on using the
word 'freedom', 'moksha', because even the idea of god becomes an
imprisonment, because it divides people into the people who believe in
god and the people who don't believe in god. But you cannot find a
person who does not long for freedom.</p><p>Freedom is our most intrinsic longing, the deepest longing of the
heart. It can be achieved only by the process of no-mind. You can call
it meditation, awareness,</p><p>silence -- these are different names for the same phenomenon. LOVE IS
EGOCIDE</p><p>(Osho tells Premdaya that a sympathy that doesn't stem from love is
simply ego- fodder.) If you are in a certain kind of suffering you will
find many people sympathizing with you and if you look into their eyes
you will be puzzled; they are saying one thing -- they are very
sympathetic towards you</p><p>-- but their eyes are showing something else; they are enjoying it.
And there is a subtle mechanism in it.</p><p>When you sympathize with somebody you are higher and the person you
are sympathizing with is lower, and everybody enjoys feeling higher in
some way.</p><p>For example, if your house is burned down the whole neighborhood will
come to sympathize with you.</p><p>But if you make a beautiful house nobody will come to appreciate it;
they will all feel jealous. Strange! If they really feel sympathy when
your house gets burned down they should feel very happy, they should
celebrate, when you make a new home. But they don't celebrate, and that
makes things clear; they are not really happy in your happiness, they
are happy in your misery.</p><p>So sympathy to me is ugly if it is not rooted in love. It is
beautiful if it is rooted in love. So love to me is a revolutionary
phenomenon; it changes sympathy into something totally different to what
it is. Sympathy should not be because people are in sorrow, sympathy
should be because you are too full of love and you want to share it.
Then there will be a great difference, you will rejoice when they are
happy and you will feel sad when they are unhappy. You will not feel
happy when they are sad and you will not feel jealous when they are
happy; their happiness will be your happiness and their sadness will be
your sadness.</p><p>Once Gautam the Buddha was asked, "What is more difficult? -- to feel
sad when somebody is sad or to feel happy when somebody is happy." And
Buddha said the second thing is more difficult; the first thing is not
difficult. One can feel sad when others are sad because deep down one
can enjoy it, but when others are happy, to celebrate, to really
celebrate, is very difficult -- it goes against our ego. Hence my
emphasis is on love because love basically requires that you drop the
ego. Love kills the ego, and when there is no ego then love can blossom
in many</p><p>flowers; sympathy is one of those flowers. But it is no more plastic
then, it has its source in love.</p><p>The Christian missionaries going around the world and serving poor
people are all living out of sympathy; their service is not out of love,
not at all. It is cunning, it is very calculated. They are serving the
poor people because they want to enjoy the pleasures of heaven. They are
not concerned about the poor people, their whole concern is to use them
as a ladder to reach heaven. And not only that, they are serving the
poor people to convert them into their religion. It is a political
game.</p><p>Even a woman like Mother Teresa of Calcutta who has been serving
orphans for her whole life and helps the orphan children to be adopted
by families... but the subtle trick is that those children are given
only to Catholic families, not to anybody else -- not even to a
Protestant family, although they are also Christians.</p><p>Just a few days ago a Protestant couple reached Calcutta and because
they don't have any children, they wanted to adopt a child. They were
refused because they were not Catholic. So it is not a question of
serving the orphans, it is really a strategy to exploit poor people,
their children, to convert them into Christianity. It is buying people,
purchasing people, it is using people as commodities.</p><p>And these people who serve humanity are respected very much, all
kinds of honors are given to them.</p><p>Nobel prizes are given to them, and all the countries go on
respecting them - and nobody looks at the subtle strategy that is behind
all this service. It is cunning, it is ugly, it is nauseating.</p><p>I don't teach my sannyasins to be servants of the people. Enough of
that! These servants of people have been the most mischievous people in
the world. Behind a beautiful name they have done immense harm. No more
of this any longer.</p><p>I teach simply love. Out of love if you feel to help, good, but that
help will be out of your love, your joy.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>There is no reward, there is no question of attaining some pleasures
in heaven, there is no question of converting somebody into a Hindu or a
Christian or a Mohammedan.</p><p>Hindus are angry at me for the simple reason that they wanted me to
convert all my sannyasins to Hinduism. Their anger is understandable. If
I had converted all my sannyasins into Hindus then of course they would
have respected me, they would have called me the greatest saint that has
ever been here on the earth. Now I am the greatest sinner to them.</p><p>Jainas wanted me to spread Jainism over the whole world and they were
ready to support me with as much money as I needed. I simply rejected
the idea; I said, "This is sheer nonsense you are talking to me. I
cannot spread anybody's message. Why should I spread anybody's message?
If your message has something in it people will come. I am not going to
be anybody's missionary. I am just going to be my love and whosoever
wants to partake of it is welcome. I never ask whether he is Christian
or Hindu or Mohammedan.</p><p>That is not the question at all, that is not my business at all."</p><p>One should live out of one's love and for no other reason, then life
becomes a beautiful phenomenon, music, a festivity.</p><p>LOVE: THE OVERFLOW FROM THE LAKE ALONENESS ACCUMULATES</p><p>(A balance is needed between being with others and loving, and being
alone and blissful, Osho tells us.) Both enhance each other, both enrich
each other. Your love makes you ready to go into aloneness, because one
can be with people only for a certain time then the desire to be alone
arises. It is a necessary phenomenon, a natural phenomenon.</p><p>And when one is alone one can be alone only for a certain period
because when one is alone one accumulates energy. It is not used, one
becomes a reservoir and then one needs people to share it. That is what
love is sharing the energy that becomes accumulated in your aloneness.
But when you share your energy, when</p><p>you live with people, slowly you feel exhausted, tired, depleted;
again the need has come to move into aloneness.</p><p>It is just like waking in the day and going to sleep in the night,
for the whole day you are working, you feel tired and it is beautiful to
feel tired. It has been a beautiful day of creativity; you worked in the
sun, in the rain, in the wind, now you are ready to fall into deep
sleep, to regain energy, to become ready again for work tomorrow.</p><p>So bliss is like sleep and love is like creativity. And my sannyasins
have to fulfil both together; then the person is whole. A person who
cannot sleep will go insane, and the person who cannot wake up will be
in a coma, will be dead.</p><p>So both are needed: a deep capacity to go into sleep, into a
dreamless sleep, and then immense energy to be creative. And they are
not against each other, remember, they are complementary.</p><p>AN ABSOLUTELY DEVICEFUL TIME</p><p>(Osho speaks on Blissneyland.)</p><p>A man without bliss is homeless, he is not at ease with existence, he
is always tense, never relaxed. He is always full of anxiety and
anguish. He does not know how to be in a let-go. Existence seems to be
inimical to him; he cannot think of it as his home, he feels as n
outsider. It is hiS own creation, this whole idea of being an outsider.
Particularly in this century the idea that man is an outsider, is a
stranger, that he does not belong to the world, that man is alienated,
has become very dominant. All those ideas are simply wrong, but they
look very solid, convincing, for the simple reason that man has
forgotten how to be blissful.</p><p>Once you feel blissful you are no more an outsider, you are an
insider. You are no more a stranger, you belong to this existence and
this existence belongs to you. You are needed by existence and existence
is needed by you. It is a mutual need.</p><p>We are partners in the same organic unity and everybody is essential;
from the smallest blade of grass to the biggest star, everybody is
needed, equally needed. There is no hierarchy in existence. The grass
blade and the star have no inequality; they are equal. Existence
supports them both in the same way, it makes no discrimination. To the
sinners, to the saints, it is the same. The sun</p><p>shines for all, the flowers bloom for all, the birds sing for all. It
is our home! But without a taste of blissfulness it cannot be felt.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-4>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>So my whole approach here is to help you to be cheerful, blissful,
singing, dancing, creating all devices so that you can relax, come out
of your conditioned sadness, seriousness, so that you can be children
again, running on the sea beach collecting seashells, coloured stones,
running after butterflies, collecting wild flowers with great wonder and
awe.</p><p>My sannyasins are not seriously religious people -- sincerely
religious but not seriously religious. They are playful, and playfulness
is one of the most important things to understand. Life should be taken
as fun, as a beautiful joke.</p><p>The movement you are capable of taking life as fun, as a beautiful
joke, your vision changes. Suddenly you are at home, suddenly all is
good, suddenly trees start saying 'hello' to you! Rocks start asking
'How are you?' (laughter) The whole existence becomes alive in a new
sense, in a way it has never been before.</p><p>Unless that happens a man is not enlightened, is not awakened to the
ultimate truth. That is our goal.</p><p>A CLOUD'S EYE VIEW</p><p>(No particular place to go and no special way to be -- that's what a
sannyasin has in common with a cloud.)</p><p>The metaphor of the cloud has to be understood. It will give you a
few hints about blissfulness. The first thing about a cloud is that it
has no direction, it is not destined towards any goal; it is simply
floating. It is available to the winds wherever they take it, it is
utterly relaxed. When you have a destination you are tense, you are
worried about whether you are going to make it or not. And if the winds
start blowing in the opposite direction then certainly there will be
great</p><p>anxiety. Rather than going towards the goal you are going against
it.</p><p>The cloud has no goal so wherever the winds take it it is perfectly
at ease. Wherever it finds itself that is its home. The same is true
about bliss. A blissful person lives now and here, he has no desire to
be somewhere else. Now is more than enough, he is utterly contented with
it.</p><p>Secondly, the cloud has no fixed form. It is constantly changing. One
moment it looks like an elephant, the next moment it has become a camel,
and it goes on changing. The same is true about bliss. It has no
particular form; it is not a solid thing, it is flexible, so it can be
found in all forms.</p><p>Yes, the man of understanding can find it in the body, in the mind,
in the heart: in being. He can find it in himself, he can find it in
others; he can find it in music, in poetry, in painting; he can find it
in aloneness; he can find it in the mountains, he can find it in the
marketplace.</p><p>It is not a fixed thing; rather it is an understanding, a
sensibility, a sensitiveness, so one can feel it wherever it is. And it
is good that it is not a fixed thing otherwise we would have become
bored by now.</p><p>Because it is found in thousands of forms and thousands of ways, it
is always an adventure. It is always intriguing, interesting, it is
always inviting.</p><p>So remember those two things: live life herenow and search for bliss
in every possible form and you will find it because it is there.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=going-all-the-way>Going All the Way</h3><p>Chapter #7</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part5>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

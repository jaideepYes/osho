It is for reference purposes only.]\nSOUL OR SLAVE\n(Osho talks on the rebellion that must necessarily ensue if one's determined to be an individual in our society.)\nSociety kills the rebellious spirit in every child; it is afraid of rebellion. But the moment the rebellious spirit is destroyed simultaneously intelligence, brightness, genius, are also destroyed. They are all together, they can exist only in a togetherness. They form an organic unity. You cannot destroy one part; either you destroy the whole or you save the whole.\nAnd society is not interested in the individual; its interest is in the structure, in the establishment, in the state, in the church and in all kinds of investments. The individual is not even counted. The individual is accepted only because he has a certain utility for the establishment, because the individual can be used as a means to fulfil certain ends which are not his, they are others -- the politicians, the priests or whosoever they may be.\nEvery child is born a genius but very few people have been able to escape from the slavery that society imposes. The beginning is in rebellion. Rebel against the\ntradition, rebel against the church, rebel against the mob psychology. And the fundamental law is to insist on being yourself whatsoever the cost, and then you will have great intelligence flowering, brightness, and your life will become alight unto itself.\nThat's what sannyas is all about the rebellion of the individual against the collective, against the crowd, I believe in the individual because only the individual has a soul. Society is only a name without a soul, and the individual cannot be sacrificed for any end -- nation, race, religion. Nothing is more valuable than the individual. To me the individual is the ultimate value, Respect yourself and in that very respect you will be able to respect others too.\nDIVINITY IS BEING FREE\nAny experience of the unlimited is the experience of the divine. The search for the divine is really the search for expansion, the search for a consciousness which is absolutely free, a consciousness which is as wide as the sky itself.\nGod is not a person somewhere; it is your own feeling of expanding consciousness. It is an experience.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nAnd it is not difficult to know, because all the boundaries are arbitrary. They can be destroyed because we have made them, they are man-made; they don't exist in existence itself. If they existed in existence, then there would be no way to get rid of them. It is good that they are just in our minds. For example, countries; they exist only on maps not on the earth, and the maps can be burned and we can be finished with it. The earth remains undivided even though we go on dividing it on the maps.\nIt is one planet; it is not Asia, and Africa and Europe, it is not this country or that\n-- it is one earth. The idea of belonging to a nation is just an idea, hence it can be dropped without any effort. The moment you see that it is only an idea --\narbitrary, man-made, invented -- in that very understanding it is dropped. And so are our other boundaries too; the boundary of being black and white, the boundary of being a Catholic or a Protestant, the boundary of being a Christian or a Hindu are all our inventions. The child comes just as a pure human being, with no name, with no adjective.\nA sannyasin has to become a child again, with no name, with no adjective. Then suddenly you start feeling that the boundaries have disappeared and your consciousness is no more confined.\nWe carry the past and the past becomes a great burden. Then we invent the future; the future becomes a burden. The past is heavy on us, but it is only in our memory, it is nowhere else; and the future is only in our desires, nowhere else. We can erase the psychological memories and the psychological desires. It is a simple phenomenon like cleaning a slate; it is in the writing.\nOnce a man has done that, for the first time he becomes aware of how wide, how vast, life is and how beautiful.\nThen you are a bird on the wing in the infinite sky. That freedom is our deepest longing.\nSannyas is an effort towards that freedom. CHRIST-INANITY\n(The formal religion that grew out of Christ's teachings, an the spirit of Christ's life seem irreconcilable to the point of being ridiculous.)\nOne of the most important teachings of Jesus is to rejoice. It can be said to be his fundamental gift to humanity: Rejoice -- he says again and again, rejoice... although the so-called Christianity, the organised religion which exists in his name has gone just the opposite to his teaching. If you look at the faces of Christian saints you cannot believe that they are rejoicing. In fact Christians have also painted Jesus as being very sad, serious, sombre, as if he carried the cross for his whole life.\nJust the opposite is the case: if I were to paint Jesus he would be laughing on the cross, he would be laughing at the whole stupidity of people, the whole\nridiculousness of it he had been trying to give you a new life and you are rewarding him with death? Isn't it far out? (laughter) He must have enjoyed the scene: this was something! He must have laughed at the cosmic joke.\nJesus can only laugh even on the cross. Yet Christians say that he never laughed\n-- not only on the cross but never laughed at all in his whole life. That's a myth invented by sad people, sadists, masochists. They are sad and they are projecting their sadness on Jesus.\nSo the Christianity that exists is just the opposite of Christ. But this is so of other religions; the same is the situation with the Buddhists and with the Hindus. Now, Hindus think they follow Krishna but they don't at all. They cannot even tolerate my sannyasins holding hands or hugging and they think they are followers of Krishna. It is strange that they can't see the absurdity: Krishna had sixteen thousand girlfriends, and his whole life was of dance and song -- and these followers of Krishna, who are calling themselves Hindus, cannot accept my sannyasins. They think my sannyasins are destroying their culture because they don't look like saints; they should be serious, fasting, torturing themselves. But Krishna never tortured himself; he lived like a king, as everybody should. He loved life, as everybody should.\nThe Hindus are as against Krishna and the Buddhists are against Buddha. Now continuously observing this I have come to the conclusion that every organised religion is against the original founder of that religion; it has been so without any exception. There seems to be a certain law working in it. It seems that the moment the original founder dies, the very people against whom he has been fighting his whole life start capturing whatsoever movement he has created and they start manipulating his philosophy of life according to their own ideas. That is their revenge. They could not do it while he is alive but now that he has gone they can.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nYou can be a Christian only if you are not a Catholic, not a Protestant, if you\ndon't belong to any Christian organised sect, only then can you be a Christian. You can be a Christian if you rejoice. It is not a question of believing in doctrines, it is a question of living a totally different kind of lifes the life of bliss.\nSo rejoice -- and that is the only way you will find Christ-consciousness.\n(Osho speaks further on Christ-consciousness to another sannyas.) Christ is not the name of any person, Jesus has no monopoly over it He was only one of the Christs; there have been many before and many afterwards and there will be many in the future. He is part of a long chain of Christs.\nTo me Christ only represents a certain state of consciousness, the ultimate peak of consciousness. In the East we call it Buddha-consciousness -- it is the same: you can say everybody carries a Buddha within him.\nBut one can know the Christ or the Buddha within oneself only through meditation. It is not a question of believing, you have to discover it.\nMeditation is not belief, it is enquiry, it is a deep search within your being. And if one dive4 deep within oneself one is bound to find, because it is one's innermost core. Then what word you use for it is irrelevant\n-- you can call it the Christ or the Krishna or the Buddha or you may not call anything. You may simply call it the ultimate silence or the ultimate awareness, the ultimate freedom.\nBut the only way to find is meditation and meditation means turning in. We are extroverts, moving farther and farther from our own being.\nMeditation is an inner journey, not going out but going in. There is no need to create a conflict between the two. When you are needed on the outside be on the outside and when you have time then there is no need to be on the outside -- go in. Make it harmonious.\nJust as in the day you are awake and in the night you fall asleep, in the same way one should be able to go out and to go in. I don't want my sannyasins to be obsessed by anything; they should be flexible, not fixed, not like things. They should be more fluid and they will be able to relate with others and they should be capable of being alone too.\nWhen both are possible the person who chooses one is foolish because he is missing half of his life.\nSo live on the outside, live on the inside, but remember that only on the inside will you find the Christ.\nOn the outside you can find comforts and conveniences, that's all. On the inside you can find the ultimate bliss. On the inside you can find the truth, the truth which liberates, which liberates one from all misery.\nCONTACT HIGH\n(Osho explains the meaning of her new name to Premdip, and then talks about the magic that happens in the meeting of a master and a disciple.)\nPremdip means the light of love, a small lamp of love -- but that's enough: just a small flame of love in your heart is more than enough because it transforms your whole life.\nHowsoever small it is, it is explosive, it makes you aflame. Soon it starts spreading and not only are you totally consumed by it, it even starts kindling other people's hearts. That's how true religion spreads. You come in contact with a master and suddenly your heart is pulsating with a new beat. Something has jumped from the master into your heart, something which is invisible, mysterious, something which is not possible to give to anybody intentionally. It is a very strange phenomenon: the master does not give it, the disciple does not ask for it but it happens.\nThe Zen people have the right statement about it. They say that when a line of birds flies over a lake the lake has no intention of reflecting them, they have no intention of being reflected in the lake, but still the reflection happens. It is unintended from both sides.\nThe case is similar when one meets a master, when one comes across a Buddha. The Buddha knows he cannot give it -- it is not a thing to be given -- and the person who comes in contact suddenly becomes aware how can it be given. How can I ask for it? -- it is not something to be asked for or desired. But in encountering a Buddha, in the very meeting, it happens.\nLove is an inner flame in the heart. All that one can do is remove the barriers,\nremove all that is unloving in you, drop all that is unloving in you. It is just like opening your doors and your windows. You cannot force the sun to come in but you can open the window and the sun comes of its own accord -- you remove the barriers.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThe whole process of mystical transformation is negative: you remove the hindrances, the obstacles and the walls. And when there is no obstruction, suddenly it is there. Out of nowhere, from the beyond, it descends.\nThe moment your heart starts feeling the light you become aware of who you are, and then life is a beautiful experience of sharing love; you can go on sharing it. Then it is not a question of with whom you are, you simply share it. You share it with rocks, you share it with people, you share it with the mountains, you share it with the rivers, the oceans. You simply share it because the more you share, the more you have it.\n(To Melissa, a middle-aged American woman, a psychologist, Osho gives the name Premgit, and continues on the theme of love.)\nLife should be a song of love -- that's the only true religion. All else is rubbish, rubbish created by the priests, the theologians. The truth is very simple, not complicated, but the theologian complicates it; his business is to complicate it. He spins and weaves theories and people can be lost in his theories as if they are lost in a jungle. They go in search for solutions and they find more and more problems. Each solution given by the theologian brings ten more now problems. It is a very insane effort -- theology is insanity.\nReligion is very simple. It can be reduced to one word -- love. And if one is capable of loving, one is bound to find god. In fact one need not go in search of god, god comes in search of the person who loves.\nHe earns it, he deserves it, god comes as a reward.\nSo let your life be a song of love, a celebration of love, and then one day you are in for a great surprise: suddenly god knocks on your door. He does not come as a person; he is not a person but a presence.\nSuddenly one day you become aware of a totally new kind of presence surrounding you both within and without, a new light, a new energy, a new delight of which you had never even dreamt.\nAnd the moment you come in contact with that new phenomenon you know it is going to remain forever. You simply know it, no proofs are needed; it is self- evident.\n-- How long will you be here?\n-- Seven months this time.\n-- That's good. Next time, forever! (laughter) Good! (She has risen to stand and her back is towards Osho as he adds enigmatically:)\nI have recognised you! (She has turned to face Osho. As he concludes with a chuckle she looks back at him, a question mark on her face, and grins wryly as she makes her exit.) MORE THAN JUST GOOD FRIENDS\n(Friendliness is an offspring of true religiousness, Osho tells Dharma Mitro -- and it's an even higher state than friendship.)\nFriendship exists between two persons; it is relationship. Friendliness is only a quality; it need not depend on any relationship. It is just the way you live your lire -- it is a friendly life. You are friendly to everything, to the whole existence. You are just a friend, not addressed to anybody in particular, but addressed to the whole, to all.\nIn friendship you make an exclusive relationship and you may remain inimical to many people. So enmity and friendship can exist together -- in fact you will have very few friends and many more enemies.\nBut friendliness cannot have any enmity in it, it is inclusive, inclusive of all. And to know friendliness is to know the real juice of life. Life reveals its mysteries only to those who have come to the state of friendliness.\nReligion, as it exists, creates enmity. The Christian is against the Hindu, the Hindu is against the Buddhist, the Buddhist is against the Mohammedan -- they create enmity. These religions are just political ideologies masquerading as religions, politics hiding behind the facade of religion. This is more dangerous than ordinary politics because at least the ordinary politics is honest, it does not hide itself, but these so-called religions are just politics pretending to be religious. These are more dangerous; this is more cunning, more deceptive, more poisoning.\nA true religious person cannot have any enmity in him. That is the criterion of a true religious person.\nAnd it starts happening -- the more you move into meditation, the more you become silent, the more you become aware, it starts happening naturally: the friend in you is born. And the day the friend is born you 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nhave fulfilled sannyas.\nSannyas is a birth process. Its culmination is in that ultimate peak called friendliness.\n(He'd like to replace the words god and prayer -- and even love -- with friendliness, Osho declares to the last person for sannyas tonight.)\nMeditation needs not followers but friends. The follower is stupid; he follows out of his stupidity: because he cannot depend on himself he starts depending on somebody else, but he is a slave, a psychological slave, and psychological slavery is a deeper slavery than all other slaveries. It is very subtle, you cannot see it, but you can feel it. The people who call god the father are just looking for a father figure; they want to depend on a father. Or there are religions which call god the mother -- it is the same, there is no difference at all.\nThese people are childish, they are not grown-ups. They may be old is age but psychologically they are retarded. All followers are retarded people. My\nsannyasins are not my followers but my friends.\nFollowing comes through belief; friendship, friendliness is born out of meditation. So I don't give you any doctrine, I don't give you any philosophy. To me all those philosophical dogmas and great systems of thought are simply bullshit. But people are so interested in rotten things that they go on carrying all that load their whole life. They are just big words, jargon, esoteric jargon.\nI am not interested at all in any kind of jargon. You have to be very simple with me because it is a question of enquiry. You need an innocent, silent, enquiring mind, not full of belief, not full of philosophy, just clean.\nSannyasins are fellow travellers. We don't have a church, we don't have a doctrine, a dogma, we don't have any beliefs; we share only one thing with each other, and that is meditation. All those who have gathered close to me are here just to learn meditation -- and meditation means silence, not chanting, not repeating a mantra. That is not meditation, that is just a simple process of auto- hypnosis.\nMeditation means becoming aware and silent, watching your mind with all its game, trips, numbers.\nAnd the miracle is that if you can watch silently all those trips and numbers and games disappear. Just by simple watching they evaporate. One day you are there and the mind is no more. That sudden silence, that profound silence when the mind is not at all.… You look for it because you have become habituated with it, it is an old habit; you search for where it has gone and you cannot find it anywhere -- even if you go to the four corners of the world you will not find it... That state is silence, meditation, samadhi.\nAnd out of that state is a new upsurge of energy. Call it love, call it friendliness, call it prayer -- because all these are aspects of it. But to call it friendliness is the best, because if you call it prayer it stinks of old religion; if you call it god many people withdraw, they become afraid -- god has tortured them enough. In the name of god so much stupidity has happened on the earth that it is time to quit.\nBut if you call it friendliness nobody is offended. It has never been called friendliness, hence I call it friendliness. The word is fresh and young, without any old associations.\nMy sannyasins are friends -- friends to me, friends to each other, friends to the whole existence.\nGoing All the Way Chapter #26\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3575","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/going_all_the_way/part25/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/going_all_the_way/>Going All The Way</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>17 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3575 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Going_All_The_Way/part25.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part24>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

priests or whosoever they may be.</p><p>Every child is born a genius but very few people have been able to
escape from the slavery that society imposes. The beginning is in
rebellion. Rebel against the</p><p>tradition, rebel against the church, rebel against the mob
psychology. And the fundamental law is to insist on being yourself
whatsoever the cost, and then you will have great intelligence
flowering, brightness, and your life will become alight unto itself.</p><p>That's what sannyas is all about the rebellion of the individual
against the collective, against the crowd, I believe in the individual
because only the individual has a soul. Society is only a name without a
soul, and the individual cannot be sacrificed for any end -- nation,
race, religion. Nothing is more valuable than the individual. To me the
individual is the ultimate value, Respect yourself and in that very
respect you will be able to respect others too.</p><p>DIVINITY IS BEING FREE</p><p>Any experience of the unlimited is the experience of the divine. The
search for the divine is really the search for expansion, the search for
a consciousness which is absolutely free, a consciousness which is as
wide as the sky itself.</p><p>God is not a person somewhere; it is your own feeling of expanding
consciousness. It is an experience.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished>Osho's books on

arbitrary. They can be destroyed because <em>we</em> have made them,
they are man-made; they don't exist in existence itself. If they existed
in existence, then there would be no way to get rid of them. It is good
that they are just in our minds. For example, countries; they exist only
on maps not on the earth, and the maps can be burned and we can be
finished with it. The earth remains undivided even though we go on
dividing it on the maps.</p><p>It is <em>one</em> planet; it is not Asia, and Africa and Europe, it
is not this country or that</p><p>-- it is <em>one</em> earth. The idea of belonging to a nation is
just an idea, hence it can be dropped without any effort. The moment you
see that it is only an idea --</p><p>arbitrary, man-made, invented -- in that very understanding it is
dropped. And so are our other boundaries too; the boundary of being
black and white, the boundary of being a Catholic or a Protestant, the
boundary of being a Christian or a Hindu are all our inventions. The
child comes just as a pure human being, with no name, with no
adjective.</p><p>A sannyasin has to become a child again, with no name, with no
adjective. Then suddenly you start feeling that the boundaries have
disappeared and your consciousness is no more confined.</p><p>We carry the past and the past becomes a great burden. Then we invent
the future; the future becomes a burden. The past is heavy on us, but it
is only in our memory, it is nowhere else; and the future is only in our
desires, nowhere else. We can erase the psychological memories and the
psychological desires. It is a simple phenomenon like cleaning a slate;
it is in the writing.</p><p>Once a man has done that, for the first time he becomes aware of how
wide, how vast, life is and how beautiful.</p><p>Then you are a bird on the wing in the infinite sky. That freedom is
our deepest longing.</p><p>Sannyas is an effort towards that freedom. CHRIST-INANITY</p><p>(The formal religion that grew out of Christ's teachings, an the
spirit of Christ's life seem irreconcilable to the point of being
ridiculous.)</p><p>One of the most important teachings of Jesus is to rejoice. It can be
said to be his fundamental gift to humanity: Rejoice -- he says again
and again, rejoice... although the so-called Christianity, the organised
religion which exists in his name has gone just the opposite to his
teaching. If you look at the faces of Christian saints you cannot
believe that they are rejoicing. In fact Christians have also painted
Jesus as being very sad, serious, sombre, as if he carried the cross for
his whole life.</p><p>Just the opposite is the case: if I were to paint Jesus he would be
laughing on the cross, he would be laughing at the whole stupidity of
people, the whole</p><p>ridiculousness of it he had been trying to give you a new life and
you are rewarding him with death? Isn't it far out? (laughter) He must
have enjoyed the scene: this was something! He must have laughed at the
cosmic joke.</p><p>Jesus can only laugh even on the cross. Yet Christians say that he
never laughed</p><p>-- not only on the cross but never laughed at all in his whole life.
That's a myth invented by sad people, sadists, masochists. They are sad
and they are projecting their sadness on Jesus.</p><p>So the Christianity that exists is just the opposite of Christ. But
this is so of other religions; the same is the situation with the
Buddhists and with the Hindus. Now, Hindus think they follow Krishna but
they don't at all. They cannot even tolerate my sannyasins holding hands
or hugging and they think they are followers of Krishna. It is strange
that they can't see the absurdity: Krishna had sixteen thousand
girlfriends, and his whole life was of dance and song -- and these
followers of Krishna, who are calling themselves Hindus, cannot accept
my sannyasins. They think my sannyasins are destroying their culture
because they don't look like saints; they should be serious, fasting,
torturing themselves. But Krishna never tortured himself; he lived like
a king, as everybody should. He loved life, as everybody should.</p><p>The Hindus are as against Krishna and the Buddhists are against
Buddha. Now continuously observing this I have come to the conclusion
that every organised religion is against the original founder of that
religion; it has been so without any exception. There seems to be a
certain law working in it. It seems that the moment the original founder
dies, the very people against whom he has been fighting his whole life
start capturing whatsoever movement he has created and they start
manipulating his philosophy of life according to their own ideas. That
is their revenge. They could not do it while he is alive but now that he
has gone they can.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on

Protestant, if you</p><p>don't belong to any Christian organised sect, only then can you be a
Christian. You can be a Christian if you rejoice. It is not a question
of believing in doctrines, it is a question of living a totally
different kind of lifes the life of bliss.</p><p>So rejoice -- and that is the only way you will find
Christ-consciousness.</p><p>(Osho speaks further on Christ-consciousness to another sannyas.)
Christ is not the name of any person, Jesus has no monopoly over it He
was only one of the Christs; there have been many before and many
afterwards and there will be many in the future. He is part of a long
chain of Christs.</p><p>To me Christ only represents a certain state of consciousness, the
ultimate peak of consciousness. In the East we call it
Buddha-consciousness -- it is the same: you can say everybody carries a
Buddha within him.</p><p>But one can know the Christ or the Buddha within oneself only through
meditation. It is not a question of believing, you have to discover
it.</p><p>Meditation is not belief, it is enquiry, it is a deep search within
your being. And if one dive4 deep within oneself one is bound to find,
because it is one's innermost core. Then what word you use for it is
irrelevant</p><p>-- you can call it the Christ or the Krishna or the Buddha or you may
not call anything. You may simply call it the ultimate silence or the
ultimate awareness, the ultimate freedom.</p><p>But the only way to <em>find</em> is meditation and meditation means
turning in. We are extroverts, moving farther and farther from our own
being.</p><p>Meditation is an inner journey, not going out but going in. There is
no need to create a conflict between the two. When you are needed on the
outside be on the outside and when you have time then there is no need
to be on the outside -- go in. Make it harmonious.</p><p>Just as in the day you are awake and in the night you fall asleep, in
the same way one should be able to go out and to go in. I don't want my
sannyasins to be obsessed by anything; they should be flexible, not
fixed, not like things. They should be more fluid and they will be able
to relate with others and they should be capable of being alone too.</p><p>When both are possible the person who chooses one is foolish because
he is missing half of his life.</p><p>So live on the outside, live on the inside, but remember that only on
the inside will you find the Christ.</p><p>On the outside you can find comforts and conveniences, that's all. On
the inside you can find the ultimate bliss. On the inside you can find
the truth, the truth which liberates, which liberates one from all
misery.</p><p>CONTACT HIGH</p><p>(Osho explains the meaning of her new name to Premdip, and then talks
about the magic that happens in the meeting of a master and a
disciple.)</p><p>Premdip means the light of love, a small lamp of love -- but that's
enough: just a small flame of love in your heart is more than enough
because it transforms your whole life.</p><p>Howsoever small it is, it is explosive, it makes you aflame. Soon it
starts spreading and not only are you totally consumed by it, it even
starts kindling other people's hearts. That's how true religion spreads.
You come in contact with a master and suddenly your heart is pulsating
with a new beat. Something has jumped from the master into your heart,
something which is invisible, mysterious, something which is not
possible to give to anybody intentionally. It is a very strange
phenomenon: the master does not give it, the disciple does not ask for
it but it happens.</p><p>The Zen people have the right statement about it. They say that when
a line of birds flies over a lake the lake has no intention of
reflecting them, they have no intention of being reflected in the lake,
but still the reflection happens. It is unintended from both sides.</p><p>The case is similar when one meets a master, when one comes across a
Buddha. The Buddha knows he cannot give it -- it is not a thing to be
given -- and the person who comes in contact suddenly becomes aware how
can it be given. How can I ask for it? -- it is not something to be
asked for or desired. But in encountering a Buddha, in the very meeting,
it happens.</p><p>Love is an inner flame in the heart. All that one can do is remove
the barriers,</p><p>remove all that is unloving in you, drop all that is unloving in you.
It is just like opening your doors and your windows. You cannot force
the sun to come in but you can open the window and the sun comes of its
own accord -- you remove the barriers.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

the hindrances, the obstacles and the walls. And when there is no
obstruction, suddenly it is there. Out of nowhere, from the beyond, it
descends.</p><p>The moment your heart starts feeling the light you become aware of
who you are, and then life is a beautiful experience of sharing love;
you can go on sharing it. Then it is not a question of with whom you
are, you simply share it. You share it with rocks, you share it with
people, you share it with the mountains, you share it with the rivers,
the oceans. You simply share it because the more you share, the more you
have it.</p><p>(To Melissa, a middle-aged American woman, a psychologist, Osho gives
the name Premgit, and continues on the theme of love.)</p><p>Life should be a song of love -- that's the only true religion. All
else is rubbish, rubbish created by the priests, the theologians. The
truth is very simple, not complicated, but the theologian complicates
it; his business is to complicate it. He spins and weaves theories and
people can be lost in his theories as if they are lost in a jungle. They
go in search for solutions and they find more and more problems. Each
solution given by the theologian brings ten more now problems. It is a
very insane effort -- theology is insanity.</p><p>Religion is very simple. It can be reduced to one word -- love. And
if one is capable of loving, one is bound to find god. In fact one need
not go in search of god, god comes in search of the person who
loves.</p><p>He earns it, he deserves it, god comes as a reward.</p><p>So let your life be a song of love, a celebration of love, and then
one day you are in for a great surprise: suddenly god knocks on your
door. He does not come as a person; he is not a person but a
presence.</p><p>Suddenly one day you become aware of a totally new kind of presence
surrounding you both within and without, a new light, a new energy, a
new delight of which you had never even dreamt.</p><p>And the moment you come in contact with that new phenomenon you know
it is going to remain forever. You simply know it, no proofs are needed;
it is self- evident.</p><p>-- How long will you be here?</p><p>-- Seven months this time.</p><p>-- That's good. Next time, forever! (laughter) Good! (She has risen
to stand and her back is towards Osho as he adds enigmatically:)</p><p>I have recognised you! (She has turned to face Osho. As he concludes
with a chuckle she looks back at him, a question mark on her face, and
grins wryly as she makes her exit.) MORE THAN JUST GOOD FRIENDS</p><p>(Friendliness is an offspring of true religiousness, Osho tells
Dharma Mitro -- and it's an even higher state than friendship.)</p><p>Friendship exists between two persons; it is relationship.
Friendliness is only a quality; it need not depend on any relationship.
It is just the way you live your lire -- it is a friendly life. You are
friendly to everything, to the whole existence. You are just a friend,
not addressed to anybody in particular, but addressed to the whole, to
all.</p><p>In friendship you make an exclusive relationship and you may remain
inimical to many people. So enmity and friendship can exist together --
in fact you will have very few friends and many more enemies.</p><p>But friendliness cannot have any enmity in it, it is inclusive,
inclusive of all. And to know friendliness is to know the real juice of
life. Life reveals its mysteries only to those who have come to the
state of friendliness.</p><p>Religion, as it exists, creates enmity. The Christian is against the
Hindu, the Hindu is against the Buddhist, the Buddhist is against the
Mohammedan -- they create enmity. These religions are just political
ideologies masquerading as religions, politics hiding behind the facade
of religion. This is more dangerous than ordinary politics because at
least the ordinary politics is honest, it does not hide itself, but
these so-called religions are just politics pretending to be religious.
These are more dangerous; this is more cunning, more deceptive, more
poisoning.</p><p>A true religious person cannot have any enmity in him. That is the
criterion of a true religious person.</p><p>And it starts happening -- the more you move into meditation, the
more you become silent, the more you become aware, it starts happening
naturally: the friend in you is born. And the day the friend is born you

called friendliness.</p><p>(He'd like to replace the words god and prayer -- and even love --
with friendliness, Osho declares to the last person for sannyas
tonight.)</p><p>Meditation needs not followers but friends. The follower is stupid;
he follows out of his stupidity: because he cannot depend on himself he
starts depending on somebody else, but he is a slave, a psychological
slave, and psychological slavery is a deeper slavery than all other
slaveries. It is very subtle, you cannot see it, but you can feel it.
The people who call god the father are just looking for a father figure;
they want to depend on a father. Or there are religions which call god
the mother -- it is the same, there is no difference at all.</p><p>These people are childish, they are not grown-ups. They may be old is
age but psychologically they are retarded. All followers are retarded
people. My</p><p>sannyasins are not my followers but my friends.</p><p>Following comes through belief; friendship, friendliness is born out
of meditation. So I don't give you any doctrine, I don't give you any
philosophy. To me all those philosophical dogmas and great systems of
thought are simply bullshit. But people are so interested in rotten
things that they go on carrying all that load their whole life. They are
just big words, jargon, esoteric jargon.</p><p>I am not interested at all in any kind of jargon. You have to be very
simple with me because it is a question of enquiry. You need an
innocent, silent, enquiring mind, not full of belief, not full of
philosophy, just clean.</p><p>Sannyasins are fellow travellers. We don't have a church, we don't
have a doctrine, a dogma, we don't have any beliefs; we share only one
thing with each other, and that is meditation. All those who have
gathered close to me are here just to learn meditation -- and meditation
means silence, not chanting, not repeating a mantra. That is not
meditation, that is just a simple process of auto- hypnosis.</p><p>Meditation means becoming aware and silent, watching your mind with
all its game, trips, numbers.</p><p>And the miracle is that if you can watch silently all those trips and
numbers and games disappear. Just by simple watching they evaporate. One
day you are there and the mind is no more. That sudden silence, that
profound silence when the mind is not at all.… You look for it because
you have become habituated with it, it is an old habit; you search for
where it has gone and you cannot find it anywhere -- even if you go to
the four corners of the world you will not find it... That state is
silence, meditation, samadhi.</p><p>And out of that state is a new upsurge of energy. Call it love, call
it friendliness, call it prayer -- because all these are aspects of it.
But to call it friendliness is the best, because if you call it prayer
it stinks of old religion; if you call it god many people withdraw, they
become afraid -- god has tortured them enough. In the name of god so
much stupidity has happened on the earth that it is time to quit.</p><p>But if you call it friendliness nobody is offended. It has never been
called friendliness, hence I call it friendliness. The word is fresh and
young, without any old associations.</p><p>My sannyasins are friends -- friends to me, friends to each other,
friends to the whole existence.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=going-all-the-way>Going All the Way</h3><p>Chapter #26</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part24>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

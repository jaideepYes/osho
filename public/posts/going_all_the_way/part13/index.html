It is for reference purposes only.]\nSANNYAS: PARADISE REGAINED\n(And paradise is freedom -- a value even higher than god.) The most divine act in life is to live in freedom. We are born free but we are not left free by society. The moment we are born society starts creating bondages around us -- gross, subtle and very subtle. So everybody is born in freedom but everybody lives as a prisoner and dies as a prisoner.\nSannyas means regaining your freedom, destroying all the barriers that have been created by the establishment, the state, the church. They have their vested interests. They want you to be slaves; they don't want anybody to live in freedom because a free person cannot be manipulated, cannot be dominated, cannot be possessed, cannot be reduced to a thing, to a commodity. And this society believes in commodities; it believes in machines not in man. The less of a man you are, the better, because machines cannot revolt, they cannot be disobedient.\nMan can revolt, he can go against the vested interests, hence up to now it has been always that each child is chained in such a complex way that only very few people have been able to live a life of freedom.\nOne has to be very alert, watchful, adventurous, courageous, to go into freedom.\nSannyas means all those things. It is a declaration of absolute freedom. Our search is not for god, our 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nsearch is for freedom. Of course when you are totally free you know god -- that's a by-product.\nMEDITATION: A WHETSTONE FOR YOUR WITS\nA man without meditation is bound to be mediocre, he cannot be bright, because meditation is the art of sharpening your intelligence; without meditation intelligence gathers rust. Then it is like a sword which has not been used. It is only a sword in name; it is absolutely useless.\nThe same is true about intelligence, it has to be continuously sharpened; and the only way to sharpen it is to accept the challenges of life meditatively. And by meditation I mean in deep silence, in calmness, quietness. Whenever a challenge is accepted in a calm and quiet way it sharpens your intelligence. It is not a disturbance, it is not a curse, it is a blessing.\nMeditation only teaches you the simple art of remaining centred in the turmoil of life. It teaches you to be a centre, always a centre in all kinds of cyclones. If you become disturbed you lose the opportunity, you become confused, unfamiliar, clouded; and that's how dust gathers. If you remain calm and quiet, as if nothing is happening to you -- you are only watching something on the TV screen -- then it gives sharpness, brightness. A moment comes when your inner brightness is so much that it becomes almost an explosion of light. Hence the word 'enlightenment'; that is the ultimate peak to which meditation can bring you.\nMeditation is climbing the mountain towards the sunlit peak. JUST GOOD FRIENDS\nThe man of meditation inevitably becomes a friend to existence, a friend to all. He loses enmity in him, so much so that even where there is a need he can at the most pretend, but deep inside he cannot feel enmity. He can act if there is a need\n-- and that's my understanding about many things which Christians are incapable of explaining about Jesus.\nHe taught about love, he taught about compassion, still he threw the moneychangers out of the temple violently. He said to his disciples if somebody hits you on one of your cheeks give him the other too. The same man took a whip in his hand and became so enraged with the moneychangers that single- handedly he threw them all out of the temple, turned their boards upside down and threw their money. He must have been really angry. Christians cannot explain how such a man like Jesus could have done it.\nMy own experience is he could pretend, he was pretending. He was not doing it, he was acting it -- it was needed. But he was not an enemy to anybody; he could not be.\nOne of the famous Sufi mystics, Rabiya el Adawiya, changed a few sentences in the Koran; wherever it said hate the enemy, the devil, Satan, she changed it, she removed it Another mystic, Hasan, was looking into Rabiya's copy of the Koran\n-- he could not believe his eyes, because this was sacrilegious. You cannot correct the Koran, no Mohammedan can think of it, because it is god's word -- who are you to correct it?\nHe asked Rabiya 'Who has destroyed your copy? Do you ever look into your copy or not? In many places I see a few words have been cut out.'\nRabiya said 'Nobody else has done it but myself. I had to do it because since I have known silence, since I have known god, I cannot hate. And this is my copy, it is nobody else's business. I have to change it according to my deepening consciousness. It may have been right when I knew nothing of meditation but now it is no more right. Even if the devil appears before me I can only love, I can only be friendly. I would welcome him the same way I have welcomed you, Hasan,' she said. 'I would ask him to rest, to relax, I would ask him to be my honourable guest; I would serve him. I cannot hate.'\nMeditation makes you a friend to the whole existence. And that is the most beautiful experience -- when there is no hatred left in you. Thousands of flowers\nbloom in your being, all thorns start opening lie flowers.\nThis is the transformation that sannyas is aiming at, this is the goal. LOONEY AS A LOVER\n(Sannyas is marriage to the unknown and the unknowable; it is falling in love with existence, Osho tells Deva Parinita.)\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nIt is not a logical phenomenon, but a love affair -- a mad mad love affair.\nThe ultimate secrets are open only to lovers, not to logicians. And if one wants to get the deepest into existence then a certain quality of madness is a must. In fact the person who is perfectly sane is insane; to be absolutely sane means to be just shallow, empty, meaningless, because the perfectly sane person will not have any poetry in his life, will not have any love in his life, will not have any celebration in his life. It is not possible for him. For that you need a little touch of madness. Just a little touch of madness and closed doors start opening!\nI teach the madness called love, the madness called meditation. These are all mad things, that's why only a very few chosen people have ever tried them; the majority never bothers about these things. They are calculators, business people, mathematicians. They cannot understand what you are doing. A businessman looking at Buddha meditating under his tree with closed eyes sitting for hours will think he is a fool. In fact in the Hindi language the word 'fool' comes from 'Buddha'. 'Buddha' means the awakened one and from the same root comes 'buddhu' -- Buddhu means the fool.\nThere were two types of people: a few thought Buddha was awakened and a few thought he was just a fool, hence from the same root both words have arisen. But the majority agreed that he was a fool. His father thought he was a fool, his wife thought he was a fool. In fact anybody would have thought him a fool\n-- escaping from a beautiful wife, child, kingdom, palace, all the luxuries and then just sitting under a tree like a beggar. What kind of sanity was that?\nOne of the most beautiful women India has given birth to was Meera. She was a queen and she left the palace and danced over streets and villages singing songs of god. She sang the most beautiful songs -- I have never come across anything more poetic. And she was not a poet, she knew nothing of language, nothing of grammar -- it was just an outpouring of her madness. But she was so madly in love with god that that very love made the great poetry, the great singing, the great dancing. Everybody thought that she had gone mad. Even her family tried to kill her because she was becoming notorious: a queen dancing on the streets, mixing with beggars, sleeping in caravanserais, moving with ordinary people. It was unbearable for the family and they tried to kill her.\nAnd the story is that they sent poison with a message that just for their sake to drink it and be finished.\nMeera sang a song and drank the poison. And the story is that the poison did not affect her. It is possible, it may not have affected her. Mad people don't follow simple laws. Her love was so great that the poison may not have been able to destroy it. Her love was so great, her trust was so total that even poison became nectar.\nThat is the meaning of your name: a little touch of madness, a little touch of love, a little insanity so that you can have a communion with the whole.\nMy sannyasins have to learn to be both sane as far as the world is concerned and insane as far as their real interiority is concerned; logical with the world but very illogical with the ultimate.\n(Then Osho addresses Prem Satyo. His name means love is truth.) If one is capable of love one is capable of knowing the truth. There is no other way, there is no other approach. Truth comes second, love comes first. Love prepares your heart to receive the guest. Love makes you the host. And the moment the host is ready the guest comes. It has never been otherwise.\nBuddha used to say ' ais dhammo sanantano' -- this is the law, the ultimate law of life, the moment the guest is ready the guest is bound to come. You need not go anywhere; just be ready to receive. Love makes you receptive, open, vulnerable, trusting.\n(Love is dangerous -- love for the ultimate truth is the ultimate risk.) It is dangerous because we have been brought up with so many prejudices, a priori conclusions, conditionings, beliefs, that if one really loves truth one will have to renounce all this. One will have to renounce one's whole past. That is really hard work, an uphill task, because we have become so identified with our past. Those beliefs are no more separate like clothes that we can take off any moment. Those beliefs have become almost like our skin, and to peel the skin off hurts.\nBertrand Russell, one of the greatest philosophers of this age, says he is not a Christian, he dropped all that nonsense long ago. But if somebody says something against Christ, still, something in him hurts. He himself has written a book 'WHY I AM NOT A CHRISTIAN'. And he has said many things against Christ and Christianity, but if somebody else says the same things it hurts.\nBeliefs slowly sink so deep in you that even if you consciously drop them they go on lingering in your 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nunconsciousness. And a true seeker, a true lover of truth, has to renounce them root and all. One has to be completely clean of all beliefs because all belief, are lies. Truth is never a belief, it is an experience, and before that experience can happen you have to pay this price of dropping all beliefs. That's why I say love for truth is the most adventurous thing in life. But the risk is worth taking.\nLies can at the most be comfortable, but they cannot give you bliss, they cannot give you freedom, they cannot give you god. And without these values life is empty. One can drag but one cannot dance, and unless your life becomes a dance you have missed the whole opportunity.\nMy sannyasins have to be dancers, celebrants. THE PRESENTS OF HIS PRESENCE\n(Anugraho means gratitude. It's the foundation of religion. Osho is talking to a New Zealand sannyasin.) Gratitude is the most essential core -- because it is out\nof gratitude that prayer arises.\nPeople are very ungrateful; they don't feel any gratitude for existence at all. The whole sky is full of stars and no thankyou arises in their hearts. It is as if their hearts are non-functioning. The sun rises with such tremendous beauty, the birds sing, the flowers open, only man remains closed, without any song, as if love has died in him.\nAnd these same people who cannot see the beauty of a sunrise or a sunset, who cannot feel grateful to the stars, to the clouds, to the trees, to people, to animals -\n- these same people go to the churches and the temples and the mosques to pray. How can I believe that their prayer can have any meaning? If sometimes they have not felt like kneeling down on the earth, if sometimes they have not felt like dancing with joy under the stars, all their prayers are false, formal. They are just being hypocrites and nothing else.\nSo I don't teach you to go to any church or to any temple. I teach you gratitude. And then there is no need to go anywhere. Just sitting here silently, the sound of the silence of the night is enough, more than enough, in fact uncontainable. If one has a heart one will feel the presence of god in this silence. And that feeling of the presence of god is what transforms a man -- not a belief but the experience.\nSo let this be the keyword for you, Anugraho -- gratitude. And if you can feel gratitude then many things will come to you of their own accord. They come spontaneously, without any search on your part.\nAnd when things happen of their own accord they have a totally different fragrance to them. They are gifts from the beyond.\nBLISS BALM\nOne cannot achieve bliss on one's own. We can achieve misery but not bliss. We can do something to ourselves so that we fall sick. But healing does not happen through us, it happens through the whole, it comes from the beyond. Wounds we can create -- that is within our power -- but when the wound heals it is not you who is healing it It heals by some mysterious energy. That mysterious energy is called god. It is only a name for all that is mysterious, and by mysterious I mean all that which is not comprehensible to reason.\nHow a wound heals is a miracle, how the illness disappears and health comes back is a miracle. Even medical science accepts the fact that we can help the healing process but we cannot heal. We can remove the barriers, we can prepare the ground for the healing energy to function, but the healing energy does everything on its own.\nBliss is the ultimate healing when all your bones have been healed, then there is no more any wound, when your whole being is full of well-being. It happens through god, through the beyond.\nThe function for you is to remove all hindrances. That's the work of the sannyasin -- not to create barriers for the healing energy. For example, when the sun rises you can keep your eyes closed; you will remain in darkness, although the sun is there, available. But you have to open your eyes, and opening your eyes is just removing a small hindrance; the eyelid is just a small hindrance. You can keep your doors closed and then even in the full light of the day you will live in darkness. But you can open the door, you can open all the windows, and then the sun and the wind and the rain come in.\nThat's what we can do: we can open up to existence, we can become available to all the energies that are showering on us, and then healing happens on its own. It is always god who heals. And bliss is the ultimate 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nexperience when you are totally healed, when nothing is missing, when one has come home.\nA DARLING OF THE COSMOS\n(... but a danger to the crowd -- that's the fate of the blissful man.) Bliss needs a very strong spirit. Any coward can afford to be miserable. It needs no courage, no guts to be miserable; it is so easy and so cheap. That's why millions of people are miserable -- because it is so easily available. You don't have to do anything at all; you don't even have to search for it, it searches for you. You just have to be a coward and it will find you.\nBut to be blissful one really needs a strong spirit, for two reasons. One is: the whole of humanity is accustomed to living in misery and if you want to live in bliss you will have to go against it; in many ways you will have to leave the fold, the crowd, the mob.\nThere are many kinds of crowds: Christian, Hindu, Mohammedan, Communist, Socialist, Fascist -- all are crowds. The miserable person cannot be alone; he is so cowardly he always wants to belong to a crowd.\nThe blissful person is like a lion. Gautam the Buddha has actually used the words 'lion's roar' for the person who attains to bliss. He roars like a lion, he is no more a sheep. Sheep are always afraid of being alone; they move in a crowd. It gives them a feeling that they are not in danger, it is a kind of security because so many sheep are around them, they are not alone.\nThe first thing for being blissful is to be ready to go on a lonely path. Sannyas is initiation into being an individual, dropping out of the mass mind. The mob is the ugliest phenomenon in the world, it is the lowest possibility of humanity, but whenever you want to be alone and you want to leave the mob, the mob will not allow it easily. Hence the second problem: the mob will create every hindrance. If there is a need, the mob may even kill you -- it has killed many people -- for the simple reason that even if one person escapes from the fold and becomes blissful then the whole foundation of the crowd is shaken. Then others may start thinking of the same too, then others may start dreaming about being individuals. It is because of this that Jesus is crucified, it is because of this that Socrates is killed, it is because of this that Al Hillaj Mansoor is murdered. Their very presence is dangerous to the establishment; they are so blissful, naturally their presence is a kind of spell. People can become hypnotised, people can start moving in the same direction in which they have moved, and the crowd becomes afraid. Its fold is lo s ing its hold, and no crowd ever wants to lose its hold because in the crowd there are politicians who are politically powerful leaders, then there are priests who are religiously, spiritually powerful, then there are rich people, respectable people, saints and so on and so forth -- and they all depend on the mob psychology.\nThe blissful person is a danger to all of them.\nSo these are the two things -- this is why a strong spirit is needed -- the first, to go against the crowd, then the second, to be ready to sacrifice whatsoever the\ncrowd demands. One thing is certain, that there is nothing more valuable than bliss, so everything can be sacrificed for it, even life itself. It is far better to be crucified like Jesus than crowned like Alexander the Great. The crucifixion of Jesus is far more beautiful than the crowning of Alexander. Alexander is still a beggar, even though crowned; Jesus is still the emperor, though crucified.\nGoing All the Way Chapter #14\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3493","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/going_all_the_way/part13/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/going_all_the_way/>Going All The Way</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>17 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3493 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Going_All_The_Way/part13.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part12>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

god -- that's a by-product.</p><p>MEDITATION: A WHETSTONE FOR YOUR WITS</p><p>A man without meditation is bound to be mediocre, he cannot be
bright, because meditation is the art of sharpening your intelligence;
without meditation intelligence gathers rust. Then it is like a sword
which has not been used. It is only a sword in name; it is absolutely
useless.</p><p>The same is true about intelligence, it has to be continuously
sharpened; and the only way to sharpen it is to accept the challenges of
life meditatively. And by meditation I mean in deep silence, in
calmness, quietness. Whenever a challenge is accepted in a calm and
quiet way it sharpens your intelligence. It is not a disturbance, it is
not a curse, it is a blessing.</p><p>Meditation only teaches you the simple art of remaining centred in
the turmoil of life. It teaches you to be a centre, always a centre in
all kinds of cyclones. If you become disturbed you lose the opportunity,
you become confused, unfamiliar, clouded; and that's how dust gathers.
If you remain calm and quiet, as if nothing is happening to you -- you
are only watching something on the TV screen -- then it gives sharpness,
brightness. A moment comes when your inner brightness is so much that it
becomes almost an explosion of light. Hence the word 'enlightenment';
that is the ultimate peak to which meditation can bring you.</p><p>Meditation is climbing the mountain towards the sunlit peak. JUST
GOOD FRIENDS</p><p>The man of meditation inevitably becomes a friend to existence, a
friend to all. He loses enmity in him, so much so that even where there
is a need he can at the most pretend, but deep inside he cannot feel
enmity. He can act if there is a need</p><p>-- and that's my understanding about many things which Christians are
incapable of explaining about Jesus.</p><p>He taught about love, he taught about compassion, still he threw the
moneychangers out of the temple violently. He said to his disciples if
somebody hits you on one of your cheeks give him the other too. The same
man took a whip in his hand and became so enraged with the moneychangers
that single- handedly he threw them all out of the temple, turned their
boards upside down and threw their money. He must have been really
angry. Christians cannot explain how such a man like Jesus could have
done it.</p><p>My own experience is he could pretend, he was pretending. He was not
doing it, he was acting it -- it was needed. But he was not an enemy to
anybody; he could not be.</p><p>One of the famous Sufi mystics, Rabiya el Adawiya, changed a few
sentences in the Koran; wherever it said hate the enemy, the devil,
Satan, she changed it, she removed it Another mystic, Hasan, was looking
into Rabiya's copy of the Koran</p><p>-- he could not believe his eyes, because this was sacrilegious. You
cannot correct the Koran, no Mohammedan can think of it, because it is
god's word -- who are you to correct it?</p><p>He asked Rabiya 'Who has destroyed your copy? Do you ever look into
your copy or not? In many places I see a few words have been cut
out.'</p><p>Rabiya said 'Nobody else has done it but myself. I had to do it
because since I have known silence, since I have known god, I cannot
hate. And this is <em>my</em> copy, it is nobody else's business. I have
to change it according to my deepening consciousness. It may have been
right when I knew nothing of meditation but now it is no more right.
Even if the devil appears before me I can only love, I can only be
friendly. I would welcome him the same way I have welcomed <em>you</em>,
Hasan,' she said. 'I would ask him to rest, to relax, I would ask him to
be my honourable guest; I would serve him. I cannot hate.'</p><p>Meditation makes you a friend to the whole existence. And that is the
most beautiful experience -- when there is no hatred left in you.
Thousands of flowers</p><p>bloom in your being, all thorns start opening lie flowers.</p><p>This is the transformation that sannyas is aiming at, this is the
goal. LOONEY AS A LOVER</p><p>(Sannyas is marriage to the unknown and the unknowable; it is falling
in love with existence, Osho tells Deva Parinita.)</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on

affair.</p><p>The ultimate secrets are open only to lovers, not to logicians. And
if one wants to get the deepest into existence then a certain quality of
madness is a must. In fact the person who is perfectly sane is insane;
to be absolutely sane means to be just shallow, empty, meaningless,
because the perfectly sane person will not have any poetry in his life,
will not have any love in his life, will not have any celebration in his
life. It is not possible for him. For that you need a little touch of
madness. Just a little touch of madness and closed doors start
opening!</p><p>I teach the madness called love, the madness called meditation. These
are all mad things, that's why only a very few chosen people have ever
tried them; the majority never bothers about these things. They are
calculators, business people, mathematicians. They cannot understand
what you are doing. A businessman looking at Buddha meditating under his
tree with closed eyes sitting for hours will think he is a fool. In fact
in the Hindi language the word 'fool' comes from 'Buddha'. 'Buddha'
means the awakened one and from the same root comes 'buddhu' -- Buddhu
means the fool.</p><p>There were two types of people: a few thought Buddha was awakened and
a few thought he was just a fool, hence from the same root both words
have arisen. But the majority agreed that he was a fool. His father
thought he was a fool, his wife thought he was a fool. In fact anybody
would have thought him a fool</p><p>-- escaping from a beautiful wife, child, kingdom, palace, all the
luxuries and then just sitting under a tree like a beggar. What kind of
sanity was that?</p><p>One of the most beautiful women India has given birth to was Meera.
She was a queen and she left the palace and danced over streets and
villages singing songs of god. She sang the most beautiful songs -- I
have never come across anything more poetic. And she was not a poet, she
knew nothing of language, nothing of grammar -- it was just an
outpouring of her madness. But she was so madly in love with god that
that very love made the great poetry, the great singing, the great
dancing. Everybody thought that she had gone mad. Even her family tried
to kill her because she was becoming notorious: a queen dancing on the
streets, mixing with beggars, sleeping in caravanserais, moving with
ordinary people. It was unbearable for the family and they tried to kill
her.</p><p>And the story is that they sent poison with a message that just for
their sake to drink it and be finished.</p><p>Meera sang a song and drank the poison. And the story is that the
poison did not affect her. It is possible, it may not have affected her.
Mad people don't follow simple laws. Her love was so great that the
poison may not have been able to destroy it. Her love was so great, her
trust was so total that even poison became nectar.</p><p>That is the meaning of your name: a little touch of madness, a little
touch of love, a little insanity so that you can have a communion with
the whole.</p><p>My sannyasins have to learn to be both sane as far as the world is
concerned and insane as far as their real interiority is concerned;
logical with the world but very illogical with the ultimate.</p><p>(Then Osho addresses Prem Satyo. His name means love is truth.) If
one is capable of love one is capable of knowing the truth. There is no
other way, there is no other approach. Truth comes second, love comes
first. Love prepares your heart to receive the guest. Love makes you the
host. And the moment the host is ready the guest comes. It has never
been otherwise.</p><p>Buddha used to say ' <em>ais dhammo sanantano</em>' -- this is the
law, the ultimate law of life, the moment the guest is ready the guest
is bound to come. You need not go anywhere; just be ready to receive.
Love makes you receptive, open, vulnerable, trusting.</p><p>(Love is dangerous -- love for the ultimate truth is the ultimate
risk.) It is dangerous because we have been brought up with so many
prejudices, a priori conclusions, conditionings, beliefs, that if one
really loves truth one will have to renounce all this. One will have to
renounce one's whole past. That is really hard work, an uphill task,
because we have become so identified with our past. Those beliefs are no
more separate like clothes that we can take off any moment. Those
beliefs have become almost like our skin, and to peel the skin off
hurts.</p><p>Bertrand Russell, one of the greatest philosophers of this age, says
he is not a Christian, he dropped all that nonsense long ago. But if
somebody says something against Christ, still, something in him hurts.
He himself has written a book 'WHY I AM NOT A CHRISTIAN'. And he has
said many things against Christ and Christianity, but if somebody else
says the same things it hurts.</p><p>Beliefs slowly sink so deep in you that even if you consciously drop
them they go on lingering in your 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

renounce them root and all. One has to be completely clean of all
beliefs because all belief, are lies. Truth is never a belief, it is an
experience, and before that experience can happen you have to pay this
price of dropping all beliefs. That's why I say love for truth is the
most adventurous thing in life. But the risk is worth taking.</p><p>Lies can at the most be comfortable, but they cannot give you bliss,
they cannot give you freedom, they cannot give you god. And without
these values life is empty. One can drag but one cannot dance, and
unless your life becomes a dance you have missed the whole
opportunity.</p><p>My sannyasins have to be dancers, celebrants. THE PRESENTS OF HIS
PRESENCE</p><p>(Anugraho means gratitude. It's the foundation of religion. Osho is
talking to a New Zealand sannyasin.) Gratitude is the most essential
core -- because it is out</p><p>of gratitude that prayer arises.</p><p>People are very ungrateful; they don't feel any gratitude for
existence at all. The whole sky is full of stars and no thankyou arises
in their hearts. It is as if their hearts are non-functioning. The sun
rises with such tremendous beauty, the birds sing, the flowers open,
only man remains closed, without any song, as if love has died in
him.</p><p>And these same people who cannot see the beauty of a sunrise or a
sunset, who cannot feel grateful to the stars, to the clouds, to the
trees, to people, to animals -</p><p>- these same people go to the churches and the temples and the
mosques to pray. How can I believe that their prayer can have any
meaning? If sometimes they have not felt like kneeling down on the
earth, if sometimes they have not felt like dancing with joy under the
stars, all their prayers are false, formal. They are just being
hypocrites and nothing else.</p><p>So I don't teach you to go to any church or to any temple. I teach
you gratitude. And then there is no need to go anywhere. Just sitting
here silently, the sound of the silence of the night is enough, more
than enough, in fact uncontainable. If one has a heart one will feel the
presence of god in this silence. And that feeling of the presence of god
is what transforms a man -- not a belief but the experience.</p><p>So let this be the keyword for you, Anugraho -- gratitude. And if you
can feel gratitude then many things will come to you of their own
accord. They come spontaneously, without any search on your part.</p><p>And when things happen of their own accord they have a totally
different fragrance to them. They are gifts from the beyond.</p><p>BLISS BALM</p><p>One cannot achieve bliss on one's own. We can achieve misery but not
bliss. We can do something to ourselves so that we fall sick. But
healing does not happen through us, it happens through the whole, it
comes from the beyond. Wounds we can create -- that is within our power
-- but when the wound heals it is not you who is healing it It heals by
some mysterious energy. That mysterious energy is called god. It is only
a name for all that is mysterious, and by mysterious I mean all that
which is not comprehensible to reason.</p><p>How a wound heals is a miracle, how the illness disappears and health
comes back is a miracle. Even medical science accepts the fact that we
can help the healing process but we cannot heal. We can remove the
barriers, we can prepare the ground for the healing energy to function,
but the healing energy does everything on its own.</p><p>Bliss is the ultimate healing when all your bones have been healed,
then there is no more any wound, when your whole being is full of
well-being. It happens through god, through the beyond.</p><p>The function for you is to remove all hindrances. That's the work of
the sannyasin -- not to create barriers for the healing energy. For
example, when the sun rises you can keep your eyes closed; you will
remain in darkness, although the sun is there, available. But you have
to open your eyes, and opening your eyes is just removing a small
hindrance; the eyelid is just a small hindrance. You can keep your doors
closed and then even in the full light of the day you will live in
darkness. But you can open the door, you can open all the windows, and
then the sun and the wind and the rain come in.</p><p>That's what <em>we</em> can do: we can open up to existence, we can
become available to all the energies that are showering on us, and then
healing happens on its own. It is always god who heals. And bliss is the
ultimate 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on

one has come home.</p><p>A DARLING OF THE COSMOS</p><p>(... but a danger to the crowd -- that's the fate of the blissful
man.) Bliss needs a very strong spirit. Any coward can afford to be
miserable. It needs no courage, no guts to be miserable; it is so easy
and so cheap. That's why millions of people are miserable -- because it
is so easily available. You don't have to do anything at all; you don't
even have to search for it, it searches for you. You just have to be a
coward and it will find you.</p><p>But to be blissful one <em>really</em> needs a strong spirit, for two
reasons. One is: the whole of humanity is accustomed to living in misery
and if you want to live in bliss you will have to go against it; in many
ways you will have to leave the fold, the crowd, the mob.</p><p>There are many kinds of crowds: Christian, Hindu, Mohammedan,
Communist, Socialist, Fascist -- all are crowds. The miserable person
cannot be alone; he is so cowardly he always wants to belong to a
crowd.</p><p>The blissful person is like a lion. Gautam the Buddha has actually
used the words 'lion's roar' for the person who attains to bliss. He
roars like a lion, he is no more a sheep. Sheep are always afraid of
being alone; they move in a crowd. It gives them a feeling that they are
not in danger, it is a kind of security because so many sheep are around
them, they are not alone.</p><p>The first thing for being blissful is to be ready to go on a lonely
path. Sannyas is initiation into being an individual, dropping out of
the mass mind. The mob is the ugliest phenomenon in the world, it is the
lowest possibility of humanity, but whenever you want to be alone and
you want to leave the mob, the mob will not allow it easily. Hence the
second problem: the mob will create every hindrance. If there is a need,
the mob may even kill you -- it has killed many people -- for the simple
reason that even if one person escapes from the fold and becomes
blissful then the whole foundation of the crowd is shaken. Then others
may start thinking of the same too, then others may start dreaming about
being individuals. It is because of this that Jesus is crucified, it is
because of this that Socrates is killed, it is because of this that Al
Hillaj Mansoor is murdered. Their very presence is dangerous to the
establishment; they are <em>so</em> blissful, naturally their presence
is a kind of spell. People can become hypnotised, people can start
moving in the same direction in which they have moved, and the crowd
becomes afraid. Its fold is lo s ing its hold, and no crowd ever wants
to lose its hold because in the crowd there are politicians who are
politically powerful leaders, then there are priests who are
religiously, spiritually powerful, then there are rich people,
respectable people, saints and so on and so forth -- and they all depend
on the mob psychology.</p><p>The blissful person is a danger to all of them.</p><p>So these are the two things -- this is why a strong spirit is needed
-- the first, to go against the crowd, then the second, to be ready to
sacrifice whatsoever the</p><p>crowd demands. One thing is certain, that there is nothing more
valuable than bliss, so everything can be sacrificed for it, even life
itself. It is far better to be crucified like Jesus than crowned like
Alexander the Great. The crucifixion of Jesus is far more beautiful than
the crowning of Alexander. Alexander is still a beggar, even though
crowned; Jesus is still the emperor, though crucified.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=going-all-the-way>Going All the Way</h3><p>Chapter #14</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part12>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

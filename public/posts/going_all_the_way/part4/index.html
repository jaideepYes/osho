These are the two possibilities, either one can be an ego or one can be a zero. The egoist cannot be a disciple. To be a disciple means readiness to learn, openness to learn -- and the egoist is closed. In his ego , cannot accept that he does not know -- and that is most fundamental requirement for learning, to know that you don't know. Only from that state of not-knowing does disciplehood begin; that is the very seed of disciplehood -- the state of not-knowing. And the ego is always pretending to be knowledgeable. It knows nothing but believes that it knows.\nThe other possibility is just to be a zero a nobody, utterly empty. In that emptiness learning is possible, the contact with the master is possible, the communion is possible, the transmission of the truth beyond words is possible.\nInitiation into sannyas means readiness to become a zero and then disciplehood comes of its own accord.\nDISCIPLESHIP... OR SANNYAS STREAM\n(Some more pointers about being a sannyasin.)\nSannyas means not to cling to anything, not to be in any way attached to anything, always flowing, not making a home, moving like a river.\nLife is dynamic and the moment you stop it it loses something tremendously significant; then it is no more a river, it becomes a lake. The lake is closed, the river was open; the lake will never reach to the ocean the river would certainly have reached. The river was growing; the lake is stagnant, in a sense dead.\nThe sannyasin has to be riverlike, always moving from the familiar towards the unfamiliar. Enjoy wherever you are but always remember it is only a caravanserai, an overnight stay, and in the morning we go, so there is no need to cling. We are just travellers. Only the Way belongs to us and nothing else.\nThis should be so in all the dimensions of life. Then it becomes your very style of living -- unclinging, unattached, flowing, dynamic, moving, always moving from the known to the unknown and ultimate from the unknown to the unknowable -- then one has learned the very essence of sannyas. It is perpetual growth, it is eternal pilgrimage.\nMIND IS AN HEIR CONDITIONING\n(While meditation is dropping your head, Osho talks about the two ways in which consciousness can function.)\nWhen consciousness functions as a mind it functions through prejudices, a priori ideas, conditionings --\nCatholic, Protestant, Hindu, Mohammedan, Communist, theist, atheist. There are layers and layers of conditionings and they are not even consistent with each\nother.\nYou may have been conditioned by many people. One of your conditioners may have been a Christian and another may have been a Hindu; you may have been reading the Bhagavad Gita, the Koran, the Bible, the Dhammapada; you may have been brought up by Catholic parents but you may have studied in a Protestant school. And then there are a thousand and one ideologies in the air; and the mind is very vulnerable, it goes on catching everything, it goes on accumulating. Hence all those layers are not even consistent with each other; they are contradictory.\nMind is a chaos, it is noisy. And every part of it is trying to dominate. There is continuous war -- who is going to win? The atheist or the theist, the Catholic or the Communist -- who is going to win? Nobody can ever win, but this whole fight in yourself destroys your energy. It depletes you, it leaves you exhausted; it leaves you without any vigour, without any freshness, it tires you. Life becomes a drag; somehow one goes on pulling oneself together. And that togetherness also cannot be taken for granted.\nA small incident may prove the last straw on the camel and one may go insane... because people are almost boiling, near about one-hundred degrees. Just a little incident -- your lover leaves you, your bank fails, your business goes bankrupt -- anything is enough to bring one to that point where one passes over the 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nboundary of sanity into insanity... because the difference is only of degrees. The difference is not qualitative, it is only quantitative.\nTo live through the mind is to live an insane life, out of chaos, with no meaning, no significance. But there is also another way -- that's what meditation is. Meditation means living directly, immediately, putting the mind aside, responding to reality without any prejudices, seeing things as they are, not as you would like them to be, not according to your expectations but just as they are.\nThe whole art of meditation is to see things just as they are, without any interference, without any distortion -- and then life becomes something totally different. It moves into a new dimension. You are full of energy because all that conflict is finished, all that chaos is gone -- you have bypassed it -- there is great silence. And in that silence there is joy, in that silence there is understanding, in that silence there is clarity.\nYou can see who you are, where you are, why you are. All these questions simply disappear. Not that you have found some answers in the scriptures but the ultimate answer, which dissolved all questions, has arisen in you.\nAnd Maila means fragrance. To live a life of meditativeness is to live a life of fragrance. The mind stinks, it is a rotten gutter. No-mind is the opening of your consciousness. It opens like a flower: there is a great release of fragrance. Your whole life becomes fragrant with bliss, with truth, with love, with freedom, with all that is worth having, with all that is timeless, indestructible, eternal.\nGRACE IS OUR ORIGINAL FACE\n(Again this evening Osho talks on the authentic beauty.) Beauty is physical, grace is spiritual. It is beauty but on a totally different plane. Beauty is your exterior expression, grace is your lnteriority. Beauty can be thought of as a circumference, grace is the centre. Hence one can pretend to be beautiful but one cannot pretend to be graceful. One can create a false beauty, pseudo.\nIt is just an appearance and it can deceive others but it cannot deceive you. You can have a beautiful mask --\nothers may be deceived, but you will know all the time that you are wearing a mask, it is not your original face.\nGrace cannot be cultivated, it cannot be invented; it has to be discovered. It is divine. It is already there; we just have to dig deep enough into our own being. It is exactly like the process of digging a well in the earths the water is already there, you just have to remove a few layers of the earth, a few rocks, stones, and suddenly the water appears. In the same way grace is already a gift of god; it is there -- we have to discover it.\nSannyas is the discovery of grace. And once you have found your centre then it starts radiating, then it starts transforming your circumference too. Then you\nneed not pretend to be beautiful, your grace is enough. It starts changing your behaviour and your actions; even your physical body goes through a radical change. And the beauty that comes out of grace is something of a tremendous value because it is truly sos it is your original face, your real nature.\nRemember one fundamental laws the pseudo, the false, the unreal, the untrue, always create, a prison for you, the real, the authentic, the true, always brings freedom.\nJesus says truth liberates. That seems to be one of the most important sayings out of all his sayings truth liberates. And then we can see that untruth must create bondage.\nDrop the untrue and search for, seek, the true. LAUGHTER IS HIS LITURGY\n(Osho shares his vision of real spirituality.)\nMy religion consists of blissfulness. It has nothing to do with seriousness, it is against seriousness. To me seriousness is a sin, and blissfulness is the greatest virtue. Hence my effort is to create saints who are capable of laughing, singing, dancing.\nIn the past the saints have been very boring, they have been heavy, dark, dismal. They have burdened humanity's heart; they have destroyed all cheerfulness, playfulness, joyousness. They were all against laughter. To them laughter seemed to be something irreligious.\nTo me laughter is a form of prayer. In fact I know only very few things which the quality of laughter.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nWhen you totally laugh the ego disappears. In that moment there is no ego, there is no one who is laughing, there is only laughter. Yes, when you try to laugh that is another matter; then you are there. If you are just laughing because others are laughing then you are there. If you are just laughing to be polite, then you are there. But if the laughter is happening then you dissolve in it.\nAny action that helps you dissolve the ego is prayer.\nI am not interested in the other world, my interest is here, now this moment is my total interest. This moment has to be lived joyously because the next moment will be born out of it. So why care about the next? If this moment is full of joy and dance and song, the next will be more so!\nDon't destroy this moment for the future. That is one of the ancient habits of humanity and religions have been teaching this. They say this life is mundane, worldly, materialist and to be interested in it is not good; sacrifice this life for the life beyond. That's how they have made the whole of humanity miserable.\nI say sacrifice all beyonds for this moment. There is no other time than this, no other place than this.\nWhen one lives with such totality, intensity, passion, one's life becomes aflame with cheerfulness and joy.\nAnd when the next life comes we will be there so we will see how to dance, how to sing; we will celebrate that too. The best way to prepare for the other life is to dance and sing and love and laugh here, otherwise where are you going to do the rehearsal? Practise here!\nMy feeling is that if your so-called saints enter heaven they will not be able to laugh even there, they would have forgotten how to laugh. They will not be able to dance or sing. They will have completely lost track of those dimensions.\nSo this is going to be your religion. So the more blissful you are, the closer you are to me. I don't teach any doctrine, just a way of life, a way of love, a way of laughter.\nPRAYER IS THE OUTPOURING OF GLEE\n(Not a petition or plea. Osho goes on to talk of true prayer to Swami Vandano.)\nThe prayer that is prevalent in the world, in the churches, in the temples, in the mosques, is not true prayer because there is desire in it. People pray to god only to get something, and the moment you pray to get something you have destroyed your prayer. It is a business proposal. It is buttressing god as if god is an ego, praising god in order to persuade him to do some favour for you. It is sheer stupidity!\nThe real prayer is a thankfulness, not a desire at all. When you start feeling how much the universe has given to you already without your asking you feel gratitude. To show that gratitude is real prayer, authentic prayer; even words are not needed, but just the feel the feel of gratitude.\nYes, sometimes it overwhelms one and one would like to dance and sing in praise of god, but for no other reason; just because one is so full of thankfulness that one cannot contain it and it starts overflowing.\nThat is true prayer. Sometimes one may simply bow down to the earth or lie down on the earth like a small child lying on the breast of the mother, resting, feeling a deep communion with the earth -- a silent thankfulness. Nothing is said but all is heard.\nThat is the meaning of Vandano. Learn true prayer, learn thankfulness, gratitude. LOVE A WAY, BECAUSE LOVE IS THE WAY\n(The way to god, to truth, and to freedom, Osho tells Prem Marga.) If one can love unconditionally then there is no need of any Christianity, Hinduism or Mohammedanism in the world. Because man have forgotten how to love, all these religions exist.\nLove is spiritual health. And when you are not healthy of course there will be many doctors and many physicians and many 'pathies' -- and they are all going to exploit you. In the name of helping you they will exploit you, when the simple thing is to learn ways of loving. Only a few things have to be dropped and love becomes possible.\nOne has to drop any motivation; one has to love for love's sake. If there is a motive it is greed, it is not love. One has to drop possessiveness. If there is possessiveness you don't love, because to possess somebody means to reduce him to a thing, and no lover can do that -- it is murder!\nDrop jealousy and love wells up. Jealousy means that I am the owner. It is an ego trip, and wherever there is ego there is poison, and the poison kills the very source of love. One has to become aware of just 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nthese few things and discard them and one's life becomes a lotus of love. And then there is no need to go in any search of god, god will come in search of you.\nThis is my observation, that god always comes seeking the true seeker. Whenever the disciple is ready the master appears.\nPURITY IS MENTAL NUDITY\n(It has nothing to do with morality, which is something calculated.) There are thousands of moralities in the world. The Hindu has one morality, the Christian another, the Buddhist still another.\nPurity can be only one. The blank paper can be only one. Yes, writing can differ; one can write Arabic or Sanskrit or Greek or Latin, one can quote the Bible or the Vedas or the Gita or the Koran, but if the paper is blank then it is always the same: two blank papers have no difference. To me purity means a mind which is like a blank paper; nothing is written on it. Morality is a writing, immorality is also a writing.\nAnd one thing is immoral in one place, the same thing is moral in another place. In fact I have never come across a single thing which has not been considered moral somewhere at some period of history, and vice versa; neither have I come across a single thing which has not been considered immoral somewhere in some time of history. So it all depends. These are man's ideas about what is right and what is wrong.\nTo be pure means to be empty of all ideas. It is going beyond the moral and the immoral, it is simple silence. It is erasing all writing, cleaning your slate.\nIn a small school the teacher told the small children to write down what they\nwould do if they were a very rich man, a millionaire. The children started writing thousands of fantasies. Somebody thought to go around the world, somebody thought to go to the moon, somebody thought to purchase an aeroplane or this and that. Just one child wag sitting doing nothing. The teacher said 'Why are you not writing?' He said 'This is what I would do if I were a millionaire -- I would not do anything at all! That child had some insight!\nThe real purity is a state of non-doing, a state of non-thinking, a state of just awareness without any content, consciousness without any content. And to achieve it is the ultimate achievement; there is nothing higher than that. Once you have known it, all is known to you.\nMUD CAN MOTHER MIRACLES\n(Blossoms and Buddhas are born of it. Osho is addressing Ma Kamalesh from Japan.) The lotus is very symbolic. First, it grows out of dirty mud. It is a miracle. Looking at the dirty and nobody could conceive that such a beautiful flower could come out of it. And the same is true about man: in his unconsciousness he is nothing but dirty mud; when he becomes conscious, awakened, a Buddha, he becomes a lotus. It is almost inconceivable that the ordinary unconscious man can attain to such heights of blissfulness.\nSecondly, the lotus grows in water, floats on the water, but is so velvety that the water doesn't touch it.\nEven in the morning when you see dewdrops gathered on the lotus leaves they are there like pearls, separate; they don't even make the lotus petal wet. That is the second meaning of the lotus, a sannyasin has to live in the world in such a way that nothing touches him. The escapist is not a true sannyasin, he who runs away from the world is a coward.\nLive in the world, accept its challenge, but be a lotus. Remember these two things and just these two things are enough to transform your whole life.\nThe first will remind you of your ultimate potential and the second will show you the way to reach it.\n-- How long will you be here?\n-- I don't know.\n-- Then be here forever. I like people who don't know! This is the place for people who don't know anything at all. I am collecting all these not-knowing people around me... So become part of this madhouse!\n(laughter) Good! 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nGoing All the Way Chapter #5\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3122","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/going_all_the_way/part4/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/going_all_the_way/>Going All The Way</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>15 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3122 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Going_All_The_Way/part4.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part3>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

moving, always moving from the known to the unknown and ultimate from
the unknown to the unknowable -- then one has learned the very essence
of sannyas. It is perpetual growth, it is eternal pilgrimage.</p><p>MIND IS AN HEIR CONDITIONING</p><p>(While meditation is dropping your head, Osho talks about the two
ways in which consciousness can function.)</p><p>When consciousness functions as a mind it functions through
prejudices, a priori ideas, conditionings --</p><p>Catholic, Protestant, Hindu, Mohammedan, Communist, theist, atheist.
There are layers and layers of conditionings and they are not even
consistent with each</p><p>other.</p><p>You may have been conditioned by many people. One of your
conditioners may have been a Christian and another may have been a
Hindu; you may have been reading the Bhagavad Gita, the Koran, the
Bible, the Dhammapada; you may have been brought up by Catholic parents
but you may have studied in a Protestant school. And then there are a
thousand and one ideologies in the air; and the mind is very vulnerable,
it goes on catching everything, it goes on accumulating. Hence all those
layers are not even consistent with each other; they are
contradictory.</p><p>Mind is a chaos, it is noisy. And every part of it is trying to
dominate. There is continuous war -- who is going to win? The atheist or
the theist, the Catholic or the Communist -- who is going to win? Nobody
can ever win, but this whole fight in yourself destroys your energy. It
depletes you, it leaves you exhausted; it leaves you without any vigour,
without any freshness, it tires you. Life becomes a drag; somehow one
goes on pulling oneself together. And that togetherness also cannot be
taken for granted.</p><p>A small incident may prove the last straw on the camel and one may go
insane... because people are almost boiling, near about one-hundred
degrees. Just a little incident -- your lover leaves you, your bank
fails, your business goes bankrupt -- anything is enough to bring one to
that point where one passes over the 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>boundary of sanity into insanity... because the difference is only of
degrees. The difference is not qualitative, it is only quantitative.</p><p>To live through the mind is to live an insane life, out of chaos,
with no meaning, no significance. But there is also another way --
that's what meditation is. Meditation means living directly,
immediately, putting the mind aside, responding to reality without any
prejudices, seeing things as they are, not as you would like them to be,
not according to your expectations but just as they are.</p><p>The whole art of meditation is to see things just as they are,
without any interference, without any distortion -- and then life
becomes something totally different. It moves into a new dimension. You
are full of energy because all that conflict is finished, all that chaos
is gone -- you have bypassed it -- there is great silence. And in that
silence there is joy, in that silence there is understanding, in that
silence there is clarity.</p><p>You can see who you are, where you are, why you are. All these
questions simply disappear. Not that you have found some answers in the
scriptures but the ultimate answer, which dissolved all questions, has
arisen in you.</p><p>And Maila means fragrance. To live a life of meditativeness is to
live a life of fragrance. The mind stinks, it is a rotten gutter.
No-mind is the opening of your consciousness. It opens like a flower:
there is a great release of fragrance. Your whole life becomes fragrant
with bliss, with truth, with love, with freedom, with all that is worth
having, with all that is timeless, indestructible, eternal.</p><p>GRACE IS OUR ORIGINAL FACE</p><p>(Again this evening Osho talks on the authentic beauty.) Beauty is
physical, grace is spiritual. It is beauty but on a totally different
plane. Beauty is your exterior expression, grace is your lnteriority.
Beauty can be thought of as a circumference, grace is the centre. Hence
one can pretend to be beautiful but one cannot pretend to be graceful.
One can create a false beauty, pseudo.</p><p>It is just an appearance and it can deceive others but it cannot
deceive you. You can have a beautiful mask --</p><p>others may be deceived, but you will know all the time that you are
wearing a mask, it is not your original face.</p><p>Grace cannot be cultivated, it cannot be invented; it has to be
discovered. It is divine. It is already there; we just have to dig deep
enough into our own being. It is exactly like the process of digging a
well in the earths the water is already there, you just have to remove a
few layers of the earth, a few rocks, stones, and suddenly the water
appears. In the same way grace is already a gift of god; it is there --
we have to discover it.</p><p>Sannyas is the discovery of grace. And once you have found your
centre then it starts radiating, then it starts transforming your
circumference too. Then you</p><p>need not pretend to be beautiful, your grace is enough. It starts
changing your behaviour and your actions; even your physical body goes
through a radical change. And the beauty that comes out of grace is
something of a tremendous value because it is truly sos it is your
original face, your real nature.</p><p>Remember one fundamental laws the pseudo, the false, the unreal, the
untrue, always create, a prison for you, the real, the authentic, the
true, always brings freedom.</p><p>Jesus says truth liberates. That seems to be one of the most
important sayings out of all his sayings truth liberates. And then we
can see that untruth must create bondage.</p><p>Drop the untrue and search for, seek, the true. LAUGHTER IS HIS
LITURGY</p><p>(Osho shares his vision of real spirituality.)</p><p>My religion consists of blissfulness. It has nothing to do with
seriousness, it is against seriousness. To me seriousness is a sin, and
blissfulness is the greatest virtue. Hence my effort is to create saints
who are capable of laughing, singing, dancing.</p><p>In the past the saints have been very boring, they have been heavy,
dark, dismal. They have burdened humanity's heart; they have destroyed
all cheerfulness, playfulness, joyousness. They were all against
laughter. To them laughter seemed to be something irreligious.</p><p>To me laughter is a form of prayer. In fact I know only very few
things which the quality of laughter.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>When you totally laugh the ego disappears. In that moment there is no
ego, there is no one who is laughing, there is only laughter. Yes, when
you <em>try</em> to laugh that is another matter; then you are there. If
you are just laughing because others are laughing then you are there. If
you are just laughing to be polite, then you are there. But if the
laughter is happening then you dissolve in it.</p><p>Any action that helps you dissolve the ego is prayer.</p><p>I am not interested in the other world, my interest is here, now this
moment is my total interest. This moment has to be lived joyously
because the next moment will be born out of it. So why care about the
next? If this moment is full of joy and dance and song, the next will be
more so!</p><p>Don't destroy this moment for the future. That is one of the ancient
habits of humanity and religions have been teaching this. They say this
life is mundane, worldly, materialist and to be interested in it is not
good; sacrifice this life for the life beyond. That's how they have made
the whole of humanity miserable.</p><p>I say sacrifice all beyonds for this moment. There is no other time
than this, no other place than this.</p><p>When one lives with such totality, intensity, passion, one's life
becomes aflame with cheerfulness and joy.</p><p>And when the next life comes we will be there so we will see how to
dance, how to sing; we will celebrate that too. The best way to prepare
for the other life is to dance and sing and love and laugh
<em>here</em>, otherwise where are you going to do the rehearsal?
Practise here!</p><p>My feeling is that if your so-called saints enter heaven they will
not be able to laugh even there, they would have forgotten how to laugh.
They will not be able to dance or sing. They will have completely lost
track of those dimensions.</p><p>So this is going to be your religion. So the more blissful you are,
the closer you are to me. I don't teach any doctrine, just a way of
life, a way of love, a way of laughter.</p><p>PRAYER IS THE OUTPOURING OF GLEE</p><p>(Not a petition or plea. Osho goes on to talk of true prayer to Swami
Vandano.)</p><p>The prayer that is prevalent in the world, in the churches, in the
temples, in the mosques, is not true prayer because there is desire in
it. People pray to god only to get something, and the moment you pray to
get something you have destroyed your prayer. It is a business proposal.
It is buttressing god as if god is an ego, praising god in order to
persuade him to do some favour for you. It is sheer stupidity!</p><p>The real prayer is a thankfulness, not a desire at all. When you
start feeling how much the universe has given to you already without
your asking you feel gratitude. To show that gratitude is real prayer,
authentic prayer; even words are not needed, but just the feel the feel
of gratitude.</p><p>Yes, sometimes it overwhelms one and one would like to dance and sing
in praise of god, but for no other reason; just because one is so full
of thankfulness that one cannot contain it and it starts
overflowing.</p><p>That is true prayer. Sometimes one may simply bow down to the earth
or lie down on the earth like a small child lying on the breast of the
mother, resting, feeling a deep communion with the earth -- a silent
thankfulness. Nothing is said but all is heard.</p><p>That is the meaning of Vandano. Learn true prayer, learn
thankfulness, gratitude. LOVE A WAY, BECAUSE LOVE IS THE WAY</p><p>(The way to god, to truth, and to freedom, Osho tells Prem Marga.) If
one can love unconditionally then there is no need of any Christianity,
Hinduism or Mohammedanism in the world. Because man have forgotten how
to love, all these religions exist.</p><p>Love is spiritual health. And when you are not healthy of course
there will be many doctors and many physicians and many 'pathies' -- and
they are all going to exploit you. In the name of helping you they will
exploit you, when the simple thing is to learn ways of loving. Only a
few things have to be dropped and love becomes possible.</p><p>One has to drop any motivation; one has to love for love's sake. If
there is a motive it is greed, it is not love. One has to drop
possessiveness. If there is possessiveness you don't love, because to
possess somebody means to reduce him to a thing, and no lover can do
that -- it is murder!</p><p>Drop jealousy and love wells up. Jealousy means that I am the owner.
It is an ego trip, and wherever there is ego there is poison, and the
poison kills the very source of love. One has to become aware of just
1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>these few things and discard them and one's life becomes a lotus of
love. And then there is no need to go in any search of god, god will
come in search of you.</p><p>This is my observation, that god always comes seeking the true
seeker. Whenever the disciple is ready the master appears.</p><p>PURITY IS MENTAL NUDITY</p><p>(It has nothing to do with morality, which is something calculated.)
There are thousands of moralities in the world. The Hindu has one
morality, the Christian another, the Buddhist still another.</p><p>Purity can be only one. The blank paper can be only one. Yes, writing
can differ; one can write Arabic or Sanskrit or Greek or Latin, one can
quote the Bible or the Vedas or the Gita or the Koran, but if the paper
is blank then it is always the same: two blank papers have no
difference. To me purity means a mind which is like a blank paper;
nothing is written on it. Morality is a writing, immorality is also a
writing.</p><p>And one thing is immoral in one place, the same thing is moral in
another place. In fact I have never come across a single thing which has
not been considered moral somewhere at some period of history, and vice
versa; neither have I come across a single thing which has not been
considered immoral somewhere in some time of history. So it all depends.
These are man's ideas about what is right and what is wrong.</p><p>To be pure means to be empty of all ideas. It is going beyond the
moral and the immoral, it is simple silence. It is erasing all writing,
cleaning your slate.</p><p>In a small school the teacher told the small children to write down
what they</p><p>would do if they were a very rich man, a millionaire. The children
started writing thousands of fantasies. Somebody thought to go around
the world, somebody thought to go to the moon, somebody thought to
purchase an aeroplane or this and that. Just one child wag sitting doing
nothing. The teacher said 'Why are you not writing?' He said 'This is
what I would do if I were a millionaire -- I would not do anything at
all! That child had some insight!</p><p>The real purity is a state of non-doing, a state of non-thinking, a
state of just awareness without any content, consciousness without any
content. And to achieve it is the ultimate achievement; there is nothing
higher than that. Once you have known it, all is known to you.</p><p>MUD CAN MOTHER MIRACLES</p><p>(Blossoms and Buddhas are born of it. Osho is addressing Ma Kamalesh
from Japan.) The lotus is very symbolic. First, it grows out of dirty
mud. It is a miracle. Looking at the dirty and nobody could conceive
that such a beautiful flower could come out of it. And the same is true
about man: in his unconsciousness he is nothing but dirty mud; when he
becomes conscious, awakened, a Buddha, he becomes a lotus. It is almost
inconceivable that the ordinary unconscious man can attain to such
heights of blissfulness.</p><p>Secondly, the lotus grows in water, floats on the water, but is so
velvety that the water doesn't touch it.</p><p>Even in the morning when you see dewdrops gathered on the lotus
leaves they are there like pearls, separate; they don't even make the
lotus petal wet. That is the second meaning of the lotus, a sannyasin
has to live in the world in such a way that nothing touches him. The
escapist is not a true sannyasin, he who runs away from the world is a
coward.</p><p>Live in the world, accept its challenge, but be a lotus. Remember
these two things and just these two things are enough to transform your
whole life.</p><p>The first will remind you of your ultimate potential and the second
will show you the way to reach it.</p><p>-- How long will you be here?</p><p>-- I don't know.</p><p>-- Then be here forever. I like people who don't know! This is the
place for people who don't know anything at all. I am collecting all
these not-knowing people around me... So become part of this
madhouse!</p><p>(laughter) Good! 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-4>Osho's books on

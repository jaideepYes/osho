The moment this quest is fulfilled an explosion happens; just like atomic explosion. Many new qualities which had never existed before start blossoming in you. They were potentially there but not actual.\nMeditation transforms the potential into the actual, makes the invisible visible, makes the dream a reality.\nAnd Milly symbolises two very essential qualities that come out of that inner\nexplosion. The word\n'milly' can be derived from two languages; the first language is Teutonic and the second is Latin. From the Teutonic root milly means gentle power. That's a very significant point.\nOrdinarily power is never gentle, power is violent, aggressive, destructive, but power becomes gentle by passing through meditation. This is the alchemical change that comes into one's being. Even the destructive forces become creative. The thorns are no more thorns, they become flowers, they become fragrant.\nWhen power is gentle it has a beauty; then it is nothing but the power of love. In other words it is no more power, it is simply gentleness. It is in this context that Jesus' statement can be rightly understood: Blessed are the meek for theirs is the kingdom of god.\nOn one hand they are meek, gentle, humble, nobodies; on the other hand they become emperors, they have the infinite power of the kingdom of god. The statement is paradoxical but very representative of truth.\nThe second meaning comes from a Latin root and that is even more beautiful. but it cannot happen before the first. The second meaning is sweet singer. When your destructive energies are transformed into creativity, when love is your only power, when gentleness is your strength, then your life is a sweet song, then your life is a dance, a celebration. Then each of your gestures and acts has the grace of the beyond.\nThen god starts filtering through you into the world because now you are no more, only god is. But this impossibility becomes possible through the art of meditation.\nOne has to close one's eyes to the outside world at least for a few hours every day and focus within. In the beginning there is nothing but darkness. In the beginning you meet thoughts, desires, memories and dreams -- nothing else. It is all rubbish; one gets fed up and one wants to go out. But if one has perseverance and patience, then one day just through going on and on looking within all these clouds disappear. Slowly slowly the night disappears into a dawn. And the moment the darkness is no more and light has arrived, then the miracle, then the transformation of power into gentleness happens. And that gentleness becomes a sweet song.\nThis exactly defines sannyas gentle power and a sweet song.\n(Continuing on the theme of the alchemical action of meditation, Osho turns to Dhyano Melville.) Gautam the Buddha has defined meditation as the miracle that transforms all your passions into compassion, that brings a radical change in your life energies. Hatred becomes love, greed becomes sharing, the effort to dominate others becomes service.\nIf one is a servant without meditation then that state is not good, that is ugly; that simply means you have become a slave. You have allowed somebody to possess you, you have allowed somebody to reduce you to a commodity. You have allowed somebody to destroy you, to destroy your very being. It is like committing suicide.\nBut if it happens through meditation then it is not a question of becoming a servant to somebody. You are not allowing somebody to use you as a means for his own ends. You are a servant not because you are forced to be a servant; you are a servant because of your love. It's orientation is within you; it is not imposed from the outside, it grows in you. It is pure service with no greed, with no fear, with no idea of gaining anything out of it It is simply sharing your love. It is sympathy in the beginning and it is empathy in the end.\nIt is feeling for people's misery and trying to do something for it. But it is just out of your own vision, clarity, love and compassion; you are not regimented in it.\nSo I don't think Christian missionaries are real servants; they are greedy. Of course their greed is for the other world, but greed is greed: whether you desire this world or the other makes no difference. They are longing for heavenly pleasures because this world, pleasures are momentary and that world's pleasures are eternal. So in fact they are more greedy than the worldly people. They are ready to sacrifice their life but it is not pure love, it is pure greed. It is not sharing, it is not compassion for the others; it is just an other-worldly selfishness. And the reason is that the Christian missionary has no idea of meditation. He has been told to serve people because through service he will attain to god, through service he will reach heaven, through service he will be able to avoid the suffering of hell and he will gain all the pleasures that every Christian missionary is entitled to. But there is no meditation behind it.\nA meditator simply serves because he enjoys serving. There is no future in it, no goal and no end. It is 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nnot a means to some end, either this worldly or other-worldly. The act in itself is so joyous, it is so prayerful\n-- who bothers about heaven?\nThe story of Gautam the Buddha is that when after his death he reached the doors of heaven, the doors were opened and the angels celebrated his coming, but he didn't enter. He stood on the door, his back towards heaven, and looked towards the world which he had left far behind.\nThe angels were disturbed. They asked 'What is the matter? For whom are you waiting? Enter! We have never given such a welcome to anybody.' And in the story Buddha is reported to have said 'I will not enter unless every being, every suffering being in the world has entered. I will be the last one. So please keep your doors closed; it is not time for me to enter yet. I am going to be the last person. I will wait for everybody else to enter first, I will help people, I will show them the way, because I love, because I feel immense compassion. Heaven is not for me yet. I can see millions of souls struggling in darkness, in suffering, in pain, and I am in a situation to help them. I am not obliging them, it is just my joy.' But he refused to enter heaven.\nThis story shows the real attitude and the approach of a meditator. When meditation makes you a servant it is a totally different phenomenon -- and that's what my sannyasins have to be.\nThe first and the foremost thing is meditation, then service comes of its own accord; you need not practise it. A practised service is a false thing, it has to come naturally. Just as flowers grow in the trees it has to grow out of your meditativeness, only then is it true, authentic, liberating.\nLOVE: THE FLOWERS ON THE TREE OF LIFE\n(And friendliness is the fragrance of those flowers. Osho tells Anand Damiet that her name comes from a Greek story about two friend, Damon and Pythias.)\nDamon offered his life for his friend Pythias he died for his friend, hence his name has become a symbol for friendship.\nThe miserable person cannot be friendly, it is impossible for him because he has nothing to share.\nHe can beg but he cannot give, and friendship depends on giving. But you can give only that which you already have, so the true friend has to be blissful, only then he can share. Then of course one can even sacrifice one's life, because love is a far higher value than life itself. Life is only an opportunity for love to blossom. If love blossoms life is significant, if love does not blossom life has been a sheer wastage.\nI teach blissfulness because out of blissfulness many things happen; friendship is one of the qualities.\nFriendship is only the beginning, remember. When friendship becomes more purified it becomes friendliness. Friendship is a relationship between two people or a few people, but it has a limitation.\nFriendliness is simply your quality, your fragrance, the aura that surrounds a blissful person; he is simply friendly. He is friendly to the trees, to the rocks, to people, to animals -- he is simply friendly. He is friendly towards himself too. In fact all enmity in him disappears. The energy that is enmity and hatred has been transformed into love, into bliss.\nAnd to be blissful is not as difficult as people think. It looks very difficult because the whole approach is wrong. It is as if you have lost something in the house and you are searching for it on the road, you will not find it. And then it looks difficult or almost impossible to find it, and it is impossible because you have not lost it there; you have to look where you have lost it.\nPeople are looking for bliss in the world and bliss is waiting as your potential at the innermost core of your being. Go in, and the moment you go in you have found it out and the farther you go, the farther away you are from the goal.\nAnd to come to one's self is a simple process. Nobody is competing with you\nthere because nobody else can enter you, only you can enter. So it is a very non- competitive thing. If you want to be a president or a prime minister then millions of people are trying to be the same. Of course, it is a tough struggle and only one is going to be the winner; the most cunning, the most destructive, the most criminal, is going to win the game. The cheat, the deceptive, the fraud -- he is going to win the game.\nBut as far as the inner world is concerned there is no competition at all; that makes it very simple and very easy. And because you are not trying to possess something which belongs to somebody else you are not in any way coming in anybody's way. You can become a Buddha, a Jesus, a Krishna, and you will not have taken anything from anybody. In fact whenever a person becomes a Buddha he enhances the quality of the whole existence; the existence gains through his enlightenment. So the process is simple; we just have to 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nlearn how to turn in, how to close our eyes and how to sit silently doing nothing.\nThis is the most difficult thing for people because they have been told again and again 'Do something, don't just sit there!' And I say to my sannyasins 'Just sit there -- don't go on doing something!' Just sitting and doing nothing is the whole art of meditation. And out of that centredness and groundedness bliss arises and goes on spreading. A single blissful person makes the whole universe radiate with high bliss.\nAnd of courage, he is bound to be friendly, friendly to all unconditionally. TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH...\n(You have to know your own truth first, then you comprehend the ultimate truth. Osho first explains to Satyam Angelika that her name means the ultimate truth, and, a messenger of god.) Everybody is a messenger of god, but nobody is aware of it because nobody is even aware of their own truth.\nGod means the truth of the whole existence. How can you be aware of god if you\nare not even aware of your own truth? The drop is not aware of its own existence and it is trying to be aware of the ocean -- that is impossible. Vice versa is possible: if the drop becomes aware of its own truth then it is aware of the truth of the whole ocean too. If you have totally understood a single drop of water that means you have understood all water, not only on this earth but on all the earths and all the planets, in the whole universe. Wherever water exists its composition is going to be the same: H2O; water cannot exist in any other form. And a single drop of water contains the whole secret, the secret of the oceans.\nBut people are so stupid that they try to believe in god. Rather than looking within their own selves and searching for the truth, they start their journey by a belief in the cosmic, in the universal. That is sheer tomfoolery, it is idiocy; these peoples are Don Quixotes.\nMy approach is simple and scientific. I don't teach you to believe in god because I know: how can you believe in god? -- you don't even know who you are. Who is the believer? That is the first thing to be explored. And if that is understood, root and all, you will understand god too.\nSo first try to discover your own ultimate truth and in that very discovery suddenly you have stumbled upon the truth of the whole -- that's what god is all about. And then you know that you come from god, that everybody comes from god, that all life originates in god. Hence everybody in his own way is a messenger of god.\nTHE TRIP OF THE LIGHT FANTASTIC\n(Her name, Amitabha, means infinite light, Osho tells the last initiate.) Amitabha is one of the names of Gautam the Buddha; he was given this name when he became enlightened.\nEvery person has the potential to be enlightened; just a little work is needed, just a little awareness, just a little silence. And we can manage it! Nobody need miss. If we miss only we are responsible. Just a few right steps -- according to me just two steps are enough -- and the journey is complete.\nThe first step is to become a witness to your mind processes, to the traffic of thoughts, desires, memories, dreams and fantasies. And the second step is to become aware of your own witnessing. And the journey is complete and the darkness is over and the night is finished and the sun has risen. That moment of\nthe rising sun is called amitabha -- the infinite light has exploded.\nGoing All the Way Chapter #30 1/08/07 Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2574","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/going_all_the_way/part29/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/going_all_the_way/>Going All The Way</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>13 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2574 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Going_All_The_Way/part29.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part28>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

through going on and on looking within all these clouds disappear.
Slowly slowly the night disappears into a dawn. And the moment the
darkness is no more and light has arrived, then the miracle, then the
transformation of power into gentleness happens. And that gentleness
becomes a sweet song.</p><p>This exactly defines sannyas gentle power and a sweet song.</p><p>(Continuing on the theme of the alchemical action of meditation, Osho
turns to Dhyano Melville.) Gautam the Buddha has defined meditation as
the miracle that transforms all your passions into compassion, that
brings a radical change in your life energies. Hatred becomes love,
greed becomes sharing, the effort to dominate others becomes
service.</p><p>If one is a servant without meditation then that state is not good,
that is ugly; that simply means you have become a slave. You have
allowed somebody to possess you, you have allowed somebody to reduce you

your very being. It is like committing suicide.</p><p>But if it happens through meditation then it is not a question of
becoming a servant to somebody. You are not allowing somebody to use you
as a means for his own ends. You are a servant not because you are
forced to be a servant; you are a servant because of your love. It's
orientation is within you; it is not imposed from the outside, it grows
in you. It is pure service with no greed, with no fear, with no idea of
gaining anything out of it It is simply sharing your love. It is
sympathy in the beginning and it is empathy in the end.</p><p>It is feeling for people's misery and trying to do something for it.
But it is just out of your own vision, clarity, love and compassion; you
are not regimented in it.</p><p>So I don't think Christian missionaries are real servants; they are
greedy. Of course their greed is for the other world, but greed is
greed: whether you desire this world or the other makes no difference.
They are longing for heavenly pleasures because this world, pleasures
are momentary and that world's pleasures are eternal. So in fact they
are more greedy than the worldly people. They are ready to sacrifice
their life but it is not pure love, it is pure greed. It is not sharing,
it is not compassion for the others; it is just an other-worldly
selfishness. And the reason is that the Christian missionary has no idea
of meditation. He has been told to serve people because through service
he will attain to god, through service he will reach heaven, through
service he will be able to avoid the suffering of hell and he will gain

act in itself is so joyous, it is so prayerful</p><p>-- who bothers about heaven?</p><p>The story of Gautam the Buddha is that when after his death he
reached the doors of heaven, the doors were opened and the angels
celebrated his coming, but he didn't enter. He stood on the door, his
back towards heaven, and looked towards the world which he had left far
behind.</p><p>The angels were disturbed. They asked 'What is the matter? For whom
are you waiting? Enter! We have never given such a welcome to anybody.'
And in the story Buddha is reported to have said 'I will not enter
unless every being, every suffering being in the world has entered. I
will be the last one. So please keep your doors closed; it is not time
for me to enter yet. I am going to be the last person. I will wait for
everybody else to enter first, I will help people, I will show them the
way, because I love, because I feel immense compassion. Heaven is not
for me yet. I can see millions of souls struggling in darkness, in
suffering, in pain, and I am in a situation to help them. I am not
obliging them, it is just my joy.' But he refused to enter heaven.</p><p>This story shows the real attitude and the approach of a meditator.
When meditation makes you a servant it is a totally different phenomenon
-- and that's what my sannyasins have to be.</p><p>The first and the foremost thing is meditation, then service comes of
its own accord; you need not practise it. A practised service is a false
thing, it has to come naturally. Just as flowers grow in the trees it
has to grow out of your meditativeness, only then is it true, authentic,
liberating.</p><p>LOVE: THE FLOWERS ON THE TREE OF LIFE</p><p>(And friendliness is the fragrance of those flowers. Osho tells Anand
Damiet that her name comes from a Greek story about two friend, Damon
and Pythias.)</p><p>Damon offered his life for his friend Pythias he died for his friend,
hence his name has become a symbol for friendship.</p><p>The miserable person cannot be friendly, it is impossible for him
because he has nothing to share.</p><p>He can beg but he cannot give, and friendship depends on giving. But
you can give only that which you already have, so the true friend has to
be blissful, only then he can share. Then of course one can even
sacrifice one's life, because love is a far higher value than life
itself. Life is only an opportunity for love to blossom. If love
blossoms life is significant, if love does not blossom life has been a
sheer wastage.</p><p>I teach blissfulness because out of blissfulness many things happen;
friendship is one of the qualities.</p><p>Friendship is only the beginning, remember. When friendship becomes
more purified it becomes friendliness. Friendship is a relationship
between two people or a few people, but it has a limitation.</p><p>Friendliness is simply your quality, your fragrance, the aura that
surrounds a blissful person; he is simply friendly. He is friendly to
the trees, to the rocks, to people, to animals -- he is simply friendly.
He is friendly towards himself too. In fact all enmity in him
disappears. The energy that is enmity and hatred has been transformed
into love, into bliss.</p><p>And to be blissful is not as difficult as people think. It looks very
difficult because the whole approach is wrong. It is as if you have lost
something in the house and you are searching for it on the road, you
will not find it. And then it looks difficult or almost impossible to
find it, and it <em>is</em> impossible because you have not lost it
there; you have to look where you have lost it.</p><p>People are looking for bliss in the world and bliss is waiting as
your potential at the innermost core of your being. Go in, and the
moment you go in you have found it out and the farther you go, the
farther away you are from the goal.</p><p>And to come to one's self is a simple process. Nobody is competing
with you</p><p>there because nobody else can enter you, only you can enter. So it is
a very non- competitive thing. If you want to be a president or a prime
minister then millions of people are trying to be the same. Of course,
it is a tough struggle and only one is going to be the winner; the most
cunning, the most destructive, the most criminal, is going to win the
game. The cheat, the deceptive, the fraud -- he is going to win the
game.</p><p>But as far as the inner world is concerned there is no competition at
all; that makes it very simple and very easy. And because you are not
trying to possess something which belongs to somebody else you are not
in any way coming in anybody's way. You can become a Buddha, a Jesus, a
Krishna, and you will not have taken anything from anybody. In fact
whenever a person becomes a Buddha he enhances the quality of the whole
existence; the existence gains through his enlightenment. So the process
is simple; we just have to 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>learn how to turn in, how to close our eyes and how to sit silently
doing nothing.</p><p>This is the most difficult thing for people because they have been
told again and again 'Do something, don't just sit there!' And I say to
my sannyasins 'Just sit there -- don't go on doing something!' Just
sitting and doing nothing is the whole art of meditation. And out of
that centredness and groundedness bliss arises and goes on spreading. A
single blissful person makes the whole universe radiate with high
bliss.</p><p>And of courage, he is bound to be friendly, friendly to all
unconditionally. TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH...</p><p>(You have to know your own truth first, then you comprehend the
ultimate truth. Osho first explains to Satyam Angelika that her name
means the ultimate truth, and, a messenger of god.) Everybody is a
messenger of god, but nobody is aware of it because nobody is even aware
of their own truth.</p><p>God means the truth of the whole existence. How can you be aware of
god if you</p><p>are not even aware of your own truth? The drop is not aware of its
own existence and it is trying to be aware of the ocean -- that is
impossible. Vice versa is possible: if the drop becomes aware of its own
truth then it is aware of the truth of the whole ocean too. If you have
totally understood a single drop of water that means you have understood
all water, not only on this earth but on all the earths and all the
planets, in the whole universe. Wherever water exists its composition is
going to be the same: H2O; water cannot exist in any other form. And a
single drop of water contains the whole secret, the secret of the
oceans.</p><p>But people are so stupid that they try to believe in god. Rather than
looking within their own selves and searching for the truth, they start
their journey by a belief in the cosmic, in the universal. That is sheer
tomfoolery, it is idiocy; these peoples are Don Quixotes.</p><p>My approach is simple and scientific. I don't teach you to believe in
god because I know: how can you believe in god? -- you don't even know
who you are. Who is the believer? That is the first thing to be
explored. And if that is understood, root and all, you will understand
god too.</p><p>So first try to discover your own ultimate truth and in that very
discovery suddenly you have stumbled upon the truth of the whole --
that's what god is all about. And then you know that you come from god,
that everybody comes from god, that all life originates in god. Hence
everybody in his own way is a messenger of god.</p><p>THE TRIP OF THE LIGHT FANTASTIC</p><p>(Her name, Amitabha, means infinite light, Osho tells the last
initiate.) Amitabha is one of the names of Gautam the Buddha; he was
given this name when he became enlightened.</p><p>Every person has the potential to be enlightened; just a little work
is needed, just a little awareness, just a little silence. And we can
manage it! Nobody need miss. If we miss only we are responsible. Just a
few right steps -- according to me just two steps are enough -- and the
journey is complete.</p><p>The first step is to become a witness to your mind processes, to the
traffic of thoughts, desires, memories, dreams and fantasies. And the
second step is to become aware of your own witnessing. And the journey
is complete and the darkness is over and the night is finished and the
sun has risen. That moment of</p><p>the rising sun is called amitabha -- the infinite light has
exploded.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;line-height:192%;text-align:left id=going-all-the-way-chapter-30-10807>Going All the Way <span class=p>Chapter #30 1/08/07</span></h3><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on

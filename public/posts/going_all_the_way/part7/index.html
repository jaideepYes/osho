The miracle of the cloud is that while it continuously changes, essentially it remains itself.)\nA sannyasin has to becomes outwardly free, unconfined by any tradition, nation, caste, religion and inwardly capable of constant flow. The centre remains the same but the wheel of life goes on changing.\nI am not against change -- change is life -- but the person who knows only change does not know life in its totality; he has come to know only the\ncircumference of it. The wheel changes but the axel remains unchanging. And they both are together, so your actions will change, your body will change, your mind will change, your feelings will change. Amidst all this change you have to be a witness. That witness will not change, that will remain the same.\nThis brings inward freedom, and when one is free in both ways, outwardly and inwardly, one has tasted of god, one becomes drunk with the divine.\nTHE CROWN OF CONSCIOUSNESS\nAlok Sara means light and god's princess.\nMan is unaware of his own kingdom. The kingdom is there but we are keeping our back towards it. We are looking everywhere, searching, desiring, begging; and what we are begging for is already inside of everybody. We are beggars because we have not looked in, and we are in darkness inside because wherever consciousness is not, there is darkness. The moment we turn our consciousness inwards it becomes light --\nconsciousness is light. And to see what God has given to us is unbelievable. When it happens for the first time one cannot believe one's own eyes. One looks again and again and again.\nIn the Zen tradition it is said that before the final enlightenment at least one thousand small enlightenments happen; those small enlightenments are because you look again and you cannot believe, you look again and you cannot believe. Slowly slowly you gather courage to believe that you have seen it, that you are not a beggar but an emperor.\nSo these things are joined together. We have to turn our light in and discover our reality. In short that's what sannyas is all about. It is not a religion in the ordinary sense because I don't teach any doctrine; it is an experience -- existential, not intellectual. I only help you to discover that which you have already got.\nMAN IS A MAYBE\n(He hovers between the finite and the infinite, Osho tells Swami Amiten.) He lives in a material body but he is absolutely non material. He is pure consciousness. He lives in the mind but he is not the mind at all. So man contains two worlds, man is a meeting place of two extremes.\nMan is a bridge between god and the world, between the finite and the infinite, between time and eternity.\nUnless we discover the infinite in ourselves our life remains meaningless. The finite cannot give us meaning; it is too small, too momentary, too fleeting. It is just like a dream, it cannot give you a solid foundation. To make your house on the shifting sands of the momentary, of the temporary, is an exercise in sheer futility. The very recognition of this becomes the beginning of a search for the eternal.\nSannyas, initiation into sannyas, simply means a turning point in your life, a drastic change, shifting 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nyour consciousness from the limited to the unlimited.\nIt is as if a man is walking, looking at the earth, and has completely forgotten the sky and all its stars.\nAnd then you help him to look upwards and he is mystified, he thinks a miracle has happened. But the sky was always there, it was just that he was not looking at it; he had become too concerned with the non-essential. And both are in us, the earth part and the sky part.\nNow it is our choice as to where to look. So from this moment start looking more and more for the unbounded and you will be on the right track towards god. He is not in the churches, not in the temples, not in the scriptures, not in the systems of philosophy and theology. They are all limited. He is in a profound silence, where you are not a body, not a mind, not even a heart, where you simply are. In that simple pure existence, truth is found, god is found, liberation is found.\n(Osho leads up to the same truth -- man's immortality -- from a different vantage point.) The past of the whole of humanity has been dominated by defeatist attitudes. All the religions arose out of despair.\nMy vision is just the opposite of that. My sannyasins are not sannyasins out of any pessimism. They are not escapists, they are not defeatists, they are adventurers, explorers. Initiation into sannyas is the beginning of a journey, a journey towards the ultimate. It is the only journey that can make you really victorious.\nMoney cannot do it, power cannot do it, prestige cannot do it, because they will all be taken away at the time of death. So you never really possess them; you lived under an illusion that you were the possessor.\nThe criterion to judge what you possess and what you don't, is simple: that which cannot be taken away by death is your possession, that which is going to be taken away is only an illusion. So whatsoever we can gain in the outside world is not of any importance. One has to become inwardly rich, one has to conquer oneself; one has to become centred at the very core of one's being.\nOut of that groundedness, out of that rootedness, great tree grows, a tree that brings the flowers of victory.\nThe moment you know something in you which is eternal, know that you have come home, that you have found that for which you have been searching for ages, that you have found life abundant. God is only another name for it.\nMEDITATION IS WHITE MAGIC\nMan can live in constant conflict or in constant music. It is the game energy that become conflict or that becomes music. The whole thing is to learn the art of creating harmony within your being -- and the whole conditioning of humanity is to create conflict. They tell you not to be angry but they never tell you how.\nThey insist that it is bad to be angry but nobody ever tells you the science of not being angry. So the only thing left for you is to repress anger, not to show it. It will be there and it goes on accumulating.\nThat's how one creates conflict, one becomes double: anger is there and one is smiling, sex is there and one is taking a vow of celibacy, desire is there and one is renouncing the world, greed is there but one is pretending non-greediness, violence is there and one has cultivated a mask of non-violence, hate is there and one is trying to project love. So in a thousand ways one becomes divided and there is constant conflict, inner war, civil war. Everybody is sitting on a volcano,\nit can erupt any moment. One insane any time.\nThe society has taken every care to drive you insane. It is really a miracle how people somehow manage to keep themselves together.\nLife can be music and should be music because only then do you know what life is. But then repression won't help. You will have to learn something of the inner alchemy, of how anger is transformed into compassion, how hate is transformed into love with no residue so there is no conflict left, how violence becomes non- violence and how living in the world one can yet be not of it.\nThis is what I call the whole science of sannyas, the whole inner alchemy, It is the greatest science in the world because it transforms man, and nothing is more valuable than man. Even if we could transform iron into gold that would be nothing; if we can transform our ugly instincts into beautiful flowers that is real magic. And it is not difficult either. Just a simple phenomenon has to be learned -\n- I call it meditation.\nIt has been called by different names. Buddha used to call it sammasati, right mindfulness. George Gurdjieff used to call it self-remembering, Krishnamurti calls it awareness. It is the same. The whole thing is how to become a witness.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nWhen you are angry there is no need to fight with it -- it is a great opportunity to watch. No need to indulge in it no need to act according to it, no need to follow its dictates, and no need either to go to the opposite extreme and start fighting with it. Avoid both. Just remain cool, detached, a simple observer, as if it has nothing to do with you. Your concern should be scientific, you are observing, so you have to look minutely at what anger is in all its details, in its whole mystery. Your interest has to be scientific; 'I have to go deeper into the whole method of it. If I follow it I will not be able to go into it. I will become angry.' In that hot state how can you watch? 'If I fight with it again, it will be the same: I will be running away, repressing, avoiding.' How can you watch something of which\nyou are afraid?\nNo need to be afraid, no need to follow -- just sit silently and watch and a miracle starts happening slowly: the more you watch, the more you see that it is dispersing on its own. Just as dewdrops evaporate in the morning sun, as your awareness becomes more intense it starts evaporating faster. And the same is the process for sexuality, for greed, for jealousy, for all the problems -- the key is one, it is a master key. Try it on one and then you will know that it can be tried on everything.\nA day arrives when you have understood all your baser instincts and in that very understanding they are transformed, transmuted, and your life becomes a melody. I call that melody sannyas. That musical phenomenon, that harmony, that beautiful silence, that song of silence, is the greatest achievement in life.\nPRAYER IS PARTICIPATION IN THE CREATION\n(Osho returns to a theme he has been touching on frequently this month -- man's relationship to existence.)\nExistence loves us all. We are here, that is enough proof, otherwise we would not have been here at all; we have been chosen to be by existence. It is not our choice, we have not created ourselves; it is the decision on the part of the whole. And existence goes on nourishing us every moment on all the planes --\nphysical, psychological, spiritual. But our stupidity is such that we start taking all these things for granted as if we have earned them, as if we deserve them, as if life is our birthright. We forget completely that it is a gift of god.\nA sannyasin has to remember not to take anything for granted. That is one of the most foolish things a person can do with existence, that is very ungrateful, insensitive. A sannyasin has to continuously remember that existence goes on pouring so many gifts and you have not even thanked it and you have not contributed anything on your part.\nThe only way to show our gratitude is not by going into the churches and falling on our knees and reciting some parrotlike prayers or by going into a temple and chanting some words which you don't understand. You don't mean anything, just a formality is being fulfilled.\nThe real gratitude is expressed only through creativity. When you start creating something to enhance, to enrich existence -- it may be just a small garden or anything, a painting, a song, a dance... when you start being creative you are showing gratitude. In your own small way you are participating with god.\nThe only thing that a sannyasin has to do is not to leave the world in the same ugly shape as he found it\n-- to make just a little change. One cannot hope to change the whole world -- it is too big and our hands are too small -- but still we can do something. There can be a few more flowers in the world, a few bigger roses in the world, a few more smiling faces in the world, a few more dancers, a few more singers, a few more paintings, And if we have done something out of gratitude t brings tremendous joy.\nCreativity is the only way of real prayer. IT'S NIRVANA OR NEVER\nMan lives like a robot, almost like a machine. He goes through so many actions but mechanically. He may go for a morning walk but he will not listen to the birds, he will not see the trees, he will not look at the sunrise, he will not be aware of the beautiful colours that are changing in the sky -- and still he has been for a morning walk. He will go and come home. In fact he went just like a machine, a proxy, not himself. He may have been somewhere else, the whole time he was on his morning walk. He may have been preparing for the night, for the dinner that he was going to attend, the party or the movie or the girlfriend that he was going to see -- all kinds of fantasies and dreams were there. He was not there, he was somewhere else.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nIt is very rare to find a man at the exact point where he is physically; you can find him somewhere else but not where he is. There is such a disparity. No one is\nhere, no one is now -- and here and now is the only life, the only reality.\nThe sannyasin has to learn the knack of being here, and now because nirvana is either now or never.\nEnlightenment happens now or never, either it happens here or nowhere else... because existence knows nothing about the past or the future. Its only way of being is the present. The present is the only time, now is the only time, and here the only space.\nSo we have to bring ourselves now and here. The mind will go on clinging to its old habits, it is very persistent, but you have to pull it back again and again. Whenever you see it going astray you have to bring it back to this moment.\nThe whole question is how to get out of the old habits. It takes perseverance, effort and the trust that if it has happened to somebody else then it can happen to me too.\nEverybody is potentially a Buddha. Bodhen is the process of becoming a Buddha, awakening is the process of becoming awakened. The seed is there, but we have to work to bring it to a point where it can blossom. And it is always spring, so the opportunity it always available. Something is only missing on our part.\nSo you have to do this: learn... There are hundreds of devices available here to become aware and alert, watchful. Learn all those devices and find the right device that suddenly starts ringing bells in your heart. It always happens and that's the only way to choose. It is not a question of logic, that you decide that this device will fit with you. When you come across the right device your heart starts pulsating in a new way, it dances. Listen to the heart and follow the heart.\nGoing All the Way Chapter #8\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2787","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/going_all_the_way/part7/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/going_all_the_way/>Going All The Way</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>14 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2787 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Going_All_The_Way/part7.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part6>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

track towards god. He is not in the churches, not in the temples, not in
the scriptures, not in the systems of philosophy and theology. They are
all limited. He is in a profound silence, where you are not a body, not
a mind, not even a heart, where you simply are. In that simple pure
existence, truth is found, god is found, liberation is found.</p><p>(Osho leads up to the same truth -- man's immortality -- from a
different vantage point.) The past of the whole of humanity has been
dominated by defeatist attitudes. All the religions arose out of
despair.</p><p>My vision is just the opposite of that. My sannyasins are not
sannyasins out of any pessimism. They are not escapists, they are not
defeatists, they are adventurers, explorers. Initiation into sannyas is
the beginning of a journey, a journey towards the ultimate. It is the
only journey that can make you really victorious.</p><p>Money cannot do it, power cannot do it, prestige cannot do it,
because they will all be taken away at the time of death. So you never
really possess them; you lived under an illusion that you were the
possessor.</p><p>The criterion to judge what you possess and what you don't, is
simple: that which cannot be taken away by death is your possession,
that which is going to be taken away is only an illusion. So whatsoever
we can gain in the outside world is not of any importance. One has to
become inwardly rich, one has to conquer oneself; one has to become
centred at the very core of one's being.</p><p>Out of that groundedness, out of that rootedness, great tree grows, a
tree that brings the flowers of victory.</p><p>The moment you know something in you which is eternal, know that you
have come home, that you have found that for which you have been
searching for ages, that you have found life abundant. God is only
another name for it.</p><p>MEDITATION IS WHITE MAGIC</p><p>Man can live in constant conflict or in constant music. It is the
game energy that become conflict or that becomes music. The whole thing
is to learn the art of creating harmony within your being -- and the
whole conditioning of humanity is to create conflict. They tell you not
to be angry but they never tell you how.</p><p>They insist that it is bad to be angry but nobody ever tells you the
science of not being angry. So the only thing left for you is to repress
anger, not to show it. It will be there and it goes on accumulating.</p><p>That's how one creates conflict, one becomes double: anger is there
and one is smiling, sex is there and one is taking a vow of celibacy,
desire is there and one is renouncing the world, greed is there but one
is pretending non-greediness, violence is there and one has cultivated a
mask of non-violence, hate is there and one is trying to project love.
So in a thousand ways one becomes divided and there is constant
conflict, inner war, civil war. Everybody is sitting on a volcano,</p><p>it can erupt any moment. One insane any time.</p><p>The society has taken every care to drive you insane. It is really a
miracle how people somehow manage to keep themselves together.</p><p>Life can be music and should be music because only then do you know
what life is. But then repression won't help. You will have to learn
something of the inner alchemy, of how anger is transformed into
compassion, how hate is transformed into love with no residue so there
is no conflict left, how violence becomes non- violence and how living
in the world one can yet be not of it.</p><p>This is what I call the whole science of sannyas, the whole inner
alchemy, It is the greatest science in the world because it transforms
man, and nothing is more valuable than man. Even if we could transform
iron into gold that would be nothing; if we can transform our ugly
instincts into beautiful flowers that is real magic. And it is not
difficult either. Just a simple phenomenon has to be learned -</p><p>- I call it meditation.</p><p>It has been called by different names. Buddha used to call it
sammasati, right mindfulness. George Gurdjieff used to call it
self-remembering, Krishnamurti calls it awareness. It is the same. The
whole thing is how to become a witness.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>When you are angry there is no need to fight with it -- it is a great
opportunity to watch. No need to indulge in it no need to act according
to it, no need to follow its dictates, and no need either to go to the
opposite extreme and start fighting with it. Avoid both. Just remain
cool, detached, a simple observer, as if it has nothing to do with you.
Your concern should be scientific, you are observing, so you have to
look minutely at what anger is in all its details, in its whole mystery.
Your interest has to be scientific; 'I have to go deeper into the whole
method of it. If I follow it I will not be able to go into it. I will
become angry.' In that hot state how can you watch? 'If I fight with it
again, it will be the same: I will be running away, repressing,
avoiding.' How can you watch something of which</p><p>you are afraid?</p><p>No need to be afraid, no need to follow -- just sit silently and
watch and a miracle starts happening slowly: the more you watch, the
more you see that it is dispersing on its own. Just as dewdrops
evaporate in the morning sun, as your awareness becomes more intense it
starts evaporating faster. And the same is the process for sexuality,
for greed, for jealousy, for all the problems -- the key is one, it is a
master key. Try it on one and then you will know that it can be tried on
everything.</p><p>A day arrives when you have understood all your baser instincts and
in that very understanding they are transformed, transmuted, and your
life becomes a melody. I call that melody sannyas. That musical
phenomenon, that harmony, that beautiful silence, that song of silence,
is the greatest achievement in life.</p><p>PRAYER IS PARTICIPATION IN THE CREATION</p><p>(Osho returns to a theme he has been touching on frequently this
month -- man's relationship to existence.)</p><p>Existence loves us all. We are here, that is enough proof, otherwise
we would not have been here at all; we have been chosen to be by
existence. It is not our choice, we have not created ourselves; it is
the decision on the part of the whole. And existence goes on nourishing
us every moment on all the planes --</p><p>physical, psychological, spiritual. But our stupidity is such that we
start taking all these things for granted as if we have earned them, as
if we deserve them, as if life is our birthright. We forget completely
that it is a gift of god.</p><p>A sannyasin has to remember not to take anything for granted. That is
one of the most foolish things a person can do with existence, that is
very ungrateful, insensitive. A sannyasin has to continuously remember
that existence goes on pouring so many gifts and you have not even
thanked it and you have not contributed anything on your part.</p><p>The only way to show our gratitude is not by going into the churches
and falling on our knees and reciting some parrotlike prayers or by
going into a temple and chanting some words which you don't understand.
You don't mean anything, just a formality is being fulfilled.</p><p>The real gratitude is expressed only through creativity. When you
start creating something to enhance, to enrich existence -- it may be
just a small garden or anything, a painting, a song, a dance... when you
start being creative you are showing gratitude. In your own small way
you are participating with god.</p><p>The only thing that a sannyasin has to do is not to leave the world
in the same ugly shape as he found it</p><p>-- to make just a little change. One cannot hope to change the whole
world -- it is too big and our hands are too small -- but still we can
do something. There can be a few more flowers in the world, a few bigger
roses in the world, a few more smiling faces in the world, a few more
dancers, a few more singers, a few more paintings, And if we have done
something out of gratitude t brings tremendous joy.</p><p>Creativity is the only way of real prayer. IT'S NIRVANA OR NEVER</p><p>Man lives like a robot, almost like a machine. He goes through so
many actions but mechanically. He may go for a morning walk but he will
not listen to the birds, he will not see the trees, he will not look at
the sunrise, he will not be aware of the beautiful colours that are
changing in the sky -- and still he has been for a morning walk. He will
go and come home. In fact he went just like a machine, a proxy, not
himself. He may have been somewhere else, the whole time he was on his
morning walk. He may have been preparing for the night, for the dinner
that he was going to attend, the party or the movie or the girlfriend
that he was going to see -- all kinds of fantasies and dreams were
there. He was not there, he was somewhere else.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>It is very rare to find a man at the exact point where he is
physically; you can find him somewhere else but not where he is. There
is such a disparity. No one is</p><p>here, no one is now -- and here and now is the only life, the only
reality.</p><p>The sannyasin has to learn the knack of being here, and now because
nirvana is either now or never.</p><p>Enlightenment happens now or never, either it happens here or nowhere
else... because existence knows nothing about the past or the future.
Its only way of being is the present. The present is the only time, now
is the only time, and here the only space.</p><p>So we have to bring ourselves now and here. The mind will go on
clinging to its old habits, it is very persistent, but you have to pull
it back again and again. Whenever you see it going astray you have to
bring it back to this moment.</p><p>The whole question is how to get out of the old habits. It takes
perseverance, effort and the trust that if it has happened to somebody
else then it can happen to me too.</p><p>Everybody is potentially a Buddha. Bodhen is the process of becoming
a Buddha, awakening is the process of becoming awakened. The seed is
there, but we have to work to bring it to a point where it can blossom.
And it is always spring, so the opportunity it always available.
Something is only missing on our part.</p><p>So you have to do this: learn... There are hundreds of devices
available here to become aware and alert, watchful. Learn all those
devices and find the right device that suddenly starts ringing bells in
your heart. It always happens and that's the only way to choose. It is
not a question of logic, that you decide that this device will fit with
you. When you come across the right device your heart starts pulsating
in a new way, it dances. Listen to the heart and follow the heart.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=going-all-the-way>Going All the Way</h3><p>Chapter #8</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part6>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

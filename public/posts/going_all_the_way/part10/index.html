It is for reference purposes only.]\nLOVE'S HUE\n(It colors all you see when you take a heart's-eye-view of life) Man can relate with existence either through the head or through the heart. Relating through the head is logical, mathematical, scientific; relating through the heart is illogical, poetic, mystical. But when you relate through the head your relationship remains only superficial, you only touch the periphery of things, never the heart of the matter; hence science will always remain peripheral. Logic will touch things but only the outermost part.\nIt is just as if one touches the waves of the ocean and thinks one has known the ocean. To know the ocean one has to dive deep into it; to really know the ocean one has to become one with it. Only in that union or communion is truth revealed. It is not possible through the head. The heart is the door for that miracle.\nLove represents the heart, and the moment you start relating with existence through the heart existence starts taking on a totally new color. It starts becoming more and more immaterial, spiritual, divine.\nThe people who think logically have always come to the conclusion that there is no god. Their logic is not at fault, their choice is faulty: they have chosen the wrong method. It is beyond the scope of their method to comprehend god. God is known only by the illogical, in a way, the mad people -- the poets, the painters, the sculptors, the dancers. And ultimately, god in its totality is known only to the mystic -- because the poet, the painter, the sculptor, they are somewhere in between. They are not in the head -- that much is certain -- but they are not exactly attuned with the heart either. In those moments poetry arises, but those moments come and go. The poet only has glimpses of god, the mystic abides in that experience. He never falls from it. There is nowhere to fall; wherever he is there is god.\nThat is the meaning of your name, let it also become the meaning of your life, only then is sannyas realized. This is the beginning of a tremendously significant pilgrimage, but only the beginning, just a seed.\nBut it has the potential of ultimate bliss, of ultimate truth, of ultimate freedom. THE GOLDEN RULE: SELF-RULE\nOne can rule others but then it is never noble; it cannot be, by its very nature. At the most it can pretend to be noble but it cannot be. The very idea of ruling another person is ignoble, it is ugly, it is inhuman; it is 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nimmoral because the other is not a means for you, the other is an end unto himself.\nTo rule the other means to reduce him to a commodity, to a thing. To rule the other means to use the other as a means for your purpose.\nEmmanuel Kant, one of the most significant moral thinkers of the West, has come very close to defining the ultimate criterion of morality. He says to use the other as a means is the basic immoral act. Everything else that is immoral is immoral because of this, so this should be the criterion: are you using the other\nas a means?\nEven if the husband uses the wife as a means to fulfil his sexual desire, just as a means, then it is immoral. Then there is no difference between a wife and a prostitute. Maybe the wife is a permanent the of prostitute -- you have a longer lease. If the wife is using the husband in any way -- to possess money, to possess power -- then again she is reducing the man to a servant. And to reduce the other in any way from his uniqueness, from his being an end unto himself or herself, cannot be noble. So the only noble rule possible is the rule over oneself.\nAlexander the Great is not noble, only Gautam the Buddha is noble, for the simple reason that Buddha has no rule over others but he is a master of himself. There is no part of his being which is not in tune with him. He has come to attain absolute harmony. There is no conflict in him, there is a reign of absolute peace.\nAnd his consciousness is supreme, nothing is above it -- no instinct, no intellect, nothing is higher than his consciousness.\nAtmo means that consciousness, the soul. And when your soul is supreme in your existence and is not ruled by anything -- by your sexuality, by your greed, by your anger, by your violence, by all kinds of unconscious instincts -- then you have attained real mastery. And that is the purpose of sannyas.\nGOD -- THE LURE IN EACH LONGING\nWe love many things but essentially in all our love we are searching for god. Of course the search is unconscious, that's why you cannot give any explanation if it is asked 'Why do you love a rose flower?' At the most you can say because it is beautiful, but that is not an answer, it is a tautology. Again the same question can be raised, 'Why do you love that which is beautiful?', and you will be at a loss to answer.\nYou love a beautiful sunset, you love a beautiful woman, you love a beautiful child, you love a beautiful painting -- you love thousands of things. There must be something running through all of them which makes you love them all. You call it beauty but nobody has ever been able to define what beauty is.\nThree thousand years of philosophizing on the subject has not led to any conclusion. The reason why we cannot define beauty is that beauty is really nothing but the reflection of god. And because god itself is indefinable, likewise\nits reflection is indefinable. If you cannot define the moon, how can you define the moon reflected in the lake?\nThe eastern mystics have given three indications of god. They are just hints, not definitions: satyam, shivam, sundaram.\nSatyam means the truth: wherever you find truth it is a reflection of god. Shivam means the good: wherever you find something good it is a reflection of god. And sundaram means the beautiful, the presence of beauty: wherever you find beauty it is the reflection of god.\nThis is the true trinity. And sundaram, the beautiful, is the highest peak. So whatsoever you love -- truth, good, beauty -- it is all in fact an unconscious search for god. Through sannyas the unconscious search has to be made a deliberate, conscious effort.\nThe moment your search becomes conscious it becomes very easy to find the truth. In unconsciousness we go on in circles, in consciousness we can immediately see the centre of the whole thing and we can move to the centre like an arrow.\nMeditation helps you to become aware of whatsoever you have been doing. It takes you out of your vicious circle, it gives you a clear-cut insight into the target. And once you know exactly what your deepest longing is then to find it is very easy. That's why Jesus says, 'Seek and ye shall find, ask and it shall be given unto you, knock and the door shall be opened unto you.' But this seeking, this searching, this knocking, has to be done in absolute consciousness.\nSIMPLY BLISSING DOWN 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\n(We just need to be open to receive.)\nBliss is continuously showering, we are just not ready to receive it. Not even for a single moment does it stop because bliss is the very nature of existence. But to receive it we have to be open, vulnerable, available, welcoming, and we are taught to remain closed. Our windows and doors are all closed; we don't leave even a small hole for the sun to reach us. We are living in graves and we have lived in the graves for so long that now we are afraid to come out into the light. The light seems to be too dazzling, the wind seems to be too rowdy, the rain seems to be dangerous, risky. We have become accustomed to our dark cells and we think this is the only way to live.\nIn fact it is not a way to live at all, it is only a way to commit a gradual suicide. The real way to live is to live with existence, in openness. There is a risk but risking is not bad. Risk is a thrill, it is adventure, it is challenge. It is only through risking that one grows. The more adventurous one is, the more one becomes integrated; the more one goes into insecurity, the more one becomes solid, centered, grounded. And this is the whole process of spiritual evolution.\nBy your becoming a sannyasin all that is expected is that slowly slowly you will stop clinging to your dark cell and its conveniences, its comforts, its consolations, its security, its insurance, and you will start moving a little beyond the boundary of the familiar into the unfamiliar, from the known to the unknown and ultimately from the unknown to the unknowable.\nThese are the two steps: one, from the known to the unknown -- and that is half of the journey -- and the second step, from the unknown to the unknowable -- and that is the second half of the journey. In two steps the whole journey is complete. And the moment you have entered into the unknowable, for the first time you know what life is all about -- its very truth, its very beauty, its very splendor.\nBELIGHTFUL\n(We are, but we've forgotten it.)\nWe are made of light, we come from light and we go to light, and between the two we start dreaming of darkness. Although we dream of darkness we still remain light because there is no other way to be. So it is just a question of dropping our dreams and looking at our reality.\nMeditation simply means putting aside your dreams for a few moments, telling\nyour mind to shut off and for just a few moments remaining in the gap -- no thought, no desire, no mind -- and you will be immediately aware of an immense upsurge of light within you. And you will not see it as separate from yourself, you will see it as your very essence, you will experience it as yourself. That's why the ultimate realisation is called enlightenment: you become the light.\nYou have always been the light, it is just that you have forgotten it. It has to be remembered.\nNOMADS TO NO-MINDS\n(Osho speaks further on man's nature. It is not part of time, although we live in time.) We come from beyond and we have to go beyond again. Time is only a caravanserai, an overnight stay.\nTime exists only between birth and death, but we existed before birth and we will exist after death. We are beginningless and endless.\nThe Upanishads say \"Amritasyaputrah\" -- we are the sons of eternity. This has to be realized, not believed. Belief is of no importance at all. Not only is it of no importance, it is harmful, because it prevents your exploration.\nMy people here are not to believe in anything; but to explore, to search, to enquire, to realize. If it is the truth then there should be no fear in enquiring; if it is not the truth then too there should be no fear in enquiring.\nThe people who are afraid of enquiry are somehow doubtful what they are believing in, hence they don't want to explore. Who knows? -- their belief may not prove true and they have wasted so much in their belief that rather than dropping the belief they are ready to drop the truth.\nBeliefs are man-made, toys to play with -- good for small children but not good for grown-ups. A person 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nis really grown-up when he can get rid of all beliefs -- that's my definition of a grown-up person. If he is ready to drop all the beliefs and become utterly innocent, in a state of not-knowing, from there enquiry begins.\nSo what I am saying is truth to me and I would like it to become truth to you too, but I would not like you to start believing in what I am saying. I am not to be believed. Use me only as a triggering point for further enquiry, as a jumping board, and take the jump into the infinite, into the eternal.\nAnd the only way is meditation because meditation takes you beyond mind. And the moment you are beyond mind you are beyond time too. Time and mind are synonymous. The moment time stops, mind stops, or vice versa is also true: the moment mind stops, time stops.\nAnd the easier way is to stop the mind, it is very easy. Just watch it, and in watching you will find that slowly a few moments start coming when there is nothing to watch, just an emptiness. In that emptiness you will become aware of eternity. First it will come like glimpses and then there will be more stability and then ultimately the explosion that \"I am that\" -- Aham Brahmasmi, I am god, I am the eternal, I am the truth --\nAna'l Haq. When this happens one has come home. Before that we are homeless wanderers in a desert.\nHEART FOR HEART'S SAKE\nIt is not life-negative, it is absolutely life-affirmative. I don't teach renunciation, I am against renunciation; I teach rejoicing. I am not an escapist, hence I don1t say to my sannyasins to escape from the world and to go to the mountains or to the monasteries. I say to them to live in the world and yet not to be of it. And that is something worth doing.\nEscapism is cowardly and the greatest thing, the greatest challenge in life is love: love and yet remain cool, love and yet remain non-possessive, love and yet do not demand -- love just for love's sake! And you will be immensely rewarded, immeasurably enriched, because a person who is capable of loving without asking for anything in return becomes worthy of receiving god.\nIf you ask for something you will get it; but you will not even be aware of what you have missed.\nI have heard a story: a very rich woman was operated on by a great surgeon and the surgeon was hoping that he would be greatly rewarded. He had removed her appendix, and the woman was very happy with the operation; it had been a one- hundred per cent success. But the doctor had not said anything about money because he knew that she was so rich that there would be no problem; whatsoever would be asked she would give.\nAnd when she recovered she came with a very beautiful bag and she said, 'Doctor, I have come with this small present for you.' The bag was beautiful, valuable, but it was not what the doctor was expecting. Just this bag as a present?' He said 'The bag is beautiful and I thank you for it, but this is not enough for my fee. I need at least one thousand dollars.'\nThe woman said 'It is up to you.' She opened the bag, took out one thousand dollars and gave it to the doctor. The doctor looked in the bag; there must have been at least one hundred thousand dollars; she closed the bag and took it away. Now you can think what happened to the doctor -- he must have collapsed!\n(laughter)\nThis is how life is: if you ask something it will be given to you, life is not miserly at all, but the doctor at least was fortunate enough to have a look in the bag and see what he had missed; you will not even be able to look into the bag to see what you have missed.\nOur small minds can only ask for small things. When even god is available we go on asking for tiny things.\nMy suggestion is to love and never to ask for anything -- and you will be surprised: so much comes that it is impossible to believe, because it comes and you had never deserved it, you were not worthy of it.\nOnce you have learned this secret of giving love for love's sake, you have learned the arithmetic of god.\nAnd then life is just pure ecstasy, each moment the ecstasy becomes more and more perfect. It is not that it is perfect in the sense that it was imperfect before, it is not from imperfection to perfection but from perfection to perfection, from one peak of perfection to another peak of perfection which is higher. And it goes on and on and there is no end to it.\nBut one simple secret has to be learned. The name of the secret is love! 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nGoing All the Way Chapter #11\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2966","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/going_all_the_way/part10/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/going_all_the_way/>Going All The Way</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>14 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2966 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Going_All_The_Way/part10.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part9>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

noble. So the only noble rule possible is the rule over oneself.</p><p>Alexander the Great is not noble, only Gautam the Buddha is noble,
for the simple reason that Buddha has no rule over others but he is a
master of himself. There is no part of his being which is not in tune
with him. He has come to attain absolute harmony. There is no conflict
in him, there is a reign of absolute peace.</p><p>And his consciousness is supreme, nothing is above it -- no instinct,
no intellect, nothing is higher than his consciousness.</p><p>Atmo means that consciousness, the soul. And when your soul is
supreme in your existence and is not ruled by anything -- by your
sexuality, by your greed, by your anger, by your violence, by all kinds
of unconscious instincts -- then you have attained real mastery. And
that is the purpose of sannyas.</p><p>GOD -- THE LURE IN EACH LONGING</p><p>We love many things but essentially in all our love we are searching
for god. Of course the search is unconscious, that's why you cannot give
any explanation if it is asked 'Why do you love a rose flower?' At the
most you can say because it is beautiful, but that is not an answer, it
is a tautology. Again the same question can be raised, 'Why do you love
that which is beautiful?', and you will be at a loss to answer.</p><p>You love a beautiful sunset, you love a beautiful woman, you love a
beautiful child, you love a beautiful painting -- you love thousands of
things. There must be something running through all of them which makes
you love them all. You call it beauty but nobody has ever been able to
define what beauty is.</p><p>Three thousand years of philosophizing on the subject has not led to
any conclusion. The reason why we cannot define beauty is that beauty is
really nothing but the reflection of god. And because god itself is
indefinable, likewise</p><p>its reflection is indefinable. If you cannot define the moon, how can
you define the moon reflected in the lake?</p><p>The eastern mystics have given three indications of god. They are
just hints, not definitions: satyam, shivam, sundaram.</p><p>Satyam means the truth: wherever you find truth it is a reflection of
god. Shivam means the good: wherever you find something good it is a
reflection of god. And sundaram means the beautiful, the presence of
beauty: wherever you find beauty it is the reflection of god.</p><p>This is the true trinity. And sundaram, the beautiful, is the highest
peak. So whatsoever you love -- truth, good, beauty -- it is all in fact
an unconscious search for god. Through sannyas the unconscious search
has to be made a deliberate, conscious effort.</p><p>The moment your search becomes conscious it becomes very easy to find
the truth. In unconsciousness we go on in circles, in consciousness we
can immediately see the centre of the whole thing and we can move to the
centre like an arrow.</p><p>Meditation helps you to become aware of whatsoever you have been
doing. It takes you out of your vicious circle, it gives you a clear-cut
insight into the target. And once you know exactly what your deepest
longing is then to find it is very easy. That's why Jesus says, 'Seek
and ye shall find, ask and it shall be given unto you, knock and the
door shall be opened unto you.' But this seeking, this searching, this
knocking, has to be done in absolute consciousness.</p><p>SIMPLY BLISSING DOWN 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>(We just need to be open to receive.)</p><p>Bliss is continuously showering, we are just not ready to receive it.
Not even for a single moment does it stop because bliss is the very
nature of existence. But to receive it we have to be open, vulnerable,
available, welcoming, and we are taught to remain closed. Our windows
and doors are all closed; we don't leave even a small hole for the sun
to reach us. We are living in graves and we have lived in the graves for
so long that now we are afraid to come out into the light. The light
seems to be too dazzling, the wind seems to be too rowdy, the rain seems
to be dangerous, risky. We have become accustomed to our dark cells and
we think this is the only way to live.</p><p>In fact it is not a way to live at all, it is only a way to commit a
gradual suicide. The real way to live is to live with existence, in
openness. There is a risk but risking is not bad. Risk is a thrill, it
is adventure, it is challenge. It is only through risking that one
grows. The more adventurous one is, the more one becomes integrated; the
more one goes into insecurity, the more one becomes solid, centered,
grounded. And this is the whole process of spiritual evolution.</p><p>By your becoming a sannyasin all that is expected is that slowly
slowly you will stop clinging to your dark cell and its conveniences,
its comforts, its consolations, its security, its insurance, and you
will start moving a little beyond the boundary of the familiar into the
unfamiliar, from the known to the unknown and ultimately from the
unknown to the unknowable.</p><p>These are the two steps: one, from the known to the unknown -- and
that is half of the journey -- and the second step, from the unknown to
the unknowable -- and that is the second half of the journey. In two
steps the whole journey is complete. And the moment you have entered
into the unknowable, for the first time you know what life is all about
-- its very truth, its very beauty, its very splendor.</p><p>BELIGHTFUL</p><p>(We are, but we've forgotten it.)</p><p>We are made of light, we come from light and we go to light, and
between the two we start dreaming of darkness. Although we dream of
darkness we still remain light because there is no other way to be. So
it is just a question of dropping our dreams and looking at our
reality.</p><p>Meditation simply means putting aside your dreams for a few moments,
telling</p><p>your mind to shut off and for just a few moments remaining in the gap
-- no thought, no desire, no mind -- and you will be immediately aware
of an immense upsurge of light within you. And you will not see it as
separate from yourself, you will see it as your very essence, you will
experience it as yourself. That's why the ultimate realisation is called
enlightenment: you become the light.</p><p>You have always been the light, it is just that you have forgotten
it. It has to be remembered.</p><p>NOMADS TO NO-MINDS</p><p>(Osho speaks further on man's nature. It is not part of time,
although we live in time.) We come from beyond and we have to go beyond
again. Time is only a caravanserai, an overnight stay.</p><p>Time exists only between birth and death, but we existed before birth
and we will exist after death. We are beginningless and endless.</p><p>The Upanishads say "Amritasyaputrah" -- we are the sons of eternity.
This has to be realized, not believed. Belief is of no importance at
all. Not only is it of no importance, it is harmful, because it prevents
your exploration.</p><p>My people here are not to believe in anything; but to explore, to
search, to enquire, to realize. If it is the truth then there should be
no fear in enquiring; if it is not the truth then too there should be no
fear in enquiring.</p><p>The people who are afraid of enquiry are somehow doubtful what they
are believing in, hence they don't want to explore. Who knows? -- their
belief may not prove true and they have wasted so much in their belief
that rather than dropping the belief they are ready to drop the
truth.</p><p>Beliefs are man-made, toys to play with -- good for small children
but not good for grown-ups. A person 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

definition of a grown-up person. If he is ready to drop all the beliefs
and become utterly innocent, in a state of not-knowing, from there
enquiry begins.</p><p>So what I am saying is truth to me and I would like it to become
truth to you too, but I would not like you to start believing in what I
am saying. I am not to be believed. Use me only as a triggering point
for further enquiry, as a jumping board, and take the jump into the
infinite, into the eternal.</p><p>And the only way is meditation because meditation takes you beyond
mind. And the moment you are beyond mind you are beyond time too. Time
and mind are synonymous. The moment time stops, mind stops, or vice
versa is also true: the moment mind stops, time stops.</p><p>And the easier way is to stop the mind, it is very easy. Just watch
it, and in watching you will find that slowly a few moments start coming
when there is nothing to watch, just an emptiness. In that emptiness you
will become aware of eternity. First it will come like glimpses and then
there will be more stability and then ultimately the explosion that "I
am that" -- Aham Brahmasmi, I am god, I am the eternal, I am the truth
--</p><p>Ana'l Haq. When this happens one has come home. Before that we are
homeless wanderers in a desert.</p><p>HEART FOR HEART'S SAKE</p><p>It is not life-negative, it is absolutely life-affirmative. I don't
teach renunciation, I am against renunciation; I teach rejoicing. I am
not an escapist, hence I don1t say to my sannyasins to escape from the
world and to go to the mountains or to the monasteries. I say to them to
live in the world and yet not to be of it. And that is something worth
doing.</p><p>Escapism is cowardly and the greatest thing, the greatest challenge
in life is love: love and yet remain cool, love and yet remain
non-possessive, love and yet do not demand -- love just for love's sake!
And you will be immensely rewarded, immeasurably enriched, because a
person who is capable of loving without asking for anything in return
becomes worthy of receiving god.</p><p>If you ask for something you will get it; but you will not even be
aware of what you have missed.</p><p>I have heard a story: a very rich woman was operated on by a great
surgeon and the surgeon was hoping that he would be greatly rewarded. He
had removed her appendix, and the woman was very happy with the
operation; it had been a one- hundred per cent success. But the doctor
had not said anything about money because he knew that she was so rich
that there would be no problem; whatsoever would be asked she would
give.</p><p>And when she recovered she came with a very beautiful bag and she
said, 'Doctor, I have come with this small present for you.' The bag was
beautiful, valuable, but it was not what the doctor was expecting. Just
this bag as a present?' He said 'The bag is beautiful and I thank you
for it, but this is not enough for my fee. I need at least one thousand
dollars.'</p><p>The woman said 'It is up to you.' She opened the bag, took out one
thousand dollars and gave it to the doctor. The doctor looked in the
bag; there must have been at least one hundred thousand dollars; she
closed the bag and took it away. Now you can think what happened to the
doctor -- he must have collapsed!</p><p>(laughter)</p><p>This is how life is: if you ask something it will be given to you,
life is not miserly at all, but the doctor at least was fortunate enough
to have a look in the bag and see what he had missed; you will not even
be able to look into the bag to see what you have missed.</p><p>Our small minds can only ask for small things. When even god is
available we go on asking for tiny things.</p><p>My suggestion is to love and never to ask for anything -- and you
will be surprised: so much comes that it is impossible to believe,
because it comes and you had never deserved it, you were not worthy of
it.</p><p>Once you have learned this secret of giving love for love's sake, you
have learned the arithmetic of god.</p><p>And then life is just pure ecstasy, each moment the ecstasy becomes
more and more perfect. It is not that it is perfect in the sense that it
was imperfect before, it is not from imperfection to perfection but from
perfection to perfection, from one peak of perfection to another peak of
perfection which is higher. And it goes on and on and there is no end to
it.</p><p>But one simple secret has to be learned. The name of the secret is
love! 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on

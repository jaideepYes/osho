It is for reference purposes only.]\nRELIGIOUSNESS IS WAKEFULNESS\n(Osho talks about his vision of true conversion to Swami Parivarto.) A man can become a Christian from being a Hindu but that is not conversion. He only changes his thoughts, he remains the same; there is no inner change in his consciousness.\nAs a Hindu he was worshipping Krishna, as a Christian he will worship Christ, but the worshipper is the same; only the idols have been changed. From one prison he has moved to another prison; he is not free yet.\nBy conversion I mean a transformation of consciousness -- not of the mind, not of thoughts, but of awareness. When a man becomes absolutely aware within himself he has gone through a radical change.\nThat's the meaning of Parivarto -- and that's the definition of sannyas.\nI don't give you a new ideology I don't give you a new religion. I simply help you to move from unconsciousness towards consciousness from a state of sleep towards a state of awakening. Except for the awakened person nobody is\nreligious.\n(Osho speaks on the difference between knowledge and wisdom to Ma Sanmati -\n- her name means right knowing. The question is not of knowing more or less but of going asleep or awake Osho reiterates.) For thousands of years the stupid religious people have been arguing about whether Buddha knows more or Jesus whether Krishna knows more or Buddha, whether Buddha knows more or Lao Tzu. There are all fools, blind people arguing about light. They can go on arguing for eternity and they will not come to any conclusion because light has to be seen, not argued about. There is no question of more or less; all the awakened people are the same. They have come to the same silence, the same profound peace. It is not a question of quantity, so you cannot have more or less. It is not the dimension of quantity at all; it is a qualitative revolution. One is simply awakened, not more or less. That is Sanmati -- true awakening, true understanding, true knowing, true wisdom, true awareness. All these meaning are involved in that simple word, 'sanmati'. It contains the whole of all the religions, the secret.\nAvoid information and insist on transformation. MENTAL-GO-ROUND\nWe live in a kind of restlessness. Mind consists of restlessness and nothing else. It knows no rest; day in, day out, it goes on spinning and weaving thoughts, dreams and fantasies. From the cradle to the grave it is continuously working; it cannot exist without this constant occupation. It is like peddling a bicycle, if you go on peddling it,,it keeps moving; the moment you stop peddling it, it falls over. Its whole support is in constant movement. And that's exactly the case with the mind.\nTo be in absolute rest means to get out of this constant peddling. Stop co- operating with the mind and its occupations, because it is your energy that keeps it going on.\nMeditation means withdrawing your energy from the mind. The moment your energy is withdrawn the 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nmind flops. And the collapse of the mind is the beginning of a new life. Then you live in a relaxed way, then there is great silence in you. And out of that silence whatsoever you do is right, out of that rest your actions become beautiful. They carry something of your inner peace, they vibrate with your inner music. Your actions, your words, your gestures, even your silences are full, overflowing with your new being.\nMeditation means rest, absolute rest. If mind is occupation meditation is rest. If mind is a constant chasing after goals then meditation is dropping all chasing and all goals. In that stillness you become capable of miracles -- and everyone is entitled to those miracles. But mind is impotent.\nBeware of the mind and get out of it. Getting out of it is entering your own innermost core -- and that is the only temple I know of where god lives.\nBE A SPIRITUAL SWINGER\n(... be a non-clinger. Osho is talking to Ma Viraga, a German sannyasin.) Love can have two kinds of expressions. It can move in two directions, one is that of attachment, possessiveness, clinging, and the other is of non-attachment, non- possessiveness, non-clinging.\nThe first direction destroys love; only lust is left. It makes love something closer to the animal instinct --\nmechanical, unconscious and ugly too, because the moment you want to possess somebody you start destroying that person. If you cling to the person he starts escaping from you because nobody wants to be imprisoned. Freedom is a far higher goal than love; love can be sacrificed for freedom, but freedom cannot be sacrificed for love.\nSo if love wants to survive -- and it is a beautiful phenomenon -- then it has to find a way to be in tune with freedom. And that's what I mean by this other direction, when love is non-attached, non-clinging, non-possessive. Then love rises to the heights of prayer, it becomes something spiritual. In that sense Jesus is right when he says god is love.\nLove is not lust. and to make it lust is to miss the great opportunity of rising to\nthe ultimate peaks of freedom. joy and bliss. And the miracle is when you don't cling to the other he has no need to escape from you. When you allow freedom he allows you freedom; when you allow freedom there is no need, not at all, to go somewhere else, because you are not only fulfilling his love need, you are also fulfilling a higher need\n-- the need for freedom.\nWhen love is non-attached, you never interfere with the other's space. You reject his space, his territory; you respect his aloneness. If he wants to be alone you don't feel offended; it is his birthright to be alone. In fact he can be with you only if he is allowed to be alone. If you force yourself on the other person, if you don't allow him to be alone, if you trespass his territory, then he may be physically with you but spiritually you are far apart, thousands of miles apart -- and that creates a vicious circle. If you feel that the person you love is not spiritually with you, you become more possessive; you start closing all the possible doors from where he can escape. And the more you create this state, the farther away he is from you -- you are murdering your love yourself.\nLove cannot exist as lust. As lust it is only a corpse; as freedom it has eternal life.\n-- How long will you be here?\n-- Two weeks.\n-- Then come back for a longer period. This is not being like a German. (The group is laughing but the joke seems to be lost on Viraga. Gayan, sitting by her side to help with translation, begins to explain.) This is being like a German: a joke needs to be told twice, and then too he smiles just to be polite! (Presumably Gayan has interpreted the joke for Viraga, but the latter remains unsmiling. Osho chuckles.) Gayan, explain to her. (to a slightly perplexed Viraga) Come back again!\nTRUTH: NOT LOST, JUST MISLAID\n(Osho is addressing Swami Sumaran, his name means remembering.) We have simply forgotten about it because we have become too engaged in the outside world, too occupied. But the inner has been forgotten, there is no space for it. Our consciousness is completely covered with outside information and we go on\ncollecting layer upon layers. We become focussed on the outside so the inner world is at our back; but not for a single moment is it lost. Hence this word 'sumaran' is one of the 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nmost important words in the whole history of religion.\nGurdjieff used to call it self-remembering and Buddha used to call it sammasati, right-remembering and Krishnamurti calls it awareness. These are different names but the basic point is that you have to turn in and to see what is there. And that's what meditation is all about: finding a few moments here and there, whenever possible, so that you can turn off from the outside world and turn in.\nSlowly slowly it becomes easier, smooth, so smooth that any moment you can close your eyes and the whole world with all its worries, problems, tensions and anxieties, disappears and suddenly you are diving deep into a calm, peaceful, cool being. And slowly slowly one becomes capable of remaining aware of both the outside and the inner.\nThe first thing is to be aware of the inner, the second thing happens automatically: you go on working outside but a subtle undercurrent of inner awareness persists; even in deep sleep it goes on persisting. The day it is present twenty-four hours a day one becomes a Buddha, one becomes a Christ.\nSumaran is the name of the method. SANNYAS IS OPENNESS\nGod is not to be searched for anywhere; one just has to become receptive and god comes. And by 'god' I don't mean a person but an experience -- the experience of eternity, the experience of truth, of love, of freedom, of bliss, the experience of all that is our innermost longing. But we have to be receptive.\nPeople are living very closed lives, like monads. Leibnitzian monads -- windowless, doorless, completely closed. There is no way for them to reach\nothers or to allow others to reach them.\nOne has to become very vulnerable and open. Yes, there is a risk in being open because you can be hurt very easily. If you are open anybody can hurt you; if you are vulnerable you can be exploited, deceived, cheated. If you keep your doors and windows open things can be stolen, you can be murdered. That's why people are afraid of being open. They are even afraid of being open to their lovers, friends, parents, children\n-- they are simply afraid. They only come close to a person very cautiously, and that too only to a certain extent, not wholly, always withholding so they can withdraw any moment if the thing becomes too much, or the danger is too much; or if the insecurity becomes clear they can immediately withdraw.\nPeople live like turtles carrying their shells. Yes, in certain moments they bring their necks out and they look around. Just a little danger and the neck goes in. The turtle is almost dead, unmoving -- that's how people are. But this is no way to find truth, this is no way to allow god to enter you.\nOne has to drop this turtle-like existence, this Leibnitzian monad-like life. One has to open all the windows, all the doors; one has to take the risk. What is there to lose?\nA Zen monk, Lin Chi, was lying down in his hut looking at the full moon from the window. He had only one blanket -- that was all that he possessed -- and it was a cold winter night so he was lying on his bed covered with the blanket enjoying the full moon through the window. A thief entered. Lin Chi felt very embarrassed, embarrassed, because the thief had come at least five miles -- the town was that far away --\nand he would not be able to find anything, the hut was empty. That was Lin Chi's embarrassment.\nSo he gave the blanket to the thief and said 'Please accept this, don't say no. I am a very poor man but you are the first man who has made a bit, a little bit rich. I am grateful to you! Just the idea that a thief even visits me is so gratifying that you need not feel obliged; I am not giving this blanket to you, but I will not accept your no.'\nThe thief was so puzzled, shocked, afraid too -- 'What kind of man is this? To\nwhere have I come? This man looks mad!' -- he simply escaped with the blanket.\nLin Chi wrote a small haiku. Sitting on the window he wept, and with tears in his eyes he wrote this small haiku which says 'It would have been beautiful if I could have given this moon to that thief. But I am such a poor man -- I have only an old blanket. I would have liked to give this full moon to him.'\nWhat have we got to lose? Seeing this one becomes open. That's the way of the sannyasin; one becomes open -- open to love, open to friendship, open to all kinds of sharing. One drops withdrawing, one indulges in every kind of experience because one cannot predict from where, from what direction, god will enter one's being. One simply lives totally, intensely, passionately, in a welcoming state; one is simply a welcome. And then it is not far away, then any moment god is possible.\nWhenever you are totally open, with no strings attached, immediately god becomes possible. And unless god becomes possible life is a sheer wastage.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\n(Osho speaks further on the capacity to receive.)\nThe cloud of bliss is always available, it is always ready to shower, to bathe us, but we are closed or upside-down or with so many leakages. These three things have to be changed. We have to be right-side up, otherwise the rain can go on and on showering but if you have put your bucket upside-down it will remain empty.\nSecondly, it has to be without holes. And people have so many holes ... in fact they are just holes and nothing else!\nI have heard a great philosopher was watching a fisherman making a net and he was watching with such wonder that the fisherman also became curious about why he was standing and watching. So he said 'You look so interested -- what is\nthe matter?' The philosopher said 'You are doing miracles -- putting such small holes together -- such neat, clean small holes together. I have never seen such a thing! Putting holes together is really a wonderful job, something magical!'\nThat's how people are, just holes together. So even if they are right-side up the water comes in but goes out again.\nAnd thirdly, even if they don't have holes they are so full of dirt and rubbish that the moment the water touches them it becomes dirty, undrinkable, polluted, or maybe they are so full that the water has no space there; again they remain empty.\nRemember, god is always ready. The guest is ready to come in but the host is fast asleep. The guest even knock, on the doors but the host goes on rationalising that it may be just wind or maybe a passerby, he goes on rationalising and never opens the door. And it is always god who wants to be your guest.\nMy sannyasins have to learn to be guests in god's heart and hosts for god to enter their heart. And both these things happen together if you allow god into you, you are allowed into god. Then the host and the guest disappear into each other and they become one entity. That oneness, that organic unity where you don't have any definition, where you don't have any boundary line around you, where you are dissolved into the ocean like a small dewdrop, is the goal of sannyas. You don't lose anything, you become the ocean; you only lose the small boundary of the drop but you gain infinity.\nSo be ready to lose the smallness, the pettiness, so that you can become the vast, the infinite. It is our birthright, it has to be claimed.\nSONG SONG YOU\n(... everybody has one.)\nOne of the great poets, Walt Whitman, has written a song of the self in which he say, 'I sing myself.' He is one of the most important poets in the whole history of humanity. What he says is significant; there is something of the mystic in it. Had he been in the East he would have become a Buddha. Particularly these two poets from the West, Whitman and Blake ... if they had been in the East they would have become Buddhas. They were already on the verge of it, but there was no supporting background in the West. They remained just on the boundary\nline -- one step more and they would have stepped into god -- but still there are beautiful fragments in their poetry.\nIf you come across this song of the self meditate over it. This is my whole teaching here, that everybody is born with a song inside and unless it is sung, one remains miserable. The moment you have sung your song bliss happens, explodes. You have arrived home because you have poured your heart into existence. In that very creative pouring one becomes part of the whole; all separation disappears, the ego is dissolved, and with the ego, birth and death disappear. Jesus calls it life abundant. But nobody can attain it without being creative.\nThat is one of my basic insistences; one of my most important emphases is on creativity. In the past the so-called religious people have been very uncreative. That has been the cause of humanity not becoming really religious, of religion becoming only an hypocrisy. Anything to be true, authentically true, has to be creative.\nSing your song, dance your dance, do whatsoever is your inner feeling to do. I can help you to find the right ear which can hear the still small voice within -- then follow it!\nThe function of the master is to throw you back upon yourself totally so that you can listen to your heart and then follow it. The master cannot give you a map of the journey; that map has to be discovered by you.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nIt is written within your being but the master can help you in every possible way to reach that inner-most core where you can read the writing that you have carried with yourself forever, but which you have not looked at.\nHIS PRESENCE, OUR PATH\n(This is the last address of the book. It's to Satmarga... and you.) There is only one true path to god but there are millions of paths which are pseudo. And it is really difficult to find the right path. But if one is a sincere seeker, if one is ready to risk all, sooner or later one finds it It is a gamble, and before you can knock on the right door you will have to knock on many doors which are not doors at all; they are only painted doors -- they look doors from far away. But a few indications can be given to the right seeker.\nOne is that the true path never exists as a tradition. The true path exists only as a master. While Jesus is alive it exists, while Buddha is alive it exists. The moment Buddha stops breathing the true path disappears.\nThen what is left is just words, dead, meaningless, just scholarly jargon -- in other words, in simple words, just bullshit. (laughter) Then people carry it for centuries and they go on analysing the bullshit and searching, researching, and finding great things in it! (laughter) They have to find things because they have put so much energy into it. If nothing is there then they look like fools, so they have to invent something.\nThe true path never exists as a tradition. it always exists as a living master. The true path never exists in the scriptures, it only exists when the awakened person is speaking to you, because only then are those words alive. Their life is derived from the awakened person's consciousness. No book can ever be alive. The Bible, the Gita, the Koran -- no book can ever be alive. A book is just like a picture of a sunset: it is not the sunset. You can have a beautiful picture of a lamp in your room but when it is dark that picture won't help (laughter). Even to look at that picture you will need light.\nSo when there is an alive master, if he wants to reveal the secret of the bible and the Koran and the Dhammapada, it is possible; without the master those scripture, are just pictures -- beautiful pictures -- of lamps which exist no more.\nThe true path is always original, never conventional, because truth always happens in a new way to each being; it is never repetitive. The way it happened to Buddha it has not happened to me, the way it has happened to me it is not going to happen to you. Each individual is so unique, that's why the truth and its happening is going to be unique.\nThe master cannot give you the truth, he can only give you hint, to find it. It has\nto be found within you and nowhere else. Nobody can give it to you; it is untransferrable. So whosoever says that he is going to give you the truth, know well that he knows nothing. He is exploiting you, he is a pseudo person. The true master helps you to find the truth within you but he never gives it to you.\nIn short, the true path is a love affair between the master and the disciple. It is a meeting of two hearts. It is not an intellectual question at all, it is a communion; only love can say something about it. It is trust, hence I say it is a gamble. You are risking all that you know for something of which you know nothing. And you are going with a man who, according to all normal considerations, is almost mad (laughter). He is certainly abnormal!\nJesus is abnormal, Buddha is abnormal, Zarathustra is abnormal. These are not normal people, they are abnormal because they above the normal psychology uses the word 'abnormal' in a very wrong way. When you read the word 'abnormal' in a psychology book, read 'subnormal'. That's what they mean.

diary, which has been scanned and cleaned up. It is for reference

A man can become a Christian from being a Hindu but that is not
conversion. He only changes his thoughts, he remains the same; there is
no inner change in his consciousness.</p><p>As a Hindu he was worshipping Krishna, as a Christian he will worship
Christ, but the worshipper is the same; only the idols have been
changed. From one prison he has moved to another prison; he is not free
yet.</p><p>By conversion I mean a transformation of consciousness -- not of the
mind, not of thoughts, but of awareness. When a man becomes absolutely
aware within himself he has gone through a radical change.</p><p>That's the meaning of Parivarto -- and that's the definition of
sannyas.</p><p>I don't give you a new ideology I don't give you a new religion. I
simply help you to move from unconsciousness towards consciousness from
a state of sleep towards a state of awakening. Except for the awakened
person nobody is</p><p>religious.</p><p>(Osho speaks on the difference between knowledge and wisdom to Ma
Sanmati -</p><p>- her name means right knowing. The question is not of knowing more
or less but of going asleep or awake Osho reiterates.) For thousands of
years the stupid religious people have been arguing about whether Buddha
knows more or Jesus whether Krishna knows more or Buddha, whether Buddha
knows more or Lao Tzu. There are all fools, blind people arguing about
light. They can go on arguing for eternity and they will not come to any
conclusion because light has to be seen, not argued about. There is no
question of more or less; all the awakened people are the same. They
have come to the same silence, the same profound peace. It is not a
question of quantity, so you cannot have more or less. It is not the
dimension of quantity at all; it is a qualitative revolution. One is
simply awakened, not more or less. That is Sanmati -- true awakening,
true understanding, true knowing, true wisdom, true awareness. All these
meaning are involved in that simple word, 'sanmati'. It contains the
whole of all the religions, the secret.</p><p>Avoid information and insist on transformation. MENTAL-GO-ROUND</p><p>We live in a kind of restlessness. Mind consists of restlessness and
nothing else. It knows no rest; day in, day out, it goes on spinning and
weaving thoughts, dreams and fantasies. From the cradle to the grave it
is continuously working; it cannot exist without this constant
occupation. It is like peddling a bicycle, if you go on peddling it,,it
keeps moving; the moment you stop peddling it, it falls over. Its whole
support is in constant movement. And that's exactly the case with the
mind.</p><p>To be in absolute rest means to get out of this constant peddling.
Stop co- operating with the mind and its occupations, because it is your
energy that keeps it going on.</p><p>Meditation means withdrawing your energy from the mind. The moment
your energy is withdrawn the 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:justify id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished>Osho's books on

life. Then you live in a relaxed way, then there is great silence in
you. And out of that silence whatsoever you do is right, out of that
rest your actions become beautiful. They carry something of your inner
peace, they vibrate with your inner music. Your actions, your words,
your gestures, even your silences are full, overflowing with your new
being.</p><p>Meditation means rest, absolute rest. If mind is occupation
meditation is rest. If mind is a constant chasing after goals then
meditation is dropping all chasing and all goals. In that stillness you
become capable of miracles -- and everyone is entitled to those
miracles. But mind is impotent.</p><p>Beware of the mind and get out of it. Getting out of it is entering
your own innermost core -- and that is the only temple I know of where
god lives.</p><p>BE A SPIRITUAL SWINGER</p><p>(... be a non-clinger. Osho is talking to Ma Viraga, a German
sannyasin.) Love can have two kinds of expressions. It can move in two
directions, one is that of attachment, possessiveness, clinging, and the
other is of non-attachment, non- possessiveness, non-clinging.</p><p>The first direction destroys love; only lust is left. It makes love
something closer to the animal instinct --</p><p>mechanical, unconscious and ugly too, because the moment you want to
possess somebody you start destroying that person. If you cling to the
person he starts escaping from you because nobody wants to be
imprisoned. Freedom is a far higher goal than love; love can be
sacrificed for freedom, but freedom cannot be sacrificed for love.</p><p>So if love wants to survive -- and it is a beautiful phenomenon --
then it has to find a way to be in tune with freedom. And that's what I
mean by this other direction, when love is non-attached, non-clinging,
non-possessive. Then love rises to the heights of prayer, it becomes
something spiritual. In that sense Jesus is right when he says god is
love.</p><p>Love is not lust. and to make it lust is to miss the great
opportunity of rising to</p><p>the ultimate peaks of freedom. joy and bliss. And the miracle is when
you don't cling to the other he has no need to escape from you. When you
allow freedom he allows you freedom; when you allow freedom there is no
need, not at all, to go somewhere else, because you are not only
fulfilling his love need, you are also fulfilling a higher need</p><p>-- the need for freedom.</p><p>When love is non-attached, you never interfere with the other's
space. You reject his space, his territory; you respect his aloneness.
If he wants to be alone you don't feel offended; it is his birthright to
be alone. In fact he can be with you only if he is allowed to be alone.
If you force yourself on the other person, if you don't allow him to be
alone, if you trespass his territory, then he may be physically with you
but spiritually you are far apart, thousands of miles apart -- and that
creates a vicious circle. If you feel that the person you love is not
spiritually with you, you become more possessive; you start closing all
the possible doors from where he can escape. And the more you create
this state, the farther away he is from you -- you are murdering your
love yourself.</p><p>Love cannot exist as lust. As lust it is only a corpse; as freedom it
has eternal life.</p><p>-- How long will you be here?</p><p>-- Two weeks.</p><p>-- Then come back for a longer period. This is not being like a
German. (The group is laughing but the joke seems to be lost on Viraga.
Gayan, sitting by her side to help with translation, begins to explain.)
This is being like a German: a joke needs to be told twice, and then too
he smiles just to be polite! (Presumably Gayan has interpreted the joke
for Viraga, but the latter remains unsmiling. Osho chuckles.) Gayan,
explain to her. (to a slightly perplexed Viraga) Come back again!</p><p>TRUTH: NOT LOST, JUST MISLAID</p><p>(Osho is addressing Swami Sumaran, his name means remembering.) We
have simply forgotten about it because we have become too engaged in the
outside world, too occupied. But the inner has been forgotten, there is
no space for it. Our consciousness is completely covered with outside
information and we go on</p><p>collecting layer upon layers. We become focussed on the outside so
the inner world is at our back; but not for a single moment is it lost.
Hence this word 'sumaran' is one of the 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>most important words in the whole history of religion.</p><p>Gurdjieff used to call it self-remembering and Buddha used to call it
sammasati, right-remembering and Krishnamurti calls it awareness. These
are different names but the basic point is that you have to turn in and
to see what is there. And that's what meditation is all about: finding a
few moments here and there, whenever possible, so that you can turn off
from the outside world and turn in.</p><p>Slowly slowly it becomes easier, smooth, so smooth that any moment
you can close your eyes and the whole world with all its worries,
problems, tensions and anxieties, disappears and suddenly you are diving
deep into a calm, peaceful, cool being. And slowly slowly one becomes
capable of remaining aware of both the outside and the inner.</p><p>The first thing is to be aware of the inner, the second thing happens
automatically: you go on working outside but a subtle undercurrent of
inner awareness persists; even in deep sleep it goes on persisting. The
day it is present twenty-four hours a day one becomes a Buddha, one
becomes a Christ.</p><p>Sumaran is the name of the method. SANNYAS IS OPENNESS</p><p>God is not to be searched for anywhere; one just has to become
receptive and god comes. And by 'god' I don't mean a person but an
experience -- the experience of eternity, the experience of truth, of
love, of freedom, of bliss, the experience of all that is our innermost
longing. But we have to be receptive.</p><p>People are living very closed lives, like monads. Leibnitzian monads
-- windowless, doorless, completely closed. There is no way for them to
reach</p><p>others or to allow others to reach them.</p><p>One has to become very vulnerable and open. Yes, there is a risk in
being open because you can be hurt very easily. If you are open anybody
can hurt you; if you are vulnerable you can be exploited, deceived,
cheated. If you keep your doors and windows open things can be stolen,
you can be murdered. That's why people are afraid of being open. They
are even afraid of being open to their lovers, friends, parents,
children</p><p>-- they are simply afraid. They only come close to a person very
cautiously, and that too only to a certain extent, not wholly, always
withholding so they can withdraw any moment if the thing becomes too
much, or the danger is too much; or if the insecurity becomes clear they
can immediately withdraw.</p><p>People live like turtles carrying their shells. Yes, in certain
moments they bring their necks out and they look around. Just a little
danger and the neck goes in. The turtle is almost dead, unmoving --
that's how people are. But this is no way to find truth, this is no way
to allow god to enter you.</p><p>One has to drop this turtle-like existence, this Leibnitzian
monad-like life. One has to open all the windows, all the doors; one has
to take the risk. What is there to lose?</p><p>A Zen monk, Lin Chi, was lying down in his hut looking at the full
moon from the window. He had only one blanket -- that was all that he
possessed -- and it was a cold winter night so he was lying on his bed
covered with the blanket enjoying the full moon through the window. A
thief entered. Lin Chi felt very embarrassed, embarrassed, because the
thief had come at least five miles -- the town was that far away --</p><p>and he would not be able to find anything, the hut was empty. That
was Lin Chi's embarrassment.</p><p>So he gave the blanket to the thief and said 'Please accept this,
don't say no. I am a very poor man but you are the first man who has
made a bit, a little bit rich. I am grateful to you! Just the idea that
a thief even visits me is so gratifying that you need not feel obliged;
I am not giving this blanket to you, but I will not accept your no.'</p><p>The thief was so puzzled, shocked, afraid too -- 'What kind of man is
this? To</p><p>where have I come? This man looks mad!' -- he simply escaped with the
blanket.</p><p>Lin Chi wrote a small haiku. Sitting on the window he wept, and with
tears in his eyes he wrote this small haiku which says 'It would have
been beautiful if I could have given this moon to that thief. But I am
such a poor man -- I have only an old blanket. I would have liked to
give this full moon to him.'</p><p>What have we got to lose? Seeing this one becomes open. That's the
way of the sannyasin; one becomes open -- open to love, open to
friendship, open to all kinds of sharing. One drops withdrawing, one
indulges in every kind of experience because one cannot predict from
where, from what direction, god will enter one's being. One simply lives
totally, intensely, passionately, in a welcoming state; one is simply a
welcome. And then it is not far away, then any moment god is
possible.</p><p>Whenever you are totally open, with no strings attached, immediately
god becomes possible. And unless god becomes possible life is a sheer
wastage.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

to bathe us, but we are closed or upside-down or with so many leakages.
These three things have to be changed. We have to be right-side up,
otherwise the rain can go on and on showering but if you have put your
bucket upside-down it will remain empty.</p><p>Secondly, it has to be without holes. And people have so many holes
... in fact they are just holes and nothing else!</p><p>I have heard a great philosopher was watching a fisherman making a
net and he was watching with such wonder that the fisherman also became
curious about why he was standing and watching. So he said 'You look so
interested -- what is</p><p>the matter?' The philosopher said 'You are doing miracles -- putting
such small holes together -- such neat, clean small holes together. I
have never seen such a thing! Putting holes together is really a
wonderful job, something magical!'</p><p>That's how people are, just holes together. So even if they are
right-side up the water comes in but goes out again.</p><p>And thirdly, even if they don't have holes they are so full of dirt
and rubbish that the moment the water touches them it becomes dirty,
undrinkable, polluted, or maybe they are so full that the water has no
space there; again they remain empty.</p><p>Remember, god is always ready. The guest is ready to come in but the
host is fast asleep. The guest even knock, on the doors but the host
goes on rationalising that it may be just wind or maybe a passerby, he
goes on rationalising and never opens the door. And it is always god who
wants to be your guest.</p><p>My sannyasins have to learn to be guests in god's heart and hosts for
god to enter their heart. And both these things happen together if you
allow god into you, you are allowed into god. Then the host and the
guest disappear into each other and they become one entity. That
oneness, that organic unity where you don't have any definition, where
you don't have any boundary line around you, where you are dissolved
into the ocean like a small dewdrop, is the goal of sannyas. You don't
lose anything, you become the ocean; you only lose the small boundary of
the drop but you gain infinity.</p><p>So be ready to lose the smallness, the pettiness, so that you can
become the vast, the infinite. It is our birthright, it has to be
claimed.</p><p>SONG SONG YOU</p><p>(... everybody has one.)</p><p>One of the great poets, Walt Whitman, has written a song of the self
in which he say, 'I sing myself.' He is one of the most important poets
in the whole history of humanity. What he says is significant; there is
something of the mystic in it. Had he been in the East he would have
become a Buddha. Particularly these two poets from the West, Whitman and
Blake ... if they had been in the East they would have become Buddhas.
They were already on the verge of it, but there was no supporting
background in the West. They remained just on the boundary</p><p>line -- one step more and they would have stepped into god -- but
still there are beautiful fragments in their poetry.</p><p>If you come across this song of the self meditate over it. This is my
whole teaching here, that everybody is born with a song inside and
unless it is sung, one remains miserable. The moment you have sung your
song bliss happens, explodes. You have arrived home because you have
poured your heart into existence. In that very creative pouring one
becomes part of the whole; all separation disappears, the ego is
dissolved, and with the ego, birth and death disappear. Jesus calls it
life abundant. But nobody can attain it without being creative.</p><p>That is one of my basic insistences; one of my most important
emphases is on creativity. In the past the so-called religious people
have been very uncreative. That has been the cause of humanity not
becoming really religious, of religion becoming only an hypocrisy.
Anything to be true, authentically true, has to be creative.</p><p>Sing your song, dance your dance, do whatsoever is your inner feeling
to do. I can help you to find the right ear which can hear the still
small voice within -- then follow it!</p><p>The function of the master is to throw you back upon yourself totally
so that you can listen to your heart and then follow it. The master
cannot give you a map of the journey; that map has to be discovered by
you.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>It is written within your being but the master can help you in every
possible way to reach that inner-most core where you can read the
writing that you have carried with yourself forever, but which you have
not looked at.</p><p>HIS PRESENCE, OUR PATH</p><p>(This is the last address of the book. It's to Satmarga... and you.)
There is only one true path to god but there are millions of paths which
are pseudo. And it is really difficult to find the right path. But if
one is a sincere seeker, if one is ready to risk all, sooner or later
one finds it It is a gamble, and before you can knock on the right door
you will have to knock on many doors which are not doors at all; they
are only painted doors -- they look doors from far away. But a few
indications can be given to the right seeker.</p><p>One is that the true path never exists as a tradition. The true path
exists only as a master. While Jesus is alive it exists, while Buddha is
alive it exists. The moment Buddha stops breathing the true path
disappears.</p><p>Then what is left is just words, dead, meaningless, just scholarly
jargon -- in other words, in simple words, just bullshit. (laughter)
Then people carry it for centuries and they go on analysing the bullshit
and searching, researching, and finding great things in it! (laughter)
They <em>have</em> to find things because they have put so much energy
into it. If nothing is there then they look like fools, so they have to
invent something.</p><p>The true path never exists as a tradition. it always exists as a
living master. The true path never exists in the scriptures, it only
exists when the awakened person is speaking to you, because only then
are those words alive. Their life is derived from the awakened person's
consciousness. No book can ever be alive. The Bible, the Gita, the Koran
-- no book can ever be alive. A book is just like a picture of a sunset:
it is not the sunset. You can have a beautiful picture of a lamp in your
room but when it is dark that picture won't help (laughter). Even to
look at that picture you will need light.</p><p>So when there is an alive master, if he wants to reveal the secret of
the bible and the Koran and the Dhammapada, it is possible; without the
master those scripture, are just pictures -- beautiful pictures -- of
lamps which exist no more.</p><p>The true path is always original, never conventional, because truth
always happens in a new way to each being; it is never repetitive. The
way it happened to Buddha it has not happened to me, the way it has
happened to me it is not going to happen to you. Each individual is so
unique, that's why the truth and its happening is going to be
unique.</p><p>The master cannot give you the truth, he can only give you hint, to
find it. It has</p><p>to be found within you and nowhere else. Nobody can give it to you;
it is untransferrable. So whosoever says that he is going to give you
the truth, know well that he knows nothing. He is exploiting you, he is
a pseudo person. The true master helps you to find the truth within you
but he never gives it to you.</p><p><a href=part3 class=a>In short, the true path is a love affair
between the master and the disciple. It is a meeting of two hearts. It
is not an intellectual question at all, it is a communion</a>; only love
can say something about it. It is trust, hence I say it is a gamble. You
are risking all that you know for something of which you know nothing.
And you are going with a man who, according to all normal
considerations, is almost mad (laughter). He is certainly abnormal!</p><p><a href=part10 class=a>Jesus is abnormal, Buddha is abnormal,
Zarathustra is abnormal. These are not normal people, they are abnormal
because they above the normal psycholog</a>y uses the word 'abnormal' in
a very wrong way. When you read the word 'abnormal' in a psychology
book, read 'subnormal'. That's what they mean. Subnormal means below the
normal, abnormal should mean above the normal.</p><p>But don't be worried (laughter)... because now nothing can be done
about its you are already on the right path and there is no going back,
no turning back.</p><p>Whosoever comes with me, whenever he wants to go back, there is no
way. I go on destroying the bridge. The moment you cross the bridge, the
bridge disappears. I go on throwing away the ladder, so you can only go
forward.</p><p>My sannyasins don't have a reverse gear at all!</p><h1 style=padding-top:3pt;text-indent:0;text-align:center id=table-of-contents>Table of Contents</h1><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part29>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a></p><p>  </p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://osho.lol/posts/going_all_the_way/part3/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Chapter title: None</span>

It is for reference purposes only.]\nBRIDGE OR BLOCKADE?\n(Osho talks on the relationship between existence and the person of ecstasy, as opposed to the misery-maker.)\nThe blissful person is always preferred by the whole existence. The miserable at the most is tolerated or ignored. The miserable cannot really be part of existence; he himself creates barriers, he makes walls around himself. The blissful person creates bridges, he relates with life, he relates because he rejoices in relating.\nHe is open, available. Out of his bliss comes his trust. And remember, when you trust existence, existence trusts you.\nExistence always pays you in the same coin. A sannyasin has to learn the art of being continuously blissful, irrespective of the situation. That's the difference between happiness and bliss. Happiness depends on a certain situation. The moment the situation disappears, happiness disappears; it is situational. Bliss is non-situational, it is always there. Whatsoever happens on the outside makes no difference.\nOne is blissful in life, one is blissful in death too, in success, in failure, in richness, in poverty, in sickness, in health. The polarities make no difference; one remains balanced exactly in the middle. To remain balanced like a tightrope walk is the whole meaning of sannyas.\nTO VERBALISE IS TO FALSIFY\n(Deva means god, or even better, godliness, Osho explains to Swami Deva Tony.) God is not a person but a presence, not a flower but a fragrance; hence no statue can do justice to god.\nHe has no boundary, no shape, no form.\nThe word 'god' can mislead one, because it gives one the feeling that he is a person; then he must be somewhere, then he must be someone. The whole idea of god the father, the supreme self, the creator -- all these attributes have arisen because of a misinterpretation. To think of god as a person is to miss the point.\nGod is an experience like love. You cannot visualise love, you cannot visualise god either; you can experience both.\nAnd the word 'Tony' means beyond praise. There is no possibility of praising god because what can we say about the ultimate? Whatsoever we say will be wrong. Lao Tzu says that to say the truth is to falsify it.\nThe moment you utter it, it is no longer the truth, it becomes a lie. And all our prayers in the churches, in the 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\ntemples, in the mosques, are nothing but praises of god: 'You are great, you are compassionate, you are this, you are that...' and god is beyond praise. All our words fall short, they are bound to fall short. They are needed for a hum an dialogue, they are useful, but the whole language is man's creation.\nGod knows no language. So to be in utter silence is the only true prayer. To say\nanything is to destroy it.\nAnd silence has one beautiful thing about it: it is neither Christian nor Hindu nor Mohammedan.\nWhatsoever you say will be either Christian or Hindu or Mohammedan, because words have associations; words come from the past, from tradition. The Hindu praises god in one way, the Mohammedan in another, the Christian in still another. But silence cannot be different -- it is one. Then the Mohammedan and the Christian and the Hindu and the Jew and the Jaina and the Buddhist are all silent; then all religions have disappeared. Religions belong to the world of words, now what remains is religiousness. God has disappeared, what remains now is godliness -- the fragrance, the presence. It is felt in silence.\nMy whole effort here is to help you to be blissfully silent. And remember that condition -- blissfully, because one can be silent in a dead way, in a cold way, in a kind of indifference. That silence is not prayer, it is not alive at all -- how can it be prayer? It cannot breathe, it has no heartbeat; it is ice-cold.\nThe silence must be at the same time a song, it should have the flavour of the song. It will not have words but it will have a tune. It will be pure music, it will be dance. Only then, when silence is blissful, does one come in contact with godliness.\n(Jutta happens to follow next. Before he hands her the name-sheet Osho pauses and grins.) Now your name creates a trouble for me. Jutta means praise of the lord -- but I have my own ways!\nThis will be your full name: Ma Shanti Jutta. Shanti means silent -- silent praise of the lord. Jutta is Hebrew and I am also a Jew so I know how to trick them! (laughter) There is no possibility of praising god. Whatsoever we say will come out of our minds because only the mind speaks; the heart is always silent. And it is the heart that has to communicate with god, not the head.\nThe head is needed for the world and the heart for the further shore, for the beyond. The head has no possibility of even comprehending the beyond. It is beyond it, that's why it is called the beyond, but it is within the heart. What is beyond the head is not beyond the heart. What is beyond the head is within the heart, it is pulsating there already.\nGod is our very heartbeat, our life! To me life and god are absolutely synonymous; they don't mean two different things -- perhaps they are different petals of the same lotus.\nIn the East we have called the lotus one-thousand petalled. This one-thousand petalled lotus does not exist anywhere on the outside, it is the lotus of consciousness. And it is one-thousand petalled because consciousness has multi- dimensionality: love is one of the petals, freedom another, bliss still another, truth...\nand so on and so forth. All the great values for which we are searching and longing and for which we are thirsty and hungry, are all petals of the same lotus.\nAnd by getting hold of one petal you will be able to reach the centre of the lotus, there is no need to go through all the petals. And once you have reached the centre you will know that all the petals are joined at the centre.\nThe journey begins in the heart and also ends in the heart. Words, thoughts, ideologies, religions, dogmas, doctrines -- they all belong to the head. The rabbis, the pundits, the popes -- they all belong to the head. The authentically religious person is nothing but a pure heart, an innocent heart; he is a kind of heartfulness, an overflowing heartfulness. But that experience is utterly silent, inexpressible, wordless.\nBecause it is wordless, it is infinite, vast, immense. Falling into that silence where you can hear your own heartbeat is the praise of the lord.\nSo learn to be silent, bow down in silence to the earth, to the trees, to the moon, to the sun. It does not matter what the object is, what matters is bowing down -- surrender, that feeling of gratitude. Wherever one is full of gratitude there is a temple. Wherever such a man sits, that place becomes sacred; wherever he moves he transforms the energy because he carries his own Buddhafield around him. His silence, his joy, his love, his compassion -- it is all there, but absolutely silent.\nA COP OF YOUR OWN CONSCIOUSNESS\n(Meditation means watching the traffic of your thoughts, Osho explains to another sannyasin.) That watchfulness is meditation. It is not the chanting of a mantra. That is sheer stupidity. You can call 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nit transcendental stupidity (laughter)... but it is not meditation.\nMeditation is simply watchfulness -- doing nothing but watching. Watching is not something to be done; you are simply there and the mind is moving, and you go on looking at it. In that very looking a miracle starts happening. The more intense your look, the more thoughts disappear. Moments come when suddenly your awareness is at a peak, at the optimum. In that pause the mind disappears completely. Then one comes to know the arithmetic: if the mind is ninety-nine per cent, then awareness is one per cent; if awareness is ten per cent, then the mind is ninety per cent; if the awareness is fifty per cent, then mind is fifty per cent; the moment awareness is ninety-nine per cent the mind is one per cent. And when that fortunate moment comes when awareness is one hundred per cent, mind is nil. That is the moment when your whole energy takes a quantum leap, when for the first time you become aware of the meaning of life and its splendour.\nAlfred means wise; that is the moment when one becomes wiser when wisdom explodes because now you have the clarity, the perceptiveness, the silence, awareness -- all that is needed for wisdom to arrive.\nYou have prepared the ground. Then not even a single moment is lost; immediately, one becomes a Buddha, a Christ. That's what wisdom is: to become a Buddha, a Christ. Then one simply knows; without any knowledge one simply knows. And that knowing starts guiding you. Now you have an inner voice, an inner light, and it never commits any mistake, it never takes you in any wrong direction. It is essentially right; it is impossible for it to be wrong.\nYOU CHOOSE THE BLUES\n(It's up to us, Osho reminds us again tonight.)\nMisery is a sin, and blissfulness is virtue, although for centuries just the opposite has been taught.\nPeople have been told that if you sin you will suffer, and If you are virtuous you will be rewarded by bliss.\nThat is putting the whole thing upside-down.\nI say if you are blissful virtue will follow you. Your life will have a certain sacredness. Your actions will be inevitably beautiful, graceful, in tune with existence, never against the law of the universe, always in accordance with it.\nAnd if you are miserable, whatsoever you do you will do wrong. Out of misery good cannot happen.\nThe miserable person sometimes intends to do good, his intentions are not suspect, but the ultimate result is always bad.\nAnd you can see it all over the world. All the parents are trying to do good for their children, and they are all destroying them too. Their intentions are good, but they are miserable people; they are blind. They have not lived their life in a celebration. Their very vibe is poisonous, so what can good intentions do? That poison will ride upon their good intentions. Their good intentions will never be fulfilled; just the opposite will be the result. The politicians, the priests, are all full of good intentions but the outcome is this chaos in the whole world.\nMy insistence is: first, drop your misery -- and it can be dropped, just like that. It is only a question of not choosing it. It is your choice. You can decide not to be miserable, and then nothing can affect you. You can decide to be blissful. Try tomorrow (laughter). From the very morning decide to be blissful, and see whether what I am saying is possible or not.\nSometimes the old habits may come in; then immediately remind yourself that today you have decided to be blissful. Follow the decision. And if you can do it for one day, you can do it for your whole life.\nIn fact, if a person can be blissful for a single moment, he knows the art. Because you will not get two moments together; you will always get one moment at one time -- and that much of the secret you know!\nRight now you are blissful (laughter)... this is the secret -- just don't forget it! CRIMINAL OR CHRIST\n(Either way, you've got it coming to you because you're a threat to society, Osho warns Ma Prem Amrita.)\nThe only thing in existence that is immortal, that defies death, is love. The body dies, the mind dies --\neverything that begins ends. Only love never dies, because it is our very nature. It never begins, hence it cannot end. It has always been with us; it's our very being.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThe strange thing is, the society is very much against love. It tries in every possible way not to allow your loving nature to surface; it represses it. And then, instead of a humanity we have only a crowd of subhuman beings. And they are really in a mess... because they are no more animals. Animals are in a way happy. At least they don't have the popes to destroy their happiness, to give them commandments. to tell them what to do and what not to do. They live spontaneously; nobody disturbs their spontaneity.\nMan is no more an animal and he is not yet a human. He has been prevented from being human by the vested interests. They don't want him to become animal again so in every way they punish the criminals so nobody falls from this subhuman state. And they punish Buddhas also. It is a strange world: they punish the criminals and they punish the saints, the sages.\nThe real saints are always punished. It is significant that when Jesus was crucified he was crucified just in between two criminals. On that day there were three crosses; on both sides of him there was a thief also crucified with him.\nSociety crucifies the person who falls below humanity because he becomes animal-like, and the society also crucifies the person who goes beyond subhumanity because he becomes godlike. Society is afraid of both, society wants you to be just in the middle. But to be in the middle is a very tense state.\nOne is neither here nor there -- in a limbo, torn apart, one cannot be at ease, one cannot be at home.\nSociety is afraid of the criminal because he will create chaos. Society is afraid of the Christs and Buddhas also because they will also create chaos. In different ways they are both going to create chaos. The animal will create chaos because he will bring violence, aggression, destruction; and the Buddha will create chaos because he will release the energies of love.\nOf course, the chaos created by the Buddhas is beautiful because out of that chaos all the stars are born, out of that chaos is creativity. But the society is against both. Society is going to be against me, too, and against my sannyasins too. So anybody who dares to be with me has to be absolutely ready: ready to risk, ready to gamble. And that is possible only if the relationship with me is of love.\nTwo types of people come to me: a few come intellectually convinced that what I am saying is right --\ntheir relationship with me is very fragile; they will not be able to sacrifice or risk. Whenever things are going good they will be with me, and when things start going bad they will not be with me. Not only that; they can even be against me just to protect themselves.\nBut the real sannyasins happens not out of intellectual conviction but out of a heartfelt longing. With the real sannyasin it is a love affair. Then one can sacrifice everything, even life itself, because love is far higher than life. Life is only an opportunity to achieve love, life is only a ladder towards love. Life is mortal, love is immortal, the mortal can be sacrificed for the immortal.\n(Osho seems to pause for a split second, then adds something that makes one look twice new sannyasin.) Remember it -- you will need it in your life.\nGIVE YOUR EGO THE BOOT\n(... and become god's flute. His name, Prabhupad, means at the feet of the lord -- surrendered, dedicated, Osho tells another new sannyasin.)\nAll that we have to surrender is the ego. It is in fact rubbish, but we don't have anything else. Everything else is god-given; only ego is what we have created.\nThat which is already god-given cannot be surrendered, only that which we have created can be surrendered.\nSannyas means surrendering the ego and relaxing, feeling at home with existence, dropping all conflict and struggle, being in a let-go. And then immense bliss follows, infinite benediction showers; flowers and flowers rain, for the simple reason that you have removed the barrier. They were already showering; it is just that your barrier was not allowing you to have a contact, your eyes were closed. The sun rays were knocking on the doors.\nThe moment you drop the ego you open your eyes, you open your doors, and the sun comes rushing in, and the wind and the rain, and the whole existence suddenly starts flowing through you. You become a flute, and god starts singing beautiful songs on you.\nThat's how a sannyasin has to be -- a hollow bamboo flute. That's my symbol for a sannyasin, the hollow bamboo flute.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nGRATEFUL OR GRUMPY\n(The first is the attitude of the really religious person.) One of the greatest mistakes in life is to take life for granted. It is a gift and one should be grateful for it; one should not take it for granted. We don't deserve it, we have not earned lt; it has simply been given to Us.\nWe are not even worthy of it. And not only has life been given to us, love has been given to us, joy has been given to us, awareness has been given to us. Thousands of gifts are contained in the one gift of life.\nTo feel grateful towards existence is to be religious. But instead of feeling grateful people are continuously complaining. That's the only difference between the irreligious and the religious. The irreligious person is continually\ncomplaining; he is grumpy. And the religious person is contented. He is always thankful because he feels more has been given to him than he could ever ask for.\nAnd that is the way of the sannyasin. LOVERLESS LOVE\n(Love can exist in three ways Osho begins in his address to Ma Premal.) The first is love as a relationship. One is loving only to a certain person, and that too at certain moments.\nWhen the person agrees with you, is according to you, is fulfilling your expectations, when he is just a shadow to you and you can possess him, then you are loving.\nThere are a thousand and one conditions in relationships. The moment any single condition is not fulfilled love disappears. Love turns into hatred any moment. The same person for whom you would have died -- you can kill him. So that is the lowest kind of love, love as relationship.\nYour name, Premal, means the second kind of love. It is not a relationship; one is simply loving. It has nothing to do with somebody in particular, one is loving whether one is alone or with someone. One is loving with the trees, with the river, with the mountains. Sitting alone in one's room one is loving. Then love is just like the fragrance of a flower -- whether somebody is present or not does not matter.\nThis is transforming love from something very ordinary and animal into something extraordinary and human. Now love becomes a quality. That is the meaning of Premal.\nThere is one stage more, higher than that, but first one has to attain this second. And the second is the most important, even more important than the third, the highest, because once the second is there the third is bound to follow. You need not do anything about it.\nThe first is love as a relationship, the second is lovingness and the third is when one becomes love itself, so one is not even conscious that one is loving. In the second there is consciousness a certain self-consciousness that one is loving. That is the only flaw left. But you cannot remove it yourself, because if you do\nthen again you will be there. Then more self-consciousness will arise: 'Look how great I am -- I have removed the last flaw! Now I am love, pure love.' But that 'I' is still there.\nYou cannot do anything; once you have attained to the second, you have to wait for the third -- it comes as a gift from god. It always comes. You deserve it because you have attained the second. Then one day suddenly the self- consciousness disappears and only pure love is left. Everybody will feel it; only you will not be conscious of it. And the more you are without self- consciousness, the more others will feel it.\nSo attain the second, and leave the third for god. We always have to leave something for him to do, otherwise he will be completely unemployed (laughter). And it won't be a good scene: god standing before an employment office in the queue.… That won't be a good sight. We have to leave a few things for god!\nTHE MELODY OF MINDLESSNESS\n(That's the meaning of Omkar, Osho tells the last sannyasin.) It is heard only when all other noise has been dropped, when the mind is without thoughts, without desires; the heart is without feelings, without emotions. When the mind and heart are both absolutely empty, then suddenly you hear something which was always there but which you had never heard; you were so preoccupied with other things.\nSuddenly a great silent music is heard, a soundless sound, just a pure feeling of well-being, as if your 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nwhole body, mind and soul are in a subtle dance, as if each of your cells and fibres is pulsating and humming.

Chuang Tzu Auditorium</h3><p>Archive code: 8011205 ShortTitle: ALLWAY20 Audio:</p><p>No Video:</p><p>No</p><p>[NOTE: This is an unedited tape transcript of an unpublished darshan
diary, which has been scanned and cleaned up. It is for reference
purposes only.]</p><p>BRIDGE OR BLOCKADE?</p><p>(Osho talks on the relationship between existence and the person of
ecstasy, as opposed to the misery-maker.)</p><p>The blissful person is always preferred by the whole existence. The
miserable at the most is tolerated or ignored. The miserable cannot
really be part of existence; he himself creates barriers, he makes walls
around himself. The blissful person creates bridges, he relates with
life, he relates because he rejoices in relating.</p><p>He is open, available. Out of his bliss comes his trust. And
remember, when you trust existence, existence trusts you.</p><p>Existence always pays you in the same coin. A sannyasin has to learn
the art of being continuously blissful, irrespective of the situation.
That's the difference between happiness and bliss. Happiness depends on
a certain situation. The moment the situation disappears, happiness
disappears; it is situational. Bliss is non-situational, it is always
there. Whatsoever happens on the outside makes no difference.</p><p>One is blissful in life, one is blissful in death too, in success, in
failure, in richness, in poverty, in sickness, in health. The polarities
make no difference; one remains balanced exactly in the middle. To
remain balanced like a tightrope walk is the whole meaning of
sannyas.</p><p>TO VERBALISE IS TO FALSIFY</p><p>(Deva means god, or even better, godliness, Osho explains to Swami
Deva Tony.) God is not a person but a presence, not a flower but a
fragrance; hence no statue can do justice to god.</p><p>He has no boundary, no shape, no form.</p><p>The word 'god' can mislead one, because it gives one the feeling that
he is a person; then he must be somewhere, then he must be someone. The
whole idea of god the father, the supreme self, the creator -- all these
attributes have arisen because of a misinterpretation. To think of god
as a person is to miss the point.</p><p>God is an experience like love. You cannot visualise love, you cannot
visualise god either; you can experience both.</p><p>And the word 'Tony' means beyond praise. There is no possibility of
praising god because what can we say about the ultimate? Whatsoever we
say will be wrong. Lao Tzu says that to say the truth is to falsify
it.</p><p>The moment you utter it, it is no longer the truth, it becomes a lie.
And all our prayers in the churches, in the 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>temples, in the mosques, are nothing but praises of god: 'You are
great, you are compassionate, you are this, you are that...' and god is
beyond praise. All our words fall short, they are bound to fall short.
They are needed for a hum an dialogue, they are useful, but the whole
language is man's creation.</p><p>God knows no language. So to be in utter silence is the only true
prayer. To say</p><p>anything is to destroy it.</p><p>And silence has one beautiful thing about it: it is neither Christian
nor Hindu nor Mohammedan.</p><p>Whatsoever you say will be either Christian or Hindu or Mohammedan,
because words have associations; words come from the past, from
tradition. The Hindu praises god in one way, the Mohammedan in another,
the Christian in still another. But silence cannot be different -- it is
one. Then the Mohammedan and the Christian and the Hindu and the Jew and
the Jaina and the Buddhist are all silent; then all religions have
disappeared. Religions belong to the world of words, now what remains is
religiousness. God has disappeared, what remains now is godliness -- the
fragrance, the presence. It is felt in silence.</p><p>My whole effort here is to help you to be blissfully silent. And
remember that condition -- blissfully, because one can be silent in a
dead way, in a cold way, in a kind of indifference. That silence is not
prayer, it is not alive at all -- how can it be prayer? It cannot
breathe, it has no heartbeat; it is ice-cold.</p><p>The silence must be at the same time a song, it should have the
flavour of the song. It will not have words but it will have a tune. It
will be pure music, it will be dance. Only then, when silence is
blissful, does one come in contact with godliness.</p><p>(Jutta happens to follow next. Before he hands her the name-sheet
Osho pauses and grins.) Now your name creates a trouble for me. Jutta
means praise of the lord -- but I have my own ways!</p><p>This will be your full name: Ma Shanti Jutta. Shanti means silent --
silent praise of the lord. Jutta is Hebrew and I am also a Jew so I know
how to trick them! (laughter) There is no possibility of praising god.
Whatsoever we say will come out of our minds because only the mind
speaks; the heart is always silent. And it is the heart that has to
communicate with god, not the head.</p><p>The head is needed for the world and the heart for the further shore,
for the beyond. The head has no possibility of even comprehending the
beyond. It is beyond it, that's why it is called the beyond, but it is
within the heart. What is beyond the head is not beyond the heart. What
is beyond the head is within the heart, it is pulsating there
already.</p><p>God is our very heartbeat, our life! To me life and god are
absolutely synonymous; they don't mean two different things -- perhaps
they are different petals of the same lotus.</p><p>In the East we have called the lotus one-thousand petalled. This
one-thousand petalled lotus does not exist anywhere on the outside, it
is the lotus of consciousness. And it is one-thousand petalled because
consciousness has multi- dimensionality: love is one of the petals,
freedom another, bliss still another, truth...</p><p>and so on and so forth. All the great values for which we are
searching and longing and for which we are thirsty and hungry, are all
petals of the same lotus.</p><p>And by getting hold of one petal you will be able to reach the centre
of the lotus, there is no need to go through all the petals. And once
you have reached the centre you will know that <em>all</em> the petals
are joined at the centre.</p><p>The journey begins in the heart and also ends in the heart. Words,
thoughts, ideologies, religions, dogmas, doctrines -- they all belong to
the head. The rabbis, the pundits, the popes -- they all belong to the
head. The authentically religious person is nothing but a pure heart, an
innocent heart; he is a kind of heartfulness, an overflowing
heartfulness. But that experience is utterly silent, inexpressible,
wordless.</p><p>Because it is wordless, it is infinite, vast, immense. Falling into
that silence where you can hear your own heartbeat is the praise of the
lord.</p><p>So learn to be silent, bow down in silence to the earth, to the
trees, to the moon, to the sun. It does not matter what the object is,
what matters is bowing down -- surrender, that feeling of gratitude.
Wherever one is full of gratitude there is a temple. Wherever such a man
sits, that place becomes sacred; wherever he moves he transforms the
energy because he carries his own Buddhafield around him. His silence,
his joy, his love, his compassion -- it is all there, but absolutely
silent.</p><p>A COP OF YOUR OWN CONSCIOUSNESS</p><p>(Meditation means watching the traffic of your thoughts, Osho
explains to another sannyasin.) That watchfulness is meditation. It is
not the chanting of a mantra. That is sheer stupidity. You can call
1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>it transcendental stupidity (laughter)... but it is not
meditation.</p><p>Meditation is simply watchfulness -- doing nothing but watching.
Watching is not something to be done; you are simply there and the mind
is moving, and you go on looking at it. In that very looking a miracle
starts happening. The more intense your look, the more thoughts
disappear. Moments come when suddenly your awareness is at a peak, at
the optimum. In that pause the mind disappears completely. Then one
comes to know the arithmetic: if the mind is ninety-nine per cent, then
awareness is one per cent; if awareness is ten per cent, then the mind
is ninety per cent; if the awareness is fifty per cent, then mind is
fifty per cent; the moment awareness is ninety-nine per cent the mind is
one per cent. And when that fortunate moment comes when awareness is one
hundred per cent, mind is nil. That is the moment when your whole energy
takes a quantum leap, when for the first time you become aware of the
meaning of life and its splendour.</p><p>Alfred means wise; that is the moment when one becomes wiser when
wisdom explodes because now you have the clarity, the perceptiveness,
the silence, awareness -- all that is needed for wisdom to arrive.</p><p>You have prepared the ground. Then not even a single moment is lost;
immediately, one becomes a Buddha, a Christ. That's what wisdom is: to
become a Buddha, a Christ. Then one simply knows; without any knowledge
one simply knows. And that knowing starts guiding you. Now you have an
inner voice, an inner light, and it never commits any mistake, it never
takes you in any wrong direction. It is essentially right; it is
impossible for it to be wrong.</p><p>YOU CHOOSE THE BLUES</p><p>(It's up to us, Osho reminds us again tonight.)</p><p>Misery is a sin, and blissfulness is virtue, although for centuries
just the opposite has been taught.</p><p>People have been told that if you sin you will suffer, and If you are
virtuous you will be rewarded by bliss.</p><p>That is putting the whole thing upside-down.</p><p>I say if you are blissful virtue will follow you. Your life will have
a certain sacredness. Your actions will be inevitably beautiful,
graceful, in tune with existence, never against the law of the universe,
always in accordance with it.</p><p>And if you are miserable, whatsoever you do you will do wrong. Out of
misery good cannot happen.</p><p>The miserable person sometimes intends to do good, his intentions are
not suspect, but the ultimate result is always bad.</p><p>And you can see it all over the world. All the parents are trying to
do good for their children, and they are all destroying them too. Their
intentions are good, but they are miserable people; they are blind. They
have not lived their life in a celebration. Their very vibe is
poisonous, so what can good intentions do? That poison will ride upon
their good intentions. Their good intentions will never be fulfilled;
just the opposite will be the result. The politicians, the priests, are
all full of good intentions but the outcome is this chaos in the whole
world.</p><p>My insistence is: first, drop your misery -- and it can be dropped,
just like that. It is only a question of not choosing it. It is your
choice. You can decide not to be miserable, and then nothing can affect
you. You can decide to be blissful. Try tomorrow (laughter). From the
very morning decide to be blissful, and see whether what I am saying is
possible or not.</p><p>Sometimes the old habits may come in; then immediately remind
yourself that today you have decided to be blissful. Follow the
decision. And if you can do it for one day, you can do it for your whole
life.</p><p>In fact, if a person can be blissful for a single moment, he knows
the art. Because you will not get two moments together; you will always
get one moment at one time -- and that much of the secret you know!</p><p>Right now you are blissful (laughter)... this is the secret -- just
don't forget it! CRIMINAL OR CHRIST</p><p>(Either way, you've got it coming to you because you're a threat to
society, Osho warns Ma Prem Amrita.)</p><p>The only thing in existence that is immortal, that defies death, is
love. The body dies, the mind dies --</p><p>everything that begins ends. Only love never dies, because it is our
very nature. It never begins, hence it cannot end. It has always been
with us; it's our very being.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>The strange thing is, the society is very much against love. It tries
in every possible way not to allow your loving nature to surface; it
represses it. And then, instead of a humanity we have only a crowd of
subhuman beings. And they are really in a mess... because they are no
more animals. Animals are in a way happy. At least they don't have the
popes to destroy their happiness, to give them commandments. to tell
them what to do and what not to do. They live spontaneously; nobody
disturbs their spontaneity.</p><p>Man is no more an animal and he is not yet a human. He has been
prevented from being human by the vested interests. They don't want him
to become animal again so in every way they punish the criminals so
nobody falls from this subhuman state. And they punish Buddhas also. It
is a strange world: they punish the criminals and they punish the
saints, the sages.</p><p>The real saints are always punished. It is significant that when
Jesus was crucified he was crucified just in between two criminals. On
that day there were three crosses; on both sides of him there was a
thief also crucified with him.</p><p>Society crucifies the person who falls below humanity because he
becomes animal-like, and the society also crucifies the person who goes
beyond subhumanity because he becomes godlike. Society is afraid of
both, society wants you to be just in the middle. But to be in the
middle is a very tense state.</p><p>One is neither here nor there -- in a limbo, torn apart, one cannot
be at ease, one cannot be at home.</p><p>Society is afraid of the criminal because he will create chaos.
Society is afraid of the Christs and Buddhas also because they will also
create chaos. In different ways they are both going to create chaos. The
animal will create chaos because he will bring violence, aggression,
destruction; and the Buddha will create chaos because he will release
the energies of love.</p><p>Of course, the chaos created by the Buddhas is beautiful because out
of that chaos all the stars are born, out of that chaos is creativity.
But the society is against both. Society is going to be against me, too,
and against my sannyasins too. So anybody who dares to be with me has to
be absolutely ready: ready to risk, ready to gamble. And that is
possible only if the relationship with me is of love.</p><p>Two types of people come to me: a few come intellectually convinced
that what I am saying is right --</p><p>their relationship with me is very fragile; they will not be able to
sacrifice or risk. Whenever things are going good they will be with me,
and when things start going bad they will not be with me. Not only that;
they can even be against me just to protect themselves.</p><p>But the real sannyasins happens not out of intellectual conviction
but out of a heartfelt longing. With the real sannyasin it is a love
affair. Then one can sacrifice everything, even life itself, because
love is far higher than life. Life is only an opportunity to achieve
love, life is only a ladder towards love. Life is mortal, love is
immortal, the mortal can be sacrificed for the immortal.</p><p>(Osho seems to pause for a split second, then adds something that
makes one look twice new sannyasin.) Remember it -- you will need it in
your life.</p><p>GIVE YOUR EGO THE BOOT</p><p>(... and become god's flute. His name, Prabhupad, means at the feet
of the lord -- surrendered, dedicated, Osho tells another new
sannyasin.)</p><p>All that we have to surrender is the ego. It is in fact rubbish, but
we don't have anything else. Everything else is god-given; only ego is
what we have created.</p><p>That which is already god-given cannot be surrendered, only that
which we have created can be surrendered.</p><p>Sannyas means surrendering the ego and relaxing, feeling at home with
existence, dropping all conflict and struggle, being in a let-go. And
then immense bliss follows, infinite benediction showers; flowers and
flowers rain, for the simple reason that you have removed the barrier.
They were already showering; it is just that your barrier was not
allowing you to have a contact, your eyes were closed. The sun rays were
knocking on the doors.</p><p>The moment you drop the ego you open your eyes, you open your doors,
and the sun comes rushing in, and the wind and the rain, and the whole
existence suddenly starts flowing through you. You become a flute, and
god starts singing beautiful songs on you.</p><p>That's how a sannyasin has to be -- a hollow bamboo flute. That's my
symbol for a sannyasin, the hollow bamboo flute.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>GRATEFUL OR GRUMPY</p><p>(The first is the attitude of the really religious person.) One of
the greatest mistakes in life is to take life for granted. It is a gift
and one should be grateful for it; one should not take it for granted.
We don't deserve it, we have not earned lt; it has simply been given to
Us.</p><p>We are not even worthy of it. And not only has life been given to us,
love has been given to us, joy has been given to us, awareness has been
given to us. Thousands of gifts are contained in the one gift of
life.</p><p>To feel grateful towards existence is to be religious. But instead of
feeling grateful people are continuously complaining. That's the only
difference between the irreligious and the religious. The irreligious
person is continually</p><p>complaining; he is grumpy. And the religious person is contented. He
is always thankful because he feels more has been given to him than he
could ever ask for.</p><p>And that is the way of the sannyasin. LOVERLESS LOVE</p><p>(Love can exist in three ways Osho begins in his address to Ma
Premal.) The first is love as a relationship. One is loving only to a
certain person, and that too at certain moments.</p><p>When the person agrees with you, is according to you, is fulfilling
your expectations, when he is just a shadow to you and you can possess
him, then you are loving.</p><p>There are a thousand and one conditions in relationships. The moment
any single condition is not fulfilled love disappears. Love turns into
hatred any moment. The same person for whom you would have died -- you
can kill him. So that is the lowest kind of love, love as
relationship.</p><p>Your name, Premal, means the second kind of love. It is not a
relationship; one is simply loving. It has nothing to do with somebody
in particular, one is loving whether one is alone or with someone. One
is loving with the trees, with the river, with the mountains. Sitting
alone in one's room one is loving. Then love is just like the fragrance
of a flower -- whether somebody is present or not does not matter.</p><p>This is transforming love from something very ordinary and animal
into something extraordinary and human. Now love becomes a quality. That
is the meaning of Premal.</p><p>There is one stage more, higher than that, but first one has to
attain this second. And the second is the most important, even more
important than the third, the highest, because once the second is there
the third is bound to follow. You need not do anything about it.</p><p>The first is love as a relationship, the second is lovingness and the
third is when one becomes love itself, so one is not even conscious that
one is loving. In the second there is consciousness a certain
self-consciousness that one is loving. That is the only flaw left. But
you cannot remove it yourself, because if you do</p><p>then again you will be there. Then more self-consciousness will
arise: 'Look how great I am -- I have removed the last flaw! Now I am
love, pure love.' But that 'I' is still there.</p><p>You cannot do anything; once you have attained to the second, you
have to wait for the third -- it comes as a gift from god. It always
comes. You deserve it because you have attained the second. Then one day
suddenly the self- consciousness disappears and only pure love is left.
Everybody will feel it; only you will not be conscious of it. And the
more you are without self- consciousness, the more others will feel
it.</p><p>So attain the second, and leave the third for god. We always have to
leave something for him to do, otherwise he will be completely
unemployed (laughter). And it won't be a good scene: god standing before
an employment office in the queue.… That won't be a good sight. We have
to leave a few things for god!</p><p>THE MELODY OF MINDLESSNESS</p><p>(That's the meaning of Omkar, Osho tells the last sannyasin.) It is
heard only when all other noise has been dropped, when the mind is
without thoughts, without desires; the heart is without feelings,
without emotions. When the mind and heart are both absolutely empty,
then suddenly you hear something which was always there but which you
had never heard; you were so preoccupied with other things.</p><p>Suddenly a great silent music is heard, a soundless sound, just a
pure feeling of well-being, as if your 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-4>Osho's books on

cells and fibres is pulsating and humming. That humming sound is called
omkar. And that has to be heard, because in hearing it one comes to know
the beauty, the grace, the benediction, the bliss of existence. In
hearing it one has heard all the scriptures. In hearing it one has heard
the Buddhas, the Christs, the Lao Tzus.</p><h3 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=going-all-the-way>Going All the Way</h3><p>Chapter #21</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part19>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

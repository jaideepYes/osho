It is for reference purposes only.]\nBELIEVING VERSUS RETRIEVING\n(Osho adds 'Satyam' to Michael's name so his full name means truth and god. The order is significant.) There have been two schools of mystics in the world: one, the first, which consists of the majority of the mystics, puts god first and truth second; the second category of mystics which is in the minority -- it is a very small minority but it consists of the greatest mystics -- puts truth first and god second.\nBoth attitudes are right, both can lead you to the ultimate goal, but my preference is for truth to be the first thing and god the second.\nBuddha, Lao Tzu, Mahavira, agree with me -- and these are the three greatest mystics ever. Mohammed, Jesus, Krishna -- they belong to the other tradition; god is first, truth is secondary. Why did Buddha, Lao Tzu and Mahavira insist on truth being the suprememost quality, There was a very significant reason and that reason has become even more significant today. After twenty-five centuries of experience it can be said that they were right, their insistence was right, because when you put god first, god becomes a belief.\nInstead of creating enquirers you create believers.\nIf you put truth first then there is no question of belief; you have to enquire, you have to explore. If god is first then the priest becomes very important -- the church, the temple, the doctrine, the scripture, the tradition. If truth is first then you as an individual are the most important, everything else becomes secondary.\nBelief can be given by others to you. Truth cannot be given, you have to discover it yourself. And the magic of discovery is so great that it should not be missed. Believing destroys all adventure. If somebody says the Himalayas are beautiful and you believe them then there is no need to go to the Himalayas. Or you can acquire an album of beautiful photographs of the Himalayas but an album, howsoever beautiful, is not the reality of the Himalayas. You will not feel that fragrance, you will not feel that coolness, you will not be overwhelmed by that mystery, those virgin peaks that silence. A picture cannot give you all that, a picture is very flat. It can only give you some idea.\nIt is just like rather than coming to India you look at the map of India. The map of India is not India, although it is useful. But it is useful only if you want to go, otherwise it is useless. And believers stop at their belief. Christians believe in a god of their own concept, Hindus believe in a god, Mohammedans believe in a god -- the whole world is full of believers yet how many people are religious? How many people have that beauty, that grace, that is bound to happen to a religious person? How many people have that vibe? It is missing. And the reason is that we have chosen something wrong, we have put god first.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nTruth should be first. Start your enquiry for what truth is and you will find god in the end, because god is the truth of existence so you cannot miss god. But when you find on your own it will liberate you. That very experience is enough to transport you to a totally different world, from time to eternity, from the visible to the invisible, from the known to the unknowable .\nSo remember your name: Satyam Michael -- truth is first, then is god. Truth is the journey, god is the realisation of it.\nLOVING THE ULTI-MATE\n(Osho hands Tantra Mridani her sannyas name with the comments) You have a simply far-out name. (laughter) This is your name: Ma Tantra Mridani. Mridani means erotic partner of the cosmic lover (much laughter). Is it not nice? (His grin is totally disarming; the group is consumed with laughter.)\nBut you can only become a partner of the cosmic lover through tantra, there is no other way. Tantra is the only method.\nTantra means the science of falling in love with existence, not with any individual in particular; falling in love without any address of any lover, falling in love with the whole, the unaddressed whole, the unnamable whole. It contains everything from the rocks to the stars. And certainly one can have a communion with the whole, far more deeper than can exist between two individuals.\nTwo individuals can come to a union only for a moment -- it is temporary, fleeting dreamlike. For one moment it is there and then it is gone. In fact before you have recognised that it is there it is no more there, Hence ordinary love brings both -- the ecstasy which is momentary, and after the ecstasy, the dark night, the despair, the agony. Both these experiences are so mixed, so deeply mixed, that people hare chosen either one or the other. Those who have chosen the first, the ecstasy part, they believe in love; and those who have chosen the other part, the agony part, they emphasise renunciation of the world. But both have come out of the experience of love. They are like two sides of the same coin.\nYou can choose one side, the other side will be hidden beneath it; you cannot discard it. So those who live in the world are always attracted by the monks living in the monasteries, in the caves. Those who are worldly are always respectful of the other -- worldly. The worldly people in a thousand and one ways are fascinated by the spiritual people. In fact only the worldly are infatuated with the spiritual people, and this you can see everywhere -- for example, in India. The country is very materialistic, the people are very worldly, clinging to small things but their respect always goes to the saints, to those who have renounced everything.\nIt looks a contradiction but it is only apparently a contradiction. Deep down it has significances the worldly person knows the momentary joy of love and then he knows the long despair that follows so he understands when the spiritual, the so-called spiritual condemns love, condemns sex, condemns the world.\nHe understands perfectly well that he is right -- it is his own experience too.\nFor centuries all over the world people have been making love in the night before they go to sleep, for the simple reason to avoid the darker part. So you reach sexual orgasm, you enjoy it for a moment, and then you fall asleep. This is a trick, a strategy, to avoid the other side of the coin. because it hurts. Reaching to such a peak and then falling to such a depth. reaching to a sunlit peak and then falling into a dark valley hurts very much. It is better to fall asleep.\nFor millions of people sex is nothing but a kind of tranquilliser. It relaxes them into a good sleep. But even if one falls into sleep one cannot absolutely avoid the despair -- it lingers, it is there. And you cannot fall asleep immediately either. Even if you are awake for a few minutes you know that you had come to a height and now it is no more there; and again there is the longing for it It becomes a vicious circle; again and again you reach the peak, again and again you fall back.\nSo when the spiritual, the so-called spiritual -- the saints, the priests, the life- condemners, the life-poisoners -- condemn your life, your ways of life, your love affairs, deep down you agree, you know they are right. And on the other side they -- the saints, the monks, the nuns -- also feel that perhaps they are missing, perhaps the worldly people are enjoying themselves. Hence their attack on world; their condemnation becomes more sharpened. That is a revenge, because they are missing even those moments.\nBy missing those moments of course you will not feel your agony so much because there will be no contrast, but the agony is there. Even if the contrast is not there, how can you feel that you are on the peak?\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\n-- you are in the dark valley. It is more comfortable in a way because you move on the same plane. The worldly person goes up and down, up and down again and again; his life is a little chaotic. The monk's life in the monastery moves in a very smooth pattern -- smooth, certainly, but without any joy. Even those small moments of ecstasy are missing. So he is angry -- angry with all those people who are enjoying themselves.\nHis anger comes out in condemnation.\nTantra is the only science ever developed which can give you an ecstasy which is not temporal, which can give you an ecstasy, an orgasmic joy, which remains for twenty-four hours a day, which becomes just like breathing or the heartbeat: it is simply there.\nIf people can live for twenty-four hours a day in despair, why can't they live for twenty-four hour, a day in ecstasy? There is no reason. If despair is possible for twenty-four hours a day then ecstasy too is possible.\nBut then one has to learn the secrets of tantra.\nThe fundamental secret is: whenever you are making love to anybody, remember, the person is only a window. Don't become too interested in the frame of the window; the person is only a window -- you are making love to the universe!\nSo don't become attached to the window. There are others windows, there are other doors, and if one is courageous enough there is no need for windows and door, one can come out in the open -- -the whole sky is available! (laughter) That's exactly the meaning of your name, making love to the stars and the sky and the clouds.\nIt will be a little crazy but it will bring immense bliss, making love to the earth, to the grass, to the trees, just being in love with everything that exists. That is becoming a partner, an erotic partner of the cosmic lover.\nSlowly slowly one dissolves into the cosmos. The secret should be remembered: never become attached to individuals; they are only small windows into the universal. Remember the universal. Thank the individual but remember the\nuniversal. Be grateful to the individual but don't become attached, don't become possessive and don't be possessed.\nIf one can avoid being possessed and being possessive then doors upon doors go on opening and one day all the walls disappear. You are suddenly under the sky. The whole existence becomes your love affair.\nTHE KNOWER OF LOVE IS GOD'S MESSENGER BOY\n(Osho is addressing Anand Gabrielle.)\nThe miserable person is a closed person. Misery makes you closed, bliss opens you up. It works both ways: if you open up you become blissful, if you are blissful you start opening. And the same is true about misery: if you are closed you are miserable, if you are miserable you are closed. God comes to both, to the closed and to the open, but the closed cannot feel it, the open feel it. God knocks on the doors of both but the closed cannot hear; he is too engrossed with himself he is too self-centred.\nThe open can hear the knock, he is not so self-centred. The more open a person, the less self-centred ho is, the less self-conscious he is. He is conscious but not self-conscious, he is centred but not self-centred.\nAnd as one becomes aware of god's presence one becomes more and more courageous in opening because so much is coming from the opening; now it becomes irresistible. The totally open person starts living as a vehicle of god -- god becomes his strength, his power. He is no more himself, he is simply a messenger of god -- that is another meaning of Gabrielle.\nBy becoming a sannyasin do only one small thing: start opening up. Open to the flowers, open to people, open to the sunsets. Don't miss any excuse; any opportunity to open up has to be used. Learn the art of removing all blocks that keep one closed. To be closed is unnecessarily remaining in hell; it is creating your own anguish.\nOnce you learn the art of being open heaven is yours, and herenow -- not tomorrow, not after death. This very moment is paradise for the open person, because god starts flowing through him. He becomes his breath, he becomes his very being. And to live in god and to let god live through you is what sannyas is all about.\nI am not giving you any religion -- Christianity, Hinduism, Mohammedanism; I am simply giving you an insight into the art of opening your windows and doors. God is neither Hindu nor Mohammedan nor Christian. When god comes to you all these things look so stupid, all these churches and mosques and temple, look so man-made, man-manufactured. They have nothing to do with god.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nTHE GIFT OF LOVE HANDLE WITH CARE\nLove is the most delicate experience in life and because it is delicate many people decide not to have anything to do with love. It has to be handled very carefully and people are not so careful; they are rough.\nThey are good at playing rough games, ego games. Ego is very rough, love is very delicate. Ego is like a rock and love is like a rose flower. People are accustomed to throwing rocks at each other; they cannot afford to love roses, they have to avoid them. But to avoid love is to avoid life, because love is the very essence of life, the very soul of it.\nSo one has to take the risk. To be in love, to be loving and ultimately to become love is the greatest risk in the world because you become so delicate that any small thing can destroy you.\nThis is one of the laws of life that if ever the lower comes in conflict with the higher the higher will be destroyed, not the lower, because the lower is rough, hard, violent.\nThose who are interested in ambition cannot afford love. They will have money, power, prestige, they can become Alexander the Great, but they will live a miserable life.\nAlexander lived a very small life, only thirty-three years, and even in those thirty-three years he suffered much. He was continuously miserable; he was\nnever happy in those thirty-three years. He was so miserable that he started drinking too much alcohol just to drown his misery. He died of alcoholism. Otherwise he was too young and there was no need, no hurry to die so quickly, but too much alcohol killed him. It is strange that a man who was so powerful, the first world conqueror... why was he miserable? He missed love.\nYou can't have both ambition and love, ego and love, aggression and love, violence and love. If you choose love you will have to drop all these things -- the ego, aggressiveness, violence, the ambitiousness, the desire to be powerful, the desire to dominate, the desire to possess. Love is so precious that you will have to pay for it with all these things. And then too it is a rose flower -- just a small stone can be thrown and it can be destroyed -- but still it is worth it.\nEven if you can know it for a single moment -- that beauty, that grace of being in love -- it is worth it It is better to be a Jesus and crucified, better to be a Socrates and poisoned, than to be an Alexander or a Napoleon or a Stalin.\nRemember this: choosing love means choosing the most delicate experience of life, which is always in danger; a small strong wind and the petals of the rose will wither away. But so what? Even if it was there for a moment in the sun dancing in the wind it was more than enough. A single moment of love is far bigger than the whole eternity of a loveless life.\nSANNYAS: THE ART OF SAGING, NOT AGING\n(Meditation is only a temporary measure, Osho reminds a new sannyasin.) Meditation is only a method, not a goal. Its work is negative. It is like digging a well. The water is already there underneath, the undercurrents are there; by digging you remove a few layers of earth, few rocks, stones, etcetera. Once they are removed the work of digging is finished, the water is available. The same is the case with meditation: meditation is a method of digging a well within yourself to remove all that the society has imposed upon you. Once that is removed and your inner life starts welling up the method is finished. One need not remain clinging to meditation for one's whole life, because it is only a method; a method has to be used and then thrown away.\nBuddha used to say it is like a boat: you cross the river and then you forget all about the boat. You don't carry it on your head for your whole life because this is the boat which took you from the other shore to this shore.\nThere are many people who never do meditation -- they are fools. Then there are many other people who do meditation but then they become obsessed with it and they continue doing it; even when the work is over it becomes a dead old habit -- they are also fools and the world consists of these fools. It is very rare to find a person who does not belong to these two categories -- maybe out of ten thousand people there is one person who uses the method when it is needed and drops it when its work is finished.\nRight now put your total energy into meditation till you feel that the mind has become silent, that you have become capable of putting your mind off or on whenever you want. The moment you have learned the 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nart of putting your mind on and off you have found the ignition key, then method is finished; it has no more value, you can forget all about it.\nFirst put your total energy into meditation but remember never to become a clinger, never to become attached to any method. One has to go on learning and unlearning so that one remains free to learn more, then to unlearn more. Life should be an eternal pilgrimage of learning and unlearning. Whatsoever is learned has to be unlearned so you are again clean, pure, again a child, again innocent.\nThis innocence has to happen each moment of your life so you never grow old. You grow up but you never grow old. You remain fresh, as fresh as dewdrops in the morning sun. That freshness is sannyas.\nNOTHING FAILS LIKE EXCESS.\n(Osho talks about three aspects of god, and in particular, that of balancing.) Brahma represents the creative force of god and Mahesh represents the destructive force of god and Vishnu represents the balancing force between creation and destruction. Of course the balancing force is of tremendous importance.\nBuddha used to call his path the middle way -- being neither on this extreme nor on that extreme but being exactly in the middle. That's what is represented by Vishnu: just being in the middle, like a tightrope walker. The whole art of the tightrope walker is just to remain in the middle, balancing, not going too far to one side, otherwise he will fall.\nSinners fall, saints fall, because both are extremes. My sannyasins have to learn to be tightrope walkers exactly in the middle, neither a sinner nor a saint. But when you are neither a sinner nor a saint you will have to be both; a little bit of each, only then can you be in the middle; neither and both, only then can you be in the middle.\nSo that has to be remembered: avoid extremes, avoid excess. And remain aware, alert, because the mind tends to go to the extreme. It is a fundamental law of inner growth that mind tends to go to the extreme. If you remain in the middle, sooner or later mind dies, because in the middle the mind cannot exist. To exist it needs the extreme; from the sinner it can become the saint, from the saint it can become the sinner but it cannot remain in the middle.\nThis is the whole art: what I am doing here is to teach you to be in the middle. Once you have learned the beauty, the joy, of being balanced, utterly balanced -- the music of it, the melody of it -- your life is trans-formed, it becomes luminous, it becomes a tremendous relaxation -- and god is found in that rest, in that relaxation.\nRAPPING WITH ROCKS\n(Friendliness is something quite different from friendship. Osho talks to Maitreyi about the meaning of her name.)\nFriendship is a relationship. You can be in that relationship with a few people. Friendliness is a quality not a relationship. It has nothing to do with anybody else, it is basically your inner quality. You can be friendly even when you are alone. You cannot be in friendship when you are alone -- the other is needed --\nbut friendliness is a kind of fragrance. A flower opens in the jungle; nobody passes by -- still it is fragrant. It does not matter whether anybody comes to know of it or not, it is its quality. Nobody may ever come to know about it, but that does not matter; it is rejoicing.\nFriendship can exist only between one man and another man or at the most between a man and an animal -- a horse,,a dog. But friendliness can exist even with a rock, with a river, with a mountain, with a cloud, with a far-away star. Friendliness is unlimited because it is not dependent on the other; absolutely your own flowering.\nSo remember, a sannyasin has to be friendly, just friendly to all that exists.

Chuang Tzu Auditorium</h3><p>Archive code: 8011115 ShortTitle: ALLWAY11 Audio:</p><p>No Video:</p><p>No</p><p>[NOTE: This is an unedited tape transcript of an unpublished darshan
diary, which has been scanned and cleaned up. It is for reference
purposes only.]</p><p>BELIEVING VERSUS RETRIEVING</p><p>(Osho adds 'Satyam' to Michael's name so his full name means truth
and god. The order is significant.) There have been two schools of
mystics in the world: one, the first, which consists of the majority of
the mystics, puts god first and truth second; the second category of
mystics which is in the minority -- it is a very small minority but it
consists of the greatest mystics -- puts truth first and god second.</p><p>Both attitudes are right, both can lead you to the ultimate goal, but
my preference is for truth to be the first thing and god the second.</p><p>Buddha, Lao Tzu, Mahavira, agree with me -- and these are the three
greatest mystics ever. Mohammed, Jesus, Krishna -- they belong to the
other tradition; god is first, truth is secondary. Why did Buddha, Lao
Tzu and Mahavira insist on truth being the suprememost quality, There
was a very significant reason and that reason has become even more
significant today. After twenty-five centuries of experience it can be
said that they were right, their insistence was right, because when you
put god first, god becomes a belief.</p><p>Instead of creating enquirers you create believers.</p><p>If you put truth first then there is no question of belief; you have
to enquire, you have to explore. If god is first then the priest becomes
very important -- the church, the temple, the doctrine, the scripture,
the tradition. If truth is first then <em>you</em> as an individual are
the most important, everything else becomes secondary.</p><p>Belief can be given by others to you. Truth cannot be given, you have
to discover it yourself. And the magic of discovery is so great that it
should not be missed. Believing destroys all adventure. If somebody says
the Himalayas are beautiful and you believe them then there is no need
to go to the Himalayas. Or you can acquire an album of beautiful
photographs of the Himalayas but an album, howsoever beautiful, is not
the reality of the Himalayas. You will not feel that fragrance, you will
not feel that coolness, you will not be overwhelmed by that mystery,
those virgin peaks that silence. A picture cannot give you all that, a
picture is very flat. It can only give you some idea.</p><p>It is just like rather than coming to India you look at the map of
India. The map of India is not India, although it is useful. But it is
useful only if you want to go, otherwise it is useless. And believers
stop at their belief. Christians believe in a god of their own concept,
Hindus believe in a god, Mohammedans believe in a god -- the whole world
is full of believers yet how many people are religious? How many people
have that beauty, that grace, that is bound to happen to a religious
person? How many people have that vibe? It is missing. And the reason is
that we have chosen something wrong, we have put god first.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>Truth should be first. Start your enquiry for what truth is and you
will find god in the end, because god is the truth of existence so you
cannot miss god. But when you find on your own it will liberate you.
That very experience is enough to transport you to a totally different
world, from time to eternity, from the visible to the invisible, from
the known to the unknowable .</p><p>So remember your name: Satyam Michael -- truth is first, then is god.
Truth is the journey, god is the realisation of it.</p><p>LOVING THE ULTI-MATE</p><p>(Osho hands Tantra Mridani her sannyas name with the comments) You
have a simply far-out name. (laughter) This is your name: Ma Tantra
Mridani. Mridani means erotic partner of the cosmic lover (much
laughter). Is it not nice? (His grin is totally disarming; the group is
consumed with laughter.)</p><p>But you can only become a partner of the cosmic lover through tantra,
there is no other way. Tantra is the only method.</p><p>Tantra means the science of falling in love with existence, not with
any individual in particular; falling in love without any address of any
lover, falling in love with the whole, the unaddressed whole, the
unnamable whole. It contains everything from the rocks to the stars. And
certainly one can have a communion with the whole, far more deeper than
can exist between two individuals.</p><p>Two individuals can come to a union only for a moment -- it is
temporary, fleeting dreamlike. For one moment it is there and then it is
gone. In fact before you have recognised that it is there it is no more
there, Hence ordinary love brings both -- the ecstasy which is
momentary, and after the ecstasy, the dark night, the despair, the
agony. Both these experiences are so mixed, so deeply mixed, that people
hare chosen either one or the other. Those who have chosen the first,
the ecstasy part, they believe in love; and those who have chosen the
other part, the agony part, they emphasise renunciation of the world.
But both have come out of the experience of love. They are like two
sides of the same coin.</p><p>You can choose one side, the other side will be hidden beneath it;
you cannot discard it. So those who live in the world are always
attracted by the monks living in the monasteries, in the caves. Those
who are worldly are always respectful of the other -- worldly. The
worldly people in a thousand and one ways are fascinated by the
spiritual people. In fact only the worldly are infatuated with the
spiritual people, and this you can see everywhere -- for example, in
India. The country is very materialistic, the people are very worldly,
clinging to small things but their respect always goes to the saints, to
those who have renounced everything.</p><p>It looks a contradiction but it is only apparently a contradiction.
Deep down it has significances the worldly person knows the momentary
joy of love and then he knows the long despair that follows so he
understands when the spiritual, the so-called spiritual condemns love,
condemns sex, condemns the world.</p><p>He understands perfectly well that he is right -- it is his own
experience too.</p><p>For centuries all over the world people have been making love in the
night before they go to sleep, for the simple reason to avoid the darker
part. So you reach sexual orgasm, you enjoy it for a moment, and then
you fall asleep. This is a trick, a strategy, to avoid the other side of
the coin. because it hurts. Reaching to such a peak and then falling to
such a depth. reaching to a sunlit peak and then falling into a dark
valley hurts very much. It is better to fall asleep.</p><p>For millions of people sex is nothing but a kind of tranquilliser. It
relaxes them into a good sleep. But even if one falls into sleep one
cannot absolutely avoid the despair -- it lingers, it is there. And you
cannot fall asleep immediately either. Even if you are awake for a few
minutes you know that you had come to a height and now it is no more
there; and again there is the longing for it It becomes a vicious
circle; again and again you reach the peak, again and again you fall
back.</p><p>So when the spiritual, the so-called spiritual -- the saints, the
priests, the life- condemners, the life-poisoners -- condemn your life,
your ways of life, your love affairs, deep down you agree, you know they
are right. And on the other side they -- the saints, the monks, the nuns
-- also feel that perhaps they are missing, perhaps the worldly people
are enjoying themselves. Hence their attack on world; their condemnation
becomes more sharpened. That is a revenge, because they are missing even
those moments.</p><p>By missing those moments of course you will not feel your agony so
much because there will be no contrast, but the agony is there. Even if
the contrast is not there, how can you feel that you are on the
peak?</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>-- you are in the dark valley. It is more comfortable in a way
because you move on the same plane. The worldly person goes up and down,
up and down again and again; his life is a little chaotic. The monk's
life in the monastery moves in a very smooth pattern -- smooth,
certainly, but without any joy. Even those small moments of ecstasy are
missing. So he is angry -- angry with all those people who are enjoying
themselves.</p><p>His anger comes out in condemnation.</p><p>Tantra is the only science ever developed which can give you an
ecstasy which is not temporal, which can give you an ecstasy, an
orgasmic joy, which remains for twenty-four hours a day, which becomes
just like breathing or the heartbeat: it is simply there.</p><p>If people can live for twenty-four hours a day in despair, why can't
they live for twenty-four hour, a day in ecstasy? There is no reason. If
despair is possible for twenty-four hours a day then ecstasy too is
possible.</p><p>But then one has to learn the secrets of tantra.</p><p>The fundamental secret is: whenever you are making love to anybody,
remember, the person is only a window. Don't become too interested in
the frame of the window; the person is only a window -- you are making
love to the universe!</p><p>So don't become attached to the window. There are others windows,
there are other doors, and if one is courageous enough there is no need
for windows and door, one can come out in the open -- -the whole sky is
available! (laughter) That's exactly the meaning of your name, making
love to the stars and the sky and the clouds.</p><p>It will be a little crazy but it will bring immense bliss, making
love to the earth, to the grass, to the trees, just being in love with
everything that exists. That is becoming a partner, an erotic partner of
the cosmic lover.</p><p>Slowly slowly one dissolves into the cosmos. The secret should be
remembered: never become attached to individuals; they are only small
windows into the universal. Remember the universal. Thank the individual
but remember the</p><p>universal. Be grateful to the individual but don't become attached,
don't become possessive and don't be possessed.</p><p>If one can avoid being possessed and being possessive then doors upon
doors go on opening and one day all the walls disappear. You are
suddenly under the sky. The whole existence becomes your love
affair.</p><p>THE KNOWER OF LOVE IS GOD'S MESSENGER BOY</p><p>(Osho is addressing Anand Gabrielle.)</p><p>The miserable person is a closed person. Misery makes you closed,
bliss opens you up. It works both ways: if you open up you become
blissful, if you are blissful you start opening. And the same is true
about misery: if you are closed you are miserable, if you are miserable
you are closed. God comes to both, to the closed and to the open, but
the closed cannot feel it, the open feel it. God knocks on the doors of
both but the closed cannot hear; he is too engrossed with himself he is
too self-centred.</p><p>The open can hear the knock, he is not so self-centred. The more open
a person, the less self-centred ho is, the less self-conscious he is. He
is conscious but not self-conscious, he is centred but not
self-centred.</p><p>And as one becomes aware of god's presence one becomes more and more
courageous in opening because so much is coming from the opening; now it
becomes irresistible. The totally open person starts living as a vehicle
of god -- god becomes his strength, his power. He is no more himself, he
is simply a messenger of god -- that is another meaning of
Gabrielle.</p><p>By becoming a sannyasin do only one small thing: start opening up.
Open to the flowers, open to people, open to the sunsets. Don't miss any
excuse; any opportunity to open up has to be used. Learn the art of
removing all blocks that keep one closed. To be closed is unnecessarily
remaining in hell; it is creating your own anguish.</p><p>Once you learn the art of being open heaven is yours, and herenow --
not tomorrow, not after death. This very moment is paradise for the open
person, because god starts flowing through him. He becomes his breath,
he becomes his very being. And to live <em>in</em> god and to let god
live through you is what sannyas is all about.</p><p>I am not giving you any religion -- Christianity, Hinduism,
Mohammedanism; I am simply giving you an insight into the art of opening
your windows and doors. God is neither Hindu nor Mohammedan nor
Christian. When god comes to you all these things look so stupid, all
these churches and mosques and temple, look so man-made,
man-manufactured. They have nothing to do with god.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>THE GIFT OF LOVE HANDLE WITH CARE</p><p>Love is the most delicate experience in life and because it is
delicate many people decide not to have anything to do with love. It has
to be handled very carefully and people are not so careful; they are
rough.</p><p>They are good at playing rough games, ego games. Ego is very rough,
love is very delicate. Ego is like a rock and love is like a rose
flower. People are accustomed to throwing rocks at each other; they
cannot afford to love roses, they have to avoid them. But to avoid love
is to avoid life, because love is the very essence of life, the very
soul of it.</p><p>So one has to take the risk. To be in love, to be loving and
ultimately to become love is the greatest risk in the world because you
become so delicate that any small thing can destroy you.</p><p>This is one of the laws of life that if ever the lower comes in
conflict with the higher the higher will be destroyed, not the lower,
because the lower is rough, hard, violent.</p><p>Those who are interested in ambition cannot afford love. They will
have money, power, prestige, they can become Alexander the Great, but
they will live a miserable life.</p><p>Alexander lived a very small life, only thirty-three years, and even
in those thirty-three years he suffered much. He was continuously
miserable; he was</p><p>never happy in those thirty-three years. He was so miserable that he
started drinking too much alcohol just to drown his misery. He died of
alcoholism. Otherwise he was too young and there was no need, no hurry
to die so quickly, but too much alcohol killed him. It is strange that a
man who was so powerful, the first world conqueror... why was he
miserable? He missed love.</p><p>You can't have both ambition and love, ego and love, aggression and
love, violence and love. If you choose love you will have to drop all
these things -- the ego, aggressiveness, violence, the ambitiousness,
the desire to be powerful, the desire to dominate, the desire to
possess. Love is so precious that you will have to pay for it with all
these things. And then too it is a rose flower -- just a small stone can
be thrown and it can be destroyed -- but still it is worth it.</p><p>Even if you can know it for a single moment -- that beauty, that
grace of being in love -- it is worth it It is better to be a Jesus
<em>and</em> crucified, better to be a Socrates and poisoned, than to be
an Alexander or a Napoleon or a Stalin.</p><p>Remember this: choosing love means choosing the most delicate
experience of life, which is always in danger; a small strong wind and
the petals of the rose will wither away. But so what? Even if it was
there for a moment in the sun dancing in the wind it was more than
enough. A single moment of love is far bigger than the whole eternity of
a loveless life.</p><p>SANNYAS: THE ART OF SAGING, NOT AGING</p><p>(Meditation is only a temporary measure, Osho reminds a new
sannyasin.) Meditation is only a method, not a goal. Its work is
negative. It is like digging a well. The water is already there
underneath, the undercurrents are there; by digging you remove a few
layers of earth, few rocks, stones, etcetera. Once they are removed the
work of digging is finished, the water is available. The same is the
case with meditation: meditation is a method of digging a well within
yourself to remove all that the society has imposed upon you. Once that
is removed and your inner life starts welling up the method is finished.
One need not remain clinging to meditation for one's whole life, because
it is only a method; a method has to be used and then thrown away.</p><p>Buddha used to say it is like a boat: you cross the river and then
you forget all about the boat. You don't carry it on your head for your
whole life because this is the boat which took you from the other shore
to this shore.</p><p>There are many people who never do meditation -- they are fools. Then
there are many other people who do meditation but then they become
obsessed with it and they continue doing it; even when the work is over
it becomes a dead old habit -- they are also fools and the world
consists of these fools. It is very rare to find a person who does not
belong to these two categories -- maybe out of ten thousand people there
is one person who uses the method when it is needed and drops it when
its work is finished.</p><p>Right now put your total energy into meditation till you feel that
the mind has become silent, that you have become capable of putting your
mind off or on whenever you want. The moment you have learned the

CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>art of putting your mind on and off you have found the ignition key,
then method is finished; it has no more value, you can forget all about
it.</p><p>First put your total energy into meditation but remember never to
become a clinger, never to become attached to any method. One has to go
on learning and unlearning so that one remains free to learn more, then
to unlearn more. Life should be an eternal pilgrimage of learning and
unlearning. Whatsoever is learned has to be unlearned so you are again
clean, pure, again a child, again innocent.</p><p>This innocence has to happen each moment of your life so you never
grow old. You grow up but you never grow old. You remain fresh, as fresh
as dewdrops in the morning sun. That freshness is sannyas.</p><p>NOTHING FAILS LIKE EXCESS.</p><p>(Osho talks about three aspects of god, and in particular, that of
balancing.) Brahma represents the creative force of god and Mahesh
represents the destructive force of god and Vishnu represents the
balancing force between creation and destruction. Of course the
balancing force is of tremendous importance.</p><p>Buddha used to call his path the middle way -- being neither on this
extreme nor on that extreme but being exactly in the middle. That's what
is represented by Vishnu: just being in the middle, like a tightrope
walker. The whole art of the tightrope walker is just to remain in the
middle, balancing, not going too far to one side, otherwise he will
fall.</p><p>Sinners fall, saints fall, because both are extremes. My sannyasins
have to learn to be tightrope walkers exactly in the middle, neither a
sinner nor a saint. But when you are neither a sinner nor a saint you
will have to be both; a little bit of each, only then can you be in the
middle; neither and both, only then can you be in the middle.</p><p>So that has to be remembered: avoid extremes, avoid excess. And
remain aware, alert, because the mind tends to go to the extreme. It is
a fundamental law of inner growth that mind tends to go to the extreme.
If you remain in the middle, sooner or later mind dies, because in the
middle the mind cannot exist. To exist it needs the extreme; from the
sinner it can become the saint, from the saint it can become the sinner
but it cannot remain in the middle.</p><p>This is the whole art: what I am doing here is to teach you to be in
the middle. Once you have learned the beauty, the joy, of being
balanced, utterly balanced -- the music of it, the melody of it -- your
life is trans-formed, it becomes luminous, it becomes a tremendous
relaxation -- and god is found in that rest, in that relaxation.</p><p>RAPPING WITH ROCKS</p><p>(Friendliness is something quite different from friendship. Osho
talks to Maitreyi about the meaning of her name.)</p><p>Friendship is a relationship. You can be in that relationship with a
few people. Friendliness is a quality not a relationship. It has nothing
to do with anybody else, it is basically your inner quality. You can be
friendly even when you are alone. You cannot be in friendship when you
are alone -- the other is needed --</p><p>but friendliness is a kind of fragrance. A flower opens in the
jungle; nobody passes by -- still it is fragrant. It does not matter
whether anybody comes to know of it or not, it is its quality. Nobody
may ever come to know about it, but that does not matter; it is
rejoicing.</p><p>Friendship can exist only between one man and another man or at the
most between a man and an animal -- a horse,,a dog. But friendliness can
exist even with a rock, with a river, with a mountain, with a cloud,
with a far-away star. Friendliness is unlimited because it is not
dependent on the other; absolutely your own flowering.</p><p>So remember, a sannyasin has to be friendly, just friendly to all
that exists. And in that friendliness vou will find all the that is
worth finding. You will find the ultimate friend through
friendliness.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-4>Osho's books on

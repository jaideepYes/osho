It is for reference purposes only.]\nPRAYER SPOKEN. COMMUNION BROKEN\n(Just learn to listen. Osho talked on the difference between meditation and prayer on the second of this month; tonight he refers to meditation as true prayer, as opposed to the prayer that can be said.) The moment you are in absolute silence all that you ever wanted to say is said without saying it, is heard without saying it.\nThere are things which cannot be said and those are the real things. Prayer consists only of those things which cannot be said, hence a spoken prayer is a false prayer. The moment you say it you have falsified it, it is no more true. It has to be just a deep profound silence. Rather than speaking to god one needs to learn how to listen to him. Prayer is not speaking but listening.\nWhat needs to be said? Words are very inadequate, and even if they were adequate then too they would be irrelevant because god knows it already. Before you come to know what your heart wants to say god knows it. God is closer to your heart than you yourself are. There are many deeper layers of your being which are not known even to yourself but before god you are utterly naked.\nPrayer means to be silent in your utter nakedness totally exposed, available, receptive. And that is the moment when your prayer reaches to god. That is the moment when communion starts happening.\nThe communion from head to head is the most superficial, hence it has a separate name, communication.\nCommunion from heart to heart is deeper, but still there is a communion which is far deeper than the heart-to-heart communion. That can only be expressed by an orgasmic union, not communion but just union. Communication is most superficial, then communion is a little deeper and then there is union.\nIn communication you use words, in communion you use feelings, emotions, and in union nothing is used: you dissolve yourself in the whole. That is the ultimate in prayer.\nBLISS IS IT\n(Pleasure, happiness and joy, only hint at it.)\nPleasure is very limited, in fact it only exists for a split moment. There are only two basic pleasures, food and sex. When you are enjoying eating something it exists only for a moment when it is on your tongue and you can taste it; the moment it goes below the throat the pleasure is gone, it is finished. It is only a question of a few little buds on your tongue. Just a little plastic surgery and you will lose all pleasure in 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:- eating.\nIn the Second World War it happened that a man had to go through an operation in which his throat, the connection between his mouth and the stomach, had to be removed. But a device was found, a small pipe was fitted in his stomach. He could pour Coca Cola into the pipe, but there was no joy, no pleasure! The man was in very great trouble, the body was nourished. Everything was perfectly\nokay, he was taking everything nourishing, but pleasure was missing. So he found a ways first he would take the Coca Cola in his mouth, rinse it around his mouth and then pour it into the pipe (much laughter)... because the taste buds are in the tongue, nowhere else. In this way ho managed both. It looks foolish, but that's what we are all doing. (laughter) Whether the pipe is outside or inside what difference does it make?\nAnd actually the case is the same with sex only for a split second when you go into a spasm... It is going a little bit berserk, it is a kind of epileptic fit, but it is relaxing! (much laughter) All the tensions disappear, one feels good. One was carrying so many tensions and anxieties, and it is like a shaking up! But there is nothing much in it.\nPleasure is very momentary and very childish. Happiness has a little depth, it has a little vastness, but for that you have to grow some taste. For example, you will have to learn the art of enjoying classical music. It is not given by biology; you have to grow a little beyond biology. Then you can enjoy music, poetry, art, literature -- there are thousands of things. Happiness is a little vaster, higher. Joy is even a little more vast and more subtle. Joy means being in a state of well- being, just feeling good with no ulterior motive, for no reason at all; feeling good just to be breathing, sitting silently, relaxing, swimming or looking at the stars.\nJoy is not focussed on objects, happiness is; joy is more free from objects. One can be joyous without any objects, one can simply be with closed eyes and joyous. But bliss is absolutely unlimited. Joy comes and goes, it is a mood. And when joy goes, in the wake comes sadness.\nBliss comes and never goes. Once it has happened there is no way to undo it; once it has happened it has happened. And it is unlimited. As far as you con see It is there. It is an ocean without any source. And that has been the goal of all true seekers, true religious people.\nI am not against pleasure, not against happiness, not against joy. I would like you to use them as stepping stones towards blissfulness.\n(Osho talks on similar lines to another sannyasin. Bliss transcends the whole pleasure-happiness-joy trinity, he says.)\nIt is something combining all three and yet something more than the total sum of all those three. And that something more is its reality.\nIt is easy to know physical pleasure -- even animals know it. It is a little difficult to know happiness but many human beings -- the painters, the poets, the musicians, the dancers -- know it. It is a little more difficult to know joy but still a few people -- children, lovers -- know about it. But bliss is known only by the Buddhas, by those who have awakened totally. And that is the goal of sannyas.\nUnless that is achieved one remains a beggar. Once it is achieved one becomes an emperor. And the conquest is such that it cannot be taken back, that it is yours forever.\n(Delving into a dictionary won't give you a clue about the nature of bliss, Osho tells Anand Apurvo.) In the dictionary you can find meanings of all kinds of words -- 'love' 'god' 'truth' -- but you will not be able to know what love is, you will not be able to know what god is, you will not be able to know what bliss is. The real meaning has to be found in existence, not in a dictionary. The dictionary is befooling many people's inner world. People just go on accumulating words, and when they become acquainted with words they think they know what it is.\nIt is like a blind man who is acquainted with the word 'light' 'rainbow' and all its colours, but what does he know about the colours, what does he know about the rainbow, what can he know about the light? They are just empty words with no content in them.\n'Bliss' is one of those words which is not known by us. It has to be known, it has to be discovered. The journey to bliss is the journey of sannyas.\nI am not much interested in god, neither am I much interested in truth, but I am absolutely interested in blissfulness, because my own experience is that the moment you become blissful god comes searching for you; you need not bother about him at all.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nWhen you are blissful truth descends in you; you have prepared the ground. To\nthe blissful person miracles start happening because he is in the right key, he is attuned; now everything is possible. The person who is blissful is entitled to miracles. There is no need to bother about all that -- that happens on its own accord -- but bliss you have to seek and search for. And one of the strangest things is that bliss is not far away from you, it is not somewhere on the moon or on Everest.\nStanding on Everest Hillary must have felt a little stupid. What was he doing there? (laughter) Just think\n-- Hillary standing there. There was nothing to do! The moment he arrived he looked all around and started descending -- there was nothing to do. There was not even enough space to pitch a tent? What can you do there?\nBliss is not far away, it is within you, hence the journey is a withinward journey. We have to find a few spaces, a few intervals, between our outer activities to turn in. Whenever there is an opportunity, whenever you have nothing to do, rejoice, because now you can turn in. Rather than rushing into some other activity or inventing some activity, or doing something just because one has to do something...\nYou can watch people on their holidays: they go on doing stupid things. For the whole week they wait for the holiday hoping that they will relax, and when the holiday is there? You can ask any wife -- she is very tired on the holiday because the husband is at home, the children are at home and they are all doing all kinds of neurotic things And the most problematic is the husband: the clock was going perfectly well -- he will open it; the car was going perfectly well and he will open it. He has to do something! He cannot sit silently, he will find excuses not to.\nWhenever you have time, any moment, relax and go in. Forget the whole world for a moment, as if it does not exist. That is one of the ancient strategies thinking that the world consists only of illusions -- it is not that it is illusory, this is just a device -- that it is made of the same stuff as dreams are made of. Thinking this is just so that you can move in; there is no need to bother about it. Forgot all about it, lot it disappears and you go into your aloneness. And it is there that you will find the source of bliss.\nOnce it is found then everything else will start happening of its own accord.\n(And it's strange but true that it takes guts not to be blue - Osho continues with the theme of bliss.) Misery is available readymade and cheap! In fact you need not go to the shops to purchase it, you can pick it up anywhere by the side of the road. And people are very generous in giving misery to you. Even without asking they will give misery to you.\nIt needs courage to reject misery, to resist the temptation to choose it when everybody else is choosing it. It needs courage to search for bliss while the whole world is living in misery because these miserable people will call you selfish. They will say that the whole world is living in misery and you are meditating?\nIs this the time to meditate? If they are right then there is never going to be time to meditate; then Buddha was selfish, Krishna was selfish, Lao Tzu was selfish -\n- because the world has always been in misery. And if one waits to meditate for the time when nobody is in misery that time is never going to come.\nIt needs courage to stand alone, because people will not like you if you are blissful. If you are miserable everybody will feel sympathy for you it is really a strange world -- and if you are blissful everybody will feel jealous of you. If you are really blissful they will destroy you; they cannot tolerate you, you cannot be forgiven. They could not forgive Jesus, they could not forgive Socrates; they have never been able to forgive blissful people -- that's why I say bliss needs courage.\nAnd my sannyasins have to be very conscious about it, that they are taking a risk by being blissful. To dance in a world of cripples is risky. They will break your legs! To talk about light in a world of blind people is dangerous. But the risk has to be taken because living in misery is not worth living at all.\nDISCIPLESHIP IS OWNING YOUR TRIP\nMan ordinarily lives in darkness. It is his own creation, it is his own responsibility; he has chosen it. But it is against his ego to accept the responsibility so he goes on throwing the responsibility on others'\nshoulders.\nAnd unless you accept the responsibility, there is no possibility of any revolution in your life. You can go on cursing the whole world, you can go on saying it is\nfate, it is karma, it is the economic structure, it is the state, it is the church. You can go on finding some causes for your misery, but that is not going to help, that is not going to change you. In fact it is a way of consoling yourself, \"What can I do? It is 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\npredetermined. Nothing is in my hands so I simply have to accept it unwillingly, in despair. But I have to tolerate it, I have to live with it.\" Then life becomes a misery.\nThe first action of a sannyasin is to take the whole responsibility on oneself: \"I am responsible.\" With that begins a new dimension: \"If I am responsible then I can change. Then I need not choose darkness, I can choose light; I need not remain unconscious, I can make an effort to be conscious.\" And in that very effort is the dawn, the morning, the beginning of the day.\nAs your consciousness starts rising above the horizon, life starts having a totally different flavor. Then it is a dance, a celebration.\nRemember, whenever you are miserable, sad, negative, in a dark hole, remember again and again: you are responsible. Howsoever it hurts, never shirk the responsibility of it because that is the root cause of misery being prolonged. It can be prolonged for centuries, for lives together. It can be cut in a single blow of a sword.\nThe moment you say, \"I am responsible,\" you have taken the sword in your hand. And if you are ready to accept that this is your responsibility, you are already getting out of it, because who wants to be miserable?\nIf you are responsible and you are creating it, you start withdrawing your energy. You no longer feed it, you no longer nourish it. You start nourishing just the opposite - and that's bliss. That is what a spiritual life should be - full of festivity.\nIt is the same earth on which Buddha has lived, Christ has lived, and on which all kinds of miserable people are living. It is the same sky, the same stars, but\npeople's choices are different.\nMan creates himself by his own choice.\nTINKER, TAILOR... SOLDIER OR SANNYASIN\n(It's our choice, Osho reminds Anand Ritama.)\nMan can either exist in conflict with existence or in harmony with existence, either as an enemy or as a friend. Existence is the same, it is neither inimical to you nor friendly; it is simply available -- the whole thing depends on you. It simply reflects you, echoes you; it is a mirror. If you are inimical you will see your own face in nature and nature will look inimical. If you are friendly you will see your own face in nature and the whole existence will look friendly.\nTo be a sannyasin means choosing to be a friend deliberately, consciously. And once you start looking at existence in love, in trust, a deep harmony starts arising with the trees, with the clouds, with the rain, with the sun, with the wind, with the stars, with people, with animals. Slowly slowly it goes on and on spreading.\nA moment comes when you are simply no more there; there is only pure harmony. Just as a river disappears into the ocean you have disappeared into the whole. That is the moment when bliss happens, and that is our deepest longing. Everybody is searching for it.\nThe secret is simples being in harmony with nature. A sannyasin is not a warrior, he is not a soldier; he is a lover.\nGLAD TO MEET YOU\n(Until you know yourself you are going to be in anguish.) And out of this basic inner darkness a thousand and one other anxieties arise. Anxieties are branches of anguish, anguish is the root,\nSocrates is right when he says, 'Know thyself'. He is giving you the key to destroy anguish so that you can go beyond it. And once anguish is destroyed all anxieties disappear because they are just branches, secondary. They don't have their own existence, they depend on anguish.\nAll psychological school, try to help you not to be anxious. They help you to get\nrid of anxieties. They are trying to do something impossible. They may be able to patch up here and there but the anxiety will assert itself from somewhere else because the anguish is not destroyed, the anguish is there. Psychology has not been able to help people to know themselves -- and unless you know yourself you cannot be yourself.\nTo know yourself is the beginning of being yourself. If you don't know and if you are not yourself you are just in a state of chaos. a mess. That is anguish.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nPsychology is not the way. Except for meditation there has never been any way and there will never be any way out of it.\nSo you have to focus your whole being, your whole energy, on meditativeness. Learn how to be silent more and more, deeper and deeper. The day you touch the point where you are absolutely aware but there is nothing to be aware of, the miracle has happened. You have reached a point of no return; then the process is irreversible. And in a single blow anguish is destroyed and all the anxieties wither away.\nMy work consists not in helping you out of your anxieties but in uprooting anguish itself.\nKNOW THAT KNOWLEDGE AIN'T KNOWING\n(The knowing that Osho referred to in his last address is 'truth' in this one.) All knowledge is borrowed. Truth is never borrowed, truth cannot be borrowed. Nobody can give it to you, nobody can take it away from you either. But knowledge can be given and taken. The universities knowledge, and the mystery schools deal in truth. But because truth cannot be given the whole methodology has to be different: it has to be discovered within you. And the first requirement is to put aside what you have taken from others. However valuable it looks to you right now it has no value at all.\nUnless it is yours it is valueless -- put it aside. First become utterly innocent like a child, knowing nothing, and from that point start searching. Then the search is very simple. But if you carry this whole load of knowledge and then you search, it is very difficult. It is going uphill and carrying a rock on your head, the very task of going uphill is difficult and then carrying a rock makes it impossible . It is swimming in the ocean and carrying a rock. Even without the rock it is difficult to reach to the other shore -- now this rock...\nI have heard that a beautiful naked woman was running in front of a madhouse and two people were chasing her. One was carrying two buckets full of sand. A person who was watching was puzzled; he asked\n'What is the matter? If you want to catch that woman -- I know that she is mad -- why is one of you carrying these two buckets full of sand?' And the person who was not carrying any sand said 'Last time he caught her, this time, this is his handicap.'\nBut this is how I see people, they are carrying so many buckets all of sand -- they will never reach truth.\nDrop these buckets!\nTruth is not as difficult as it appears. For the innocent it is very simple, for the knowledgeable it is almost impossible.\nWHAT RELIGION SEES AS ONE, SCIENCE PUTS ASUNDER\n(Again tonight Osho touches on the difference in the scientific and the religious approach.) These are two natures in man. One nature is studied by science -- the material part of man, the physiological, the biological, the chemical. That is studied by science and science thinks that's all, there is nothing more. That's why science has humiliated man very much, insulted him very much, it has taken away all glory from man. You are nothing but chemicals, hormones, matter, atoms, electrons.\nScience speaks in the language of nothing but and that is a wrong approach. Man is far more. But I can understand the difficult of scientists: they have chosen a method which gives a limitation to their whole vision. They want to measure everything and there are things which are immeasurable.\nIt is as if a deaf person tries to listen to music with his eyes. Certainly he will say there is no music; he will say 'I can see that one man is doing something but there is no music at all, this man is befooling himself and others.' He can see the sitar player but for him this man is only stretching strings and nothing is happening. If he is absolutely deaf his eyes cannot hear, he can only see -- that is his limitation.\nExactly what is happening in science is that the method they have chosen of dissecting, analysing...\nAnalysis is their method and you can analyse only matter. If you try to analyse that which is not matter it disappears. If you kill a child and you analyse it you will find everything -- bones and blood and fat and everything -- but you will not find the child at all, you will not find its soul. The soul exists only in a certain state of harmony. It expresses itself only when the child's body is functioning in a certain attunement. The moment that attunement is destroyed the soul departs.\nHence we have to learn to go beyond this ordinary nature that science studies. We have to enter another nature, the higher nature, which is not comprehensible to intellect, to analysis, to science. Love is not 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\navailable to science, beauty is not available to it, consciousness is not available to it, god is not available to it.\nBy becoming a sannyasin you are entering into a totally different world to science. Science has to be put aside. The method of science is analysis and the method of religion is synthesis.\nWe have to go on creating bigger and bigger synthesizes. And you can sees the whole three hundred years of scientific progress has led to one thing -- they went on dissecting. First they cut matter into molecules, then molecules into atoms, then atoms into electrons, neutrons and protons, and now they are trying to cut thorn up. They will go on cutting.\nReligion approaches things totally differently it goes on adding up. Ultimately it says the whole existence is one, it is an organic unity. Science and religion move in opposite directions. And sannyas is basically the search for the ultimate unity, because only with the unity can we be blissful and be eternal and be deathless.\nSo go beyond the ordinary nature that is part of you and find within you something which transcends ordinary nature, that is there. Just the right approach, the right method, the right vision, and suddenly it is yours. And that is your true reality, that is your very being.\nTo discover it is the whole purpose of life. LOVING IS GIVING NOT GRABBING\nLove is the path and love is also the goal, the beginning and the end, the first step and the last step. Love contains the whole of religion, but love has to be understood: it is not lust. It is not a desire to get something from anybody, on the contrary it is an overflowing joy, it is sharing.\nLove is an art. It is the ultimate in aesthetics, it is creativity. When you love you want to enrich the world a little bit, you would like to leave it a little better than you found it. Only lovers can be creators.\nThose who don't know how to love are bound to be destructive in some way or other. It is the same energy that becomes creation; if it does not become creative it becomes poisonous, turns to its opposite, becomes destructive.\nAdolf Hitler wanted first to be a painter then an architect, but because ho was refused permission, he was not allowed in the art academy, his whole energy turned into destructiveness. My feeling is that he would have been a great artists he had the energy but the whole energy became insane, he became angry.\nLove means that you are grateful to existence for giving birth to you and out of that gratefulness you would like to do something for existence. Love is prayer, it is thankfulness. And slowly slowly as you start moving higher into the world of love new dimensions start opening up in you. A moment comes when love is no more a relationship, you are simply loving. And ultimately the final, the last stage is when you are not even loving, you are simply love.\nThat is the state of Buddhahood or Christ consciousness -- and that is where I am\ntrying to lead my people, slowly, slowly. Of course they have to begin their journey in a dark valley, but if you can keep your eyes on the sunlit peak there is hope; there is no need to be in despair.\nGoing All the Way Chapter #6\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"4496","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/going_all_the_way/part5/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/going_all_the_way/>Going All The Way</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>22 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;4496 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Going_All_The_Way/part5.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part4>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

meditation and prayer on the second of this month; tonight he refers to
meditation as true prayer, as opposed to the prayer that can be said.)
The moment you are in absolute silence all that you ever wanted to say
is said without saying it, is heard without saying it.</p><p>There are things which cannot be said and those are the real things.
Prayer consists only of those things which cannot be said, hence a
spoken prayer is a false prayer. The moment you say it you have
falsified it, it is no more true. It has to be just a deep profound
silence. Rather than speaking to god one needs to learn how to listen to
him. Prayer is not speaking but listening.</p><p>What needs to be said? Words are very inadequate, and even if they
were adequate then too they would be irrelevant because god knows it
already. Before you come to know what your heart wants to say god knows
it. God is closer to your heart than you yourself are. There are many
deeper layers of your being which are not known even to yourself but
before god you are utterly naked.</p><p>Prayer means to be silent in your utter nakedness totally exposed,
available, receptive. And that is the moment when your prayer reaches to
god. That is the moment when communion starts happening.</p><p>The communion from head to head is the most superficial, hence it has
a separate name, communication.</p><p>Communion from heart to heart is deeper, but still there is a
communion which is far deeper than the heart-to-heart communion. That
can only be expressed by an orgasmic union, not communion but just
union. Communication is most superficial, then communion is a little
deeper and then there is union.</p><p>In communication you use words, in communion you use feelings,
emotions, and in union nothing is used: you dissolve yourself in the
whole. That is the ultimate in prayer.</p><p>BLISS IS IT</p><p>(Pleasure, happiness and joy, only hint at it.)</p><p>Pleasure is very limited, in fact it only exists for a split moment.
There are only two basic pleasures, food and sex. When you are enjoying
eating something it exists only for a moment when it is on your tongue
and you can taste it; the moment it goes below the throat the pleasure
is gone, it is finished. It is only a question of a few little buds on
your tongue. Just a little plastic surgery and you will lose all
pleasure in 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:- eating.</p><p>In the Second World War it happened that a man had to go through an
operation in which his throat, the connection between his mouth and the
stomach, had to be removed. But a device was found, a small pipe was
fitted in his stomach. He could pour Coca Cola into the pipe, but there
was no joy, no pleasure! The man was in very great trouble, the body was
nourished. Everything was perfectly</p><p>okay, he was taking everything nourishing, but pleasure was missing.
So he found a ways first he would take the Coca Cola in his mouth, rinse
it around his mouth and then pour it into the pipe (much laughter)...
because the taste buds are in the tongue, nowhere else. In this way ho
managed both. It looks foolish, but that's what we are all doing.
(laughter) Whether the pipe is outside or inside what difference does it
make?</p><p>And actually the case is the same with sex only for a split second
when you go into a spasm... It is going a little bit berserk, it is a
kind of epileptic fit, but it is relaxing! (much laughter) All the
tensions disappear, one feels good. One was carrying so many tensions
and anxieties, and it is like a shaking up! But there is nothing much in
it.</p><p>Pleasure is very momentary and very childish. Happiness has a little
depth, it has a little vastness, but for that you have to grow some
taste. For example, you will have to learn the art of enjoying classical
music. It is not given by biology; you have to grow a little beyond
biology. Then you can enjoy music, poetry, art, literature -- there are
thousands of things. Happiness is a little vaster, higher. Joy is even a
little more vast and more subtle. Joy means being in a state of well-
being, just feeling good with no ulterior motive, for no reason at all;
feeling good just to be breathing, sitting silently, relaxing, swimming
or looking at the stars.</p><p>Joy is not focussed on objects, happiness is; joy is more free from
objects. One can be joyous without any objects, one can simply be with
closed eyes and joyous. But bliss is absolutely unlimited. Joy comes and
goes, it is a mood. And when joy goes, in the wake comes sadness.</p><p>Bliss comes and never goes. Once it has happened there is no way to
undo it; once it has happened it has happened. And it is unlimited. As
far as you con see It is there. It is an ocean without any source. And
that has been the goal of all true seekers, true religious people.</p><p>I am not against pleasure, not against happiness, not against joy. I
would like you to use them as stepping stones towards blissfulness.</p><p>(Osho talks on similar lines to another sannyasin. Bliss transcends
the whole pleasure-happiness-joy trinity, he says.)</p><p>It is something combining all three and yet something more than the
total sum of all those three. And that something more is its
reality.</p><p>It is easy to know physical pleasure -- even animals know it. It is a
little difficult to know happiness but many human beings -- the
painters, the poets, the musicians, the dancers -- know it. It is a
little more difficult to know joy but still a few people -- children,
lovers -- know about it. But bliss is known only by the Buddhas, by
those who have awakened totally. And that is the goal of sannyas.</p><p>Unless that is achieved one remains a beggar. Once it is achieved one
becomes an emperor. And the conquest is such that it cannot be taken
back, that it is yours forever.</p><p>(Delving into a dictionary won't give you a clue about the nature of
bliss, Osho tells Anand Apurvo.) In the dictionary you can find meanings
of all kinds of words -- 'love' 'god' 'truth' -- but you will not be
able to know what love is, you will not be able to know what god is, you
will not be able to know what bliss is. The real meaning has to be found
in existence, not in a dictionary. The dictionary is befooling many
people's inner world. People just go on accumulating words, and when
they become acquainted with words they think they know what it is.</p><p>It is like a blind man who is acquainted with the word 'light'
'rainbow' and all its colours, but what does he know about the colours,
what does he know about the rainbow, what can he know about the light?
They are just empty words with no content in them.</p><p>'Bliss' is one of those words which is not known by us. It has to be
known, it has to be discovered. The journey to bliss is the journey of
sannyas.</p><p>I am not much interested in god, neither am I much interested in
truth, but I am absolutely interested in blissfulness, because my own
experience is that the moment you become blissful god comes searching
for you; you need not bother about him at all.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>When you are blissful truth descends in you; you have prepared the
ground. To</p><p>the blissful person miracles start happening because he is in the
right key, he is attuned; now everything is possible. The person who is
blissful is entitled to miracles. There is no need to bother about all
that -- that happens on its own accord -- but bliss you have to seek and
search for. And one of the strangest things is that bliss is not far
away from you, it is not somewhere on the moon or on Everest.</p><p>Standing on Everest Hillary must have felt a little stupid. What was
he doing there? (laughter) Just think</p><p>-- Hillary standing there. There was nothing to do! The moment he
arrived he looked all around and started descending -- there was nothing
to do. There was not even enough space to pitch a tent? What can you do
there?</p><p>Bliss is not far away, it is within you, hence the journey is a
withinward journey. We have to find a few spaces, a few intervals,
between our outer activities to turn in. Whenever there is an
opportunity, whenever you have nothing to do, rejoice, because now you
can turn in. Rather than rushing into some other activity or inventing
some activity, or doing something just because one has to do
something...</p><p>You can watch people on their holidays: they go on doing stupid
things. For the whole week they wait for the holiday hoping that they
will relax, and when the holiday is there? You can ask any wife -- she
is very tired on the holiday because the husband is at home, the
children are at home and they are all doing all kinds of neurotic things
And the most problematic is the husband: the clock was going perfectly
well -- he will open it; the car was going perfectly well and he will
open it. He has to do <em>something</em>! He cannot sit silently, he
will find excuses not to.</p><p>Whenever you have time, any moment, relax and go in. Forget the whole
world for a moment, as if it does not exist. That is one of the ancient
strategies thinking that the world consists only of illusions -- it is
not that it is illusory, this is just a device -- that it is made of the
same stuff as dreams are made of. Thinking this is just so that you can
move in; there is no need to bother about it. Forgot all about it, lot
it disappears and you go into your aloneness. And it is there that you
will find the source of bliss.</p><p>Once it is found then everything else will start happening of its own
accord.</p><p>(And it's strange but true that it takes guts not to be blue - Osho
continues with the theme of bliss.) Misery is available readymade and
cheap! In fact you need not go to the shops to purchase it, you can pick
it up anywhere by the side of the road. And people are very generous in
giving misery to you. Even without asking they will give misery to
you.</p><p>It needs courage to reject misery, to resist the temptation to choose
it when everybody else is choosing it. It needs courage to search for
bliss while the whole world is living in misery because these miserable
people will call you selfish. They will say that the whole world is
living in misery and you are meditating?</p><p>Is this the time to meditate? If they are right then there is never
going to be time to meditate; then Buddha was selfish, Krishna was
selfish, Lao Tzu was selfish -</p><p>- because the world has always been in misery. And if one waits to
meditate for the time when nobody is in misery that time is never going
to come.</p><p>It needs courage to stand alone, because people will not like you if
you are blissful. If you are miserable everybody will feel sympathy for
you it is <em>really</em> a strange world -- and if you are blissful
everybody will feel jealous of you. If you are really blissful they will
destroy you; they cannot tolerate you, you cannot be forgiven. They
could not forgive Jesus, they could not forgive Socrates; they have
never been able to forgive blissful people -- that's why I say bliss
needs courage.</p><p>And my sannyasins have to be very conscious about it, that they are
taking a risk by being blissful. To dance in a world of cripples is
risky. They will break your legs! To talk about light in a world of
blind people is dangerous. But the risk has to be taken because living
in misery is not worth living at all.</p><p>DISCIPLESHIP IS OWNING YOUR TRIP</p><p>Man ordinarily lives in darkness. It is his own creation, it is his
own responsibility; he has chosen it. But it is against his ego to
accept the responsibility so he goes on throwing the responsibility on
others'</p><p>shoulders.</p><p>And unless you accept the responsibility, there is no possibility of
any revolution in your life. You can go on cursing the whole world, you
can go on saying it is</p><p>fate, it is karma, it is the economic structure, it is the state, it
is the church. You can go on finding some causes for your misery, but
that is not going to help, that is not going to change you. In fact it
is a way of consoling yourself, "What can I do? It is 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>predetermined. Nothing is in my hands so I simply have to accept it
unwillingly, in despair. But I have to tolerate it, I have to live with
it." Then life becomes a misery.</p><p>The first action of a sannyasin is to take the whole responsibility
on oneself: "I am responsible." With that begins a new dimension: "If I
am responsible then I can change. Then I need not choose darkness, I can
choose light; I need not remain unconscious, I can make an effort to be
conscious." And in that very effort is the dawn, the morning, the
beginning of the day.</p><p>As your consciousness starts rising above the horizon, life starts
having a totally different flavor. Then it is a dance, a
celebration.</p><p>Remember, whenever you are miserable, sad, negative, in a dark hole,
remember again and again: you are responsible. Howsoever it hurts, never
shirk the responsibility of it because that is the root cause of misery
being prolonged. It can be prolonged for centuries, for lives together.
It can be cut in a single blow of a sword.</p><p>The moment you say, "I am responsible," you have taken the sword in
your hand. And if you are ready to accept that this is your
responsibility, you are already getting out of it, because who wants to
be miserable?</p><p>If you are responsible and you are creating it, you start withdrawing
your energy. You no longer feed it, you no longer nourish it. You start
nourishing just the opposite - and that's bliss. That is what a
spiritual life should be - full of festivity.</p><p>It is the same earth on which Buddha has lived, Christ has lived, and
on which all kinds of miserable people are living. It is the same sky,
the same stars, but</p><p>people's choices are different.</p><p>Man creates himself by his own choice.</p><p>TINKER, TAILOR... SOLDIER OR SANNYASIN</p><p>(It's our choice, Osho reminds Anand Ritama.)</p><p>Man can either exist in conflict with existence or in harmony with
existence, either as an enemy or as a friend. Existence is the same, it
is neither inimical to you nor friendly; it is simply available -- the
whole thing depends on you. It simply reflects you, echoes you; it is a
mirror. If you are inimical you will see your own face in nature and
nature will look inimical. If you are friendly you will see your own
face in nature and the whole existence will look friendly.</p><p>To be a sannyasin means choosing to be a friend deliberately,
consciously. And once you start looking at existence in love, in trust,
a deep harmony starts arising with the trees, with the clouds, with the
rain, with the sun, with the wind, with the stars, with people, with
animals. Slowly slowly it goes on and on spreading.</p><p>A moment comes when you are simply no more there; there is only pure
harmony. Just as a river disappears into the ocean you have disappeared
into the whole. That is the moment when bliss happens, and that is our
deepest longing. Everybody is searching for it.</p><p>The secret is simples being in harmony with nature. A sannyasin is
not a warrior, he is not a soldier; he is a lover.</p><p>GLAD TO MEET YOU</p><p>(Until you know yourself you are going to be in anguish.) And out of
this basic inner darkness a thousand and one other anxieties arise.
Anxieties are branches of anguish, anguish is the root,</p><p>Socrates is right when he says, 'Know thyself'. He is giving you the
key to destroy anguish so that you can go beyond it. And once anguish is
destroyed all anxieties disappear because they are just branches,
secondary. They don't have their own existence, they depend on
anguish.</p><p>All psychological school, try to help you not to be anxious. They
help you to get</p><p>rid of anxieties. They are trying to do something impossible. They
may be able to patch up here and there but the anxiety will assert
itself from somewhere else because the anguish is not destroyed, the
anguish is there. Psychology has not been able to help people to know
themselves -- and unless you know yourself you cannot <em>be</em>
yourself.</p><p>To know yourself is the beginning of being yourself. If you don't
know and if you are not yourself you are just in a state of chaos. a
mess. That is anguish.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>Psychology is not the way. Except for meditation there has never been
any way and there will never be any way out of it.</p><p>So you have to focus your whole being, your whole energy, on
meditativeness. Learn how to be silent more and more, deeper and deeper.
The day you touch the point where you are absolutely aware but there is
nothing to be aware of, the miracle has happened. You have reached a
point of no return; then the process is irreversible. And in a single
blow anguish is destroyed and all the anxieties wither away.</p><p>My work consists not in helping you out of your anxieties but in
uprooting anguish itself.</p><p>KNOW THAT KNOWLEDGE AIN'T KNOWING</p><p>(The knowing that Osho referred to in his last address is 'truth' in
this one.) All knowledge is borrowed. Truth is never borrowed, truth
cannot be borrowed. Nobody can give it to you, nobody can take it away
from you either. But knowledge can be given and taken. The universities
knowledge, and the mystery schools deal in truth. But because truth
cannot be given the whole methodology has to be different: it has to be
discovered within you. And the first requirement is to put aside what
you have taken from others. However valuable it looks to you right now
it has no value at all.</p><p>Unless it is yours it is valueless -- put it aside. First become
utterly innocent like a child, knowing nothing, and from that point
start searching. Then the search is very simple. But if you carry this
whole load of knowledge and then you search, it is very difficult. It is
going uphill and carrying a rock on your head, the very task of going
uphill is difficult and then carrying a rock makes it impossible . It is
swimming in the ocean and carrying a rock. Even without the rock it is
difficult to reach to the other shore -- now this rock...</p><p>I have heard that a beautiful naked woman was running in front of a
madhouse and two people were chasing her. One was carrying two buckets
full of sand. A person who was watching was puzzled; he asked</p><p>'What is the matter? If you want to catch that woman -- I know that
she is mad -- why is one of you carrying these two buckets full of
sand?' And the person who was not carrying any sand said 'Last time he
caught her, this time, this is his handicap.'</p><p>But this is how I see people, they are carrying so many buckets all
of sand -- they will never reach truth.</p><p>Drop these buckets!</p><p>Truth is not as difficult as it appears. For the innocent it is very
simple, for the knowledgeable it is almost impossible.</p><p>WHAT RELIGION SEES AS ONE, SCIENCE PUTS ASUNDER</p><p>(Again tonight Osho touches on the difference in the scientific and
the religious approach.) These are two natures in man. One nature is
studied by science -- the material part of man, the physiological, the
biological, the chemical. That is studied by science and science thinks
that's all, there is nothing more. That's why science has humiliated man
very much, insulted him very much, it has taken away all glory from man.
You are nothing but chemicals, hormones, matter, atoms, electrons.</p><p>Science speaks in the language of nothing but and that is a wrong
approach. Man is far more. But I can understand the difficult of
scientists: they have chosen a method which gives a limitation to their
whole vision. They want to measure everything and there are things which
are immeasurable.</p><p>It is as if a deaf person tries to listen to music with his eyes.
Certainly he will say there is no music; he will say 'I can see that one
man is doing something but there is no music at all, this man is
befooling himself and others.' He can see the sitar player but for him
this man is only stretching strings and nothing is happening. If he is
absolutely deaf his eyes cannot hear, he can only see -- that is his
limitation.</p><p>Exactly what is happening in science is that the method they have
chosen of dissecting, analysing...</p><p>Analysis is their method and you can analyse only matter. If you try
to analyse that which is not matter it disappears. If you kill a child
and you analyse it you will find everything -- bones and blood and fat
and everything -- but you will not find the child at all, you will not
find its soul. The soul exists only in a certain state of harmony. It
expresses itself only when the child's body is functioning in a certain
attunement. The moment that attunement is destroyed the soul
departs.</p><p>Hence we have to learn to go beyond this ordinary nature that science
studies. We have to enter another nature, the higher nature, which is
not comprehensible to intellect, to analysis, to science. Love is not

not available to it, god is not available to it.</p><p>By becoming a sannyasin you are entering into a totally different
world to science. Science has to be put aside. The method of science is
analysis and the method of religion is synthesis.</p><p>We have to go on creating bigger and bigger synthesizes. And you can
sees the whole three hundred years of scientific progress has led to one
thing -- they went on dissecting. First they cut matter into molecules,
then molecules into atoms, then atoms into electrons, neutrons and
protons, and now they are trying to cut thorn up. They will go on
cutting.</p><p>Religion approaches things totally differently it goes on adding up.
Ultimately it says the whole existence is one, it is an organic unity.
Science and religion move in opposite directions. And sannyas is
basically the search for the ultimate unity, because only with the unity
can we be blissful and be eternal and be deathless.</p><p>So go beyond the ordinary nature that is part of you and find within
you something which transcends ordinary nature, that is there. Just the
right approach, the right method, the right vision, and suddenly it is
yours. And that is your true reality, that is your very being.</p><p>To discover it is the whole purpose of life. LOVING IS GIVING NOT
GRABBING</p><p>Love is the path and love is also the goal, the beginning and the
end, the first step and the last step. Love contains the whole of
religion, but love has to be understood: it is not lust. It is not a
desire to get something from anybody, on the contrary it is an
overflowing joy, it is sharing.</p><p>Love is an art. It is the ultimate in aesthetics, it is creativity.
When you love you want to enrich the world a little bit, you would like
to leave it a little better than you found it. Only lovers can be
creators.</p><p>Those who don't know how to love are bound to be destructive in some
way or other. It is the same energy that becomes creation; if it does
not become creative it becomes poisonous, turns to its opposite, becomes
destructive.</p><p>Adolf Hitler wanted first to be a painter then an architect, but
because ho was refused permission, he was not allowed in the art
academy, his whole energy turned into destructiveness. My feeling is
that he would have been a great artists he <em>had</em> the energy but
the whole energy became insane, he became angry.</p><p>Love means that you are grateful to existence for giving birth to you
and out of that gratefulness you would like to do something for
existence. Love is prayer, it is thankfulness. And slowly slowly as you
start moving higher into the world of love new dimensions start opening
up in you. A moment comes when love is no more a relationship, you are

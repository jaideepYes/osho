It is for reference purposes only.]\nPRAIRIE OR PARADISE\nMan is born with a great potential to flower, he is born to become a garden, an oasis. But what really happens is very unfortunate: ninety-nine point nine per cent of people remain just deserts And the simple reason is that we never think of life as an opportunity to grow; we take it for granted, we accept it as if it is already complete. We think of it as a thing -- and it is a process -- it is not a thing. It begins in birth but it does not end anywhere; it goes on and on, even beyond death.\nA sannyasin has to think of life as an opportunity, as a process, as a potential, as a challenge for growth.\nAnd then bliss is yours. Once you start consciously thinking in these terms you enter into a different dimension; the desert is transformed into a garden. And to be a garden is to be in paradise. That is exactly the meaning of the word 'paradise'. It comes from the Persian, 'firdaus' -- -firdaus means a garden.\nCELEBRATE AND YE WILL FIND\nMy sannyasins have to be like flowers. Just as the sword represents violence and war, the flower represents love and peace. My sannyasins are really flower people! We are not fighting with anybody we are not integrated in any fight -- we are not at all concerned with any religious crusade. We are not Jehovah's witnesses, we are not Christians, neither Mohammedans nor Hindus -- they have always been warring, fighting. We just want to be left alone so that we can do our own thing, so that we can just be ourselves.\nThe flower simply represents love, silence -- peace, joy, festivity -- colourfulness\n-- and that's how my sannyasins have to be. They have to be a totally new kind of religious person, not like those old, dull saints\n-- not sober and very serious and doing something holy. My sannyasins have to live like nobodies -- because whenever you try to live like somebody there is bound to be fight because it is a power struggle, it is an ego trip. Love the world in its absolute ordinariness. There is no need for another world -- this is more than enough. This is too beautiful, it cannot be improved upon -- enjoy it! And in enjoying it you will find god.\nThe old religions were telling people to renounce life. I say rejoice in life because god is life; if you rejoice only then will you find him.\nHAPPINESS IS AT HOME-NESS\nA man without bliss is a man without a home. He may have a house but he cannot have a home. And the man who is blissful may not have any house but he will have a home -- in fact wherever he is he will be at home.\nThe miserable person is always in a state of tension everywhere. He feels an outsider, a stranger, he cannot relate with existence -- he cannot relate with himself. He cannot see any meaning in life. He feels like driftwood -- accidental, and how can one really live if that feeling of being accidental persists? Then 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\none can only somehow vegetate -- and that is not life; just somehow carrying on is not being alive.\nUnless there is dance there is no life, unless there is celebration there is no life. My religion consists of blissfulness, love, poetry, music, dance, celebration. And once you have found the art of being blissful you have found the ultimate home. Then you are no more accidental,,then your life becomes part of this immense universe, its beauty, its glory, its splendour. Then the flowers are yours and the stars too.\nAnd to be blissful is not difficult; we just have to be consciously at work for it. It is an art to be learned.\nI call it meditation -- -that is just a name for the whole science of blissfulness. SANNYAS: EGO ALTAR\n(Osho explains the meaning of Arpana Donatella.) Arpana means surrender, offering oneself to god.\nAny offering is pointless unless you offer yourself. One can offer money, but that is not a true offering, because everybody comes empty-handed so whatsoever you possess does not in fact belong to you. You came empty-handed and you will go empty-handed. The only thing that can be given to god is your own being -- that's all that one possesses.\nAnd Donatella means a small gift. Of course one is a small gift for god, but a gift is a gift; no gift is small in that sense. Its being a gift is enough, it is always infinite.\nFrom the side of the giver it may be a small gift but from the side of the receiver it is immense. So we give small gifts to god but god receives an infinity. We don't love anything. What have we got? -- just a little love, a little candlelight --\nbut in offering it, it becomes big.\nIf you offer yourself totally a new experience happens: by giving yourself you become empty , and in that emptiness god starts pouring his gifts. We give nothing but we get everything.\nAnd sannyas is exactly an offering of your being to god. So your name precisely defines sannyas.\nSTILL THE MIND: BLISS, THE WINE\nMeditation is a process of stilling the mind, of settling it. Ordinarily it is a chaos. Transforming the chaos into a cosmos, that's what meditation is all about. Ordinarily it is just noise. Changing that noise into music, creating a hidden harmony in it, that's what meditation is. When the mind is quiet, silent, harmonious, naturally great joy comes. That is the meaning of Barbara: coming with joy.\nOnly the meditator knows the infinite blissfulness of existence, the tremendous benediction of it all. All others simply go on missing the point. So by becoming a sannyasin meditation becomes your very target.\nEverything has to be staked for it, everything has to be risked for it. Nothing is more important and nothing is higher. Meditation becomes your central theme of existence, and then more and more joy starts happening. And there is no end to it, it is an infinite process. There is a beginning but no end.\n(And on a similar theme Osho talks to Dhyano Luis.)\nIt is only through meditation that one -- aware of the glory of existence. Meditation is a bridge. Without meditation you are disconnected from existence. You are there, the existence is there, but there is no bridge; you are on this side of the river and the existence is on that side of it. You can see it but you cannot touch it, you can see it but you cannot feel it. It is there, just like a dream, but -- not a reality. It becomes a reality only when the bridge is made.\nWhen you become capable of moving between these two shores -- between this world and that --\nbetween and thou, between the inner and the outer, between the visible and the\ninvisible, then you know how much beauty is contained in every moment and how much bliss can be released. There is no need for anybody to be poor. Existence has so much to give that everybody can be an emperor -- there is no need even for competition.\nEMPERORS OF ETCETERA 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nMy observation is that the miserable person becomes mean, cunning, untrusting, dishonest, insincere, inauthentic. Simply because he is miserable he is angry at existence, he wants to take revenge. We cannot have a noble character, he cannot have nobleness around him. Nobleness is a by-product of gratitude and he has nothing to be grateful for. He is just a complaint, a wound, and how can the wound give fragrance? -- it can only stink.\nOnly the blissful person is noble. Nobility has nothing to do with birth, it has something to do with the art of living. Certainly one can become an aristocrat if one knows how to live. One may not possess anything but still one will live like a king because kingliness has nothing to do with possessions; it has something to do with how you approach life. Is it with complaint or with gratitude? And one can be grateful only if one is blissful because then one feels that existence has given one so much, how can one repay it?\nThere is no way to repay it -- hence gratitude arises. If there were a way to repay there would be no need to be grateful. But there are things which cannot be repaid -- then the only possible way is to feel thankful. In that thankfulness, meanness, deceptiveness, cunningness, all disappear; one becomes simply innocent, trusting.\nAnd the moment you trust existence you start feeling the presence of god. God is not a belief. It is trusting existence that makes you feel the presence of god -- it is an experience. But everything begins in blissfulness.\nSo my sannyasins have to start their journey with laughter, with joy, with dance. EGO: I-LAND\nMan can live either as an island, isolated from existence, thinking himself separate, as an ego, but then there is misery. Then misery is absolutely certain, because we are going against existence.\nYou cannot be blissful if you are going against existence. You are fighting a losing battle. It is like trying to swim upstream: you may succeed a little bit but sooner or later you will be exhausted, tired -- and then the river will take you. And because now you are defeated this river taking you away will look like an enemy. It is just your idea that has created the bhole problem. The river is not fighting with you, it has not defeated you; you tried to fight with it and you got defeated. The river is not responsible at all. If you had taken a different approach, if from the very beginning you accepted going with the river, there would have been no defeat, no frustration. You would not have felt that existence has been against you; you would have rejoiced. Going with the river, dancing with the river, you would have felt the river giving you strength.\nThat is the way of the religious person.\nThe first -- the way of the ego -- is the way of the irreligious. The second -- the way of let-go -- merging and melting into existence -- that is the way of the religious person. And the moment you melt and merge with existence god becomes your strength and there is great rejoicing in the heart. Each moment is a moment of victory and without any fight, without any struggle. That's the miracle of being religious.\nCHOOSE AND YOU LOSE\n(Indradhanu means rainbow. Osho tells another sannyasin about the significance of her new name.) The rainbow is symbolic of multi-dimensionality. It has the whole spectrum of colours. Religious people in the past have lived a one -- dimensional life -- and when you choose to live one -- dimensionally you become unnecessarily poor, you cannot be rich.\nRichness means multi-dimensionality. Richness means ring life in its totality, not choosing but living it in all its colours, in all its shades -- in all its possibilities. The more windows you have to your house -- the richer your house will be\nbecause one window will open to the East and you will see the sunrise -- and another window will open to the West and you will see the sunset. ,The sunrise has its beauty and the sunset has its own beauty, and they are incomparable. There is no question of choice -- the chooser will be a loser.\nIf he chooses the sunset he loses the beauty of the sunrise, or vice versa. Life should be lived in as many ways as possible.\nOne should love poetry, music, painting. One should try to reach beauty, truth, goodness, from all directions. There is no need to become a simple line, one should be a rainbow.\nMy first idea for my sannyasins' robe was the colour of the rainbow, but that would have been too 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\npsychedelic. And I am already so notorious that thought it better not, it would be too much. (laughter) Otherwise that was my first idea!\nTHE REAL SWINGER IS A NON-CLINGER\n(Samira means breeze, and it represents many qualities that a sannyasin should imbibe.) One is -- it comes like a whisper. It does not make noise, it does not make proclamations; it comes very silently, you cannot hear it -- suddenly it is there. And that's how god comes -- truth comes -- bliss comes, love comes -- they all come in a whisper-like manner, not with trumpets and drums. They suddenly come without even making any appointment, without even asking you 'May I come in, sir?' -- they just suddenly come. And that's how the breeze comes: one moment it is not there, another moment it is there.\nAnd the second thing: just as it comes, it goes; you cannot hold to it, you cannot cling to it. There is no possible way. Enjoy it while it is there and when it goes, let it go. Be thankful that it came. Don't feel any grudge, don't feel any complaint. When it goes it goes -- nothing can be done about it. But we are all clingers. When love comes we are very happy but when it goes we are very hurt.\nThat is being very unconscious -- ungrateful -- misunderstanding.\nRemember, it comes one way,,now it is going the same way. It did not ask... why should it ask now if it can go. It was a gift from the beyond -- mysterious, and it has to go in the same mysterious way.\nIf one takes life like a breeze then there is no clinging, no attachment -- no obsession -- one simply remains available aud whatsoever happens is good.\nFor example, right now there is no breeze at all. It has its own beauty. Not even a leaf is moving, the trees are standing like Buddhas. This is its own beauty and its own dimension, its own richness. Then the breeze will come and the Buddhas will become dervishes -- whirling Sufis -- and the trees will dance and sing. And when the breeze has gone again they will be Buddhas.\nThis is how one should be, particularly how my sannyasins should be -- capable of both. Life brings many things and one never knows what more is going to come. So never cling, because if you cling your hands will be full and you may miss the next gift.\nOnce George Bernard Shaw was asked -- What do you say about making love in the morning? -- He said\n-- I am against it... because one never knows who one is going to meet in the afternoon! -- That's right.\n(much laughter)... one never knows! It is better to wait!\nLife goes on giving new things. Never cling,,never remain obsessed with any experience. Be open, certainly, the doors should not be kept closed, so when the wind comes, good, when the sun comes, good, when the moon comes, good, when the rain comes, good. When nothing comes that too is perfectly good, a peaceful moment, nothing is coming, a restful moment to relax.\nRest is good, dance is good. One just needs a little bit of understanding, then the whole of life is good.\nHow long will you be here? -- That's good! (much laughter) Going All the Way\nChapter #17\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2728","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/going_all_the_way/part16/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/going_all_the_way/>Going All The Way</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>13 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2728 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Going_All_The_Way/part16.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part15>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

accidental,,then your life becomes part of this immense universe, its
beauty, its glory, its splendour. Then the flowers are yours and the
stars too.</p><p>And to be blissful is not difficult; we just have to be consciously
at work for it. It is an art to be learned.</p><p>I call it meditation -- -that is just a name for the whole science of
blissfulness. SANNYAS: EGO ALTAR</p><p>(Osho explains the meaning of Arpana Donatella.) Arpana means
surrender, offering oneself to god.</p><p>Any offering is pointless unless you offer yourself. One can offer
money, but that is not a true offering, because everybody comes
empty-handed so whatsoever you possess does not in fact belong to you.
You came empty-handed and you will go empty-handed. The only thing that
can be given to god is your own being -- that's all that one
possesses.</p><p>And Donatella means a small gift. Of course one is a small gift for
god, but a gift is a gift; no gift is small in that sense. Its being a
gift is enough, it is always infinite.</p><p>From the side of the giver it may be a small gift but from the side
of the receiver it is immense. So we give small gifts to god but god
receives an infinity. We don't love anything. What have we got? -- just
a little love, a little candlelight --</p><p>but in offering it, it becomes big.</p><p>If you offer yourself totally a new experience happens: by giving
yourself you become empty , and in that emptiness god starts pouring
<em>his</em> gifts. We give nothing but we get everything.</p><p>And sannyas is exactly an offering of your being to god. So your name
precisely defines sannyas.</p><p>STILL THE MIND: BLISS, THE WINE</p><p>Meditation is a process of stilling the mind, of settling it.
Ordinarily it is a chaos. Transforming the chaos into a cosmos, that's
what meditation is all about. Ordinarily it is just noise. Changing that
noise into music, creating a hidden harmony in it, that's what
meditation is. When the mind is quiet, silent, harmonious, naturally
great joy comes. That is the meaning of Barbara: coming with joy.</p><p>Only the meditator knows the infinite blissfulness of existence, the
tremendous benediction of it all. All others simply go on missing the
point. So by becoming a sannyasin meditation becomes your very
target.</p><p>Everything has to be staked for it, everything has to be risked for
it. Nothing is more important and nothing is higher. Meditation becomes
your central theme of existence, and then more and more joy starts
happening. And there is no end to it, it is an infinite process. There
is a beginning but no end.</p><p>(And on a similar theme Osho talks to Dhyano Luis.)</p><p>It is only through meditation that one -- aware of the glory of
existence. Meditation is a bridge. Without meditation you are
disconnected from existence. You are there, the existence is there, but
there is no bridge; you are on this side of the river and the existence
is on that side of it. You can see it but you cannot touch it, you can
see it but you cannot feel it. It is there, just like a dream, but --
not a reality. It becomes a reality only when the bridge is made.</p><p>When you become capable of moving between these two shores -- between
this world and that --</p><p>between and thou, between the inner and the outer, between the
visible and the</p><p>invisible, then you know how much beauty is contained in every moment
and how much bliss can be released. There is no need for anybody to be
poor. Existence has so much to give that everybody can be an emperor --
there is no need even for competition.</p><p>EMPERORS OF ETCETERA 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>My observation is that the miserable person becomes mean, cunning,
untrusting, dishonest, insincere, inauthentic. Simply because he is
miserable he is angry at existence, he wants to take revenge. We cannot
have a noble character, he cannot have nobleness around him. Nobleness
is a by-product of gratitude and he has nothing to be grateful for. He
is just a complaint, a wound, and how can the wound give fragrance? --
it can only stink.</p><p>Only the blissful person is noble. Nobility has nothing to do with
birth, it has something to do with the art of living. Certainly one can
become an aristocrat if one knows how to live. One may not possess
anything but still one will live like a king because kingliness has
nothing to do with possessions; it has something to do with how you
approach life. Is it with complaint or with gratitude? And one can be
grateful only if one is blissful because then one feels that existence
has given one so much, how can one repay it?</p><p>There is no way to repay it -- hence gratitude arises. If there were
a way to repay there would be no need to be grateful. But there are
things which cannot be repaid -- then the only possible way is to feel
thankful. In that thankfulness, meanness, deceptiveness, cunningness,
all disappear; one becomes simply innocent, trusting.</p><p>And the moment you trust existence you start feeling the presence of
god. God is not a belief. It is trusting existence that makes you feel
the presence of god -- it is an experience. But everything begins in
blissfulness.</p><p>So my sannyasins have to start their journey with laughter, with joy,
with dance. EGO: I-LAND</p><p>Man can live either as an island, isolated from existence, thinking
himself separate, as an ego, but then there is misery. Then misery is
absolutely certain, because we are going against existence.</p><p>You cannot be blissful if you are going against existence. You are
fighting a losing battle. It is like trying to swim upstream: you may
succeed a little bit but sooner or later you will be exhausted, tired --
and then the river will take you. And because now you are defeated this
river taking you away will look like an enemy. It is just your idea that
has created the bhole problem. The river is not fighting with you, it
has not defeated you; you tried to fight with it and you got defeated.
The river is not responsible at all. If you had taken a different
approach, if from the very beginning you accepted going with the river,
there would have been no defeat, no frustration. You would not have felt
that existence has been against you; you would have rejoiced. Going with
the river, dancing with the river, you would have felt the river giving
you strength.</p><p>That is the way of the religious person.</p><p>The first -- the way of the ego -- is the way of the irreligious. The
second -- the way of let-go -- merging and melting into existence --
that is the way of the religious person. And the moment you melt and
merge with existence god becomes your strength and there is great
rejoicing in the heart. Each moment is a moment of victory and without
any fight, without any struggle. That's the miracle of being
religious.</p><p>CHOOSE AND YOU LOSE</p><p>(Indradhanu means rainbow. Osho tells another sannyasin about the
significance of her new name.) The rainbow is symbolic of
multi-dimensionality. It has the whole spectrum of colours. Religious
people in the past have lived a one -- dimensional life -- and when you
choose to live one -- dimensionally you become unnecessarily poor, you
cannot be rich.</p><p>Richness means multi-dimensionality. Richness means ring life in its
totality, not choosing but living it in all its colours, in all its
shades -- in all its possibilities. The more windows you have to your
house -- the richer your house will be</p><p>because one window will open to the East and you will see the sunrise
-- and another window will open to the West and you will see the sunset.
,The sunrise has its beauty and the sunset has its own beauty, and they
are incomparable. There is no question of choice -- the chooser will be
a loser.</p><p>If he chooses the sunset he loses the beauty of the sunrise, or vice
versa. Life should be lived in as many ways as possible.</p><p>One should love poetry, music, painting. One should try to reach
beauty, truth, goodness, from all directions. There is no need to become
a simple line, one should be a rainbow.</p><p>My first idea for my sannyasins' robe was the colour of the rainbow,
but that would have been too 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on

not, it would be too much. (laughter) Otherwise that was my first
idea!</p><p>THE REAL SWINGER IS A NON-CLINGER</p><p>(Samira means breeze, and it represents many qualities that a
sannyasin should imbibe.) One is -- it comes like a whisper. It does not
make noise, it does not make proclamations; it comes very silently, you
cannot hear it -- suddenly it is there. And that's how god comes --
truth comes -- bliss comes, love comes -- they all come in a
whisper-like manner, not with trumpets and drums. They suddenly come
without even making any appointment, without even asking you 'May I come
in, sir?' -- they just suddenly come. And that's how the breeze comes:
one moment it is not there, another moment it is there.</p><p>And the second thing: just as it comes, it goes; you cannot hold to
it, you cannot cling to it. There is no possible way. Enjoy it while it
is there and when it goes, let it go. Be thankful that it came. Don't
feel any grudge, don't feel any complaint. When it goes it goes --
nothing can be done about it. But we are all clingers. When love comes
we are very happy but when it goes we are very hurt.</p><p>That is being very unconscious -- ungrateful -- misunderstanding.</p><p>Remember, it comes one way,,now it is going the same way. It did not
ask... why should it ask now if it can go. It was a gift from the beyond
-- mysterious, and it has to go in the same mysterious way.</p><p>If one takes life like a breeze then there is no clinging, no
attachment -- no obsession -- one simply remains available aud
whatsoever happens is good.</p><p>For example, right now there is no breeze at all. It has its own
beauty. Not even a leaf is moving, the trees are standing like Buddhas.
This is its own beauty and its own dimension, its own richness. Then the
breeze will come and the Buddhas will become dervishes -- whirling Sufis
-- and the trees will dance and sing. And when the breeze has gone again
they will be Buddhas.</p><p>This is how one should be, particularly how my sannyasins should be
-- capable of both. Life brings many things and one never knows what
more is going to come. So never cling, because if you cling your hands
will be full and you may miss the next gift.</p><p>Once George Bernard Shaw was asked -- What do you say about making
love in the morning? -- He said</p><p>-- I am against it... because one never knows who one is going to
meet in the afternoon! -- That's right.</p><p>(much laughter)... one never knows! It is better to wait!</p><p>Life goes on giving new things. Never cling,,never remain obsessed
with any experience. Be open, certainly, the doors should not be kept
closed, so when the wind comes, good, when the sun comes, good, when the
moon comes, good, when the rain comes, good. When nothing comes that too
is perfectly good, a peaceful moment, nothing is coming, a restful
moment to relax.</p><p>Rest is good, dance is good. One just needs a little bit of
understanding, then the whole of life is good.</p><p>How long will you be here? -- That's good! (much laughter)

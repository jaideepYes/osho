It is for reference purposes only.]\nMIND GONE, CONSCIOUSNESS BORN\n(Meditation is a second birth, the birth of one's spirit. Osho tells Dhyano Ursula.) The first birth is only physical. It is ordinary; it happens to animals, to trees, to insects, it happens to everybody. It is a natural phenomenon.\nMeditation is a second birth. It happens only when you deliberately and consciously take part in it. In that way it is not natural. it is transcendental to nature. And it is only meditation that makes a man a man.\notherwise he is just an animal. Without meditation there is no distinction between man and animal. Maybe 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nthere are some differences of quantity -- a little more intelligence, a little more\ncunning, a little more alertness -- but those are not qualitative differences, only quantitative.\nMeditation gives you a qualitative distinction -- and that is the meaning of Ursula: of distinguished quality.\nWithout meditation man has no distinction. With meditation his whole life goes through a radical change; from horizontal he becomes vertical, from moving in time he starts moving in eternity. Eternity is vertical, time is horizontal; hence time can be divided into past, present, future. It is a line: the art of the line that has gone is the past, the part of the line that is in front of you is the present, and the part of the line that is going to be in front of you is the future. But eternity is indivisible, it is only now. There is no past, no future; it is only present.\nHence meditation is an art of living here and now, of getting out of the past and of the future. Those two are the basic pillars of the mind. Once those pillars are removed the mind collapses and in the death of the mind is your birth, the second birth. And once you know your eternity there is great joy, there is great understanding, gratitude, prayer. All that is valuable starts flowering in you. Life becomes a living fragrance.\nIN THE THICK OF THE WORLD AND_THE THIN OF THE IN\n(One has to learn to move freely between the two.)\nMan has completely forgotten the inner dimension, he has become obsessed with the outer. He goes on and on changing toys, more money, more power, more prestige. These are all toys. You can play with them but meanwhile you are wasting precious time. They can keep you occupied but they will also keep you in deep anguish, in tension, in anxiety, for the simple reason that the world outside is a world of competition, it is struggle. You are not alone there; millions and millions of people are searching for the same things.\nAll are after money, so everybody is at each other's throat. It is a violent struggle, a war -- sometimes in the open, sometimes underground. Life on the outside remains feverish; it is a kind of delirium, an insanity.\nThere is no rest, no peace, no bliss, no relaxation, unless one enters inside, then one enters a totally different world. There you are alone. There is no question of conflict, there is nobody to fight anybody, no question of competition. There is\nnothing to achieve, nothing to lose, nothing to gain; a great calmness descends upon you. That is the meaning of Sauro; Sauro means in the shade.\nTo be outside yourself is to be under the hot sun, it is to be continuously under fire. To be in is to be in the shade -- cool, calm, collected.\nMy sannyasins have to learn the whole art of being available to both worlds. I am not against the outside world, I am only against its insanity; and that insanity can be balanced by inner sanity, then there is no problem. If you can keep cool under the hot sun there is no problem. If you can keep cool in the tumult and noise of life there is no problem. If you can remain relaxed in the marketplace there is no need to go anywhere. So you have to learn the art of moving in and out easily, just as you move outside and inside your house -- there is no problem in it.\nBut for centuries we have been told that you can either be an extrovert or an introvert -- and not only the old traditions say so; even one of the most important psychologists of this age, Carl Gustav Jung repeats the same thing -- either-or, either you are an extrovert or you are an introvert. Nobody has recognized even the possibility of being flexible. When there is time to go out, go out, when there is time to come in, come in, and let them balance each other. This balancing is my sannyas.\nMy sannyas cannot be categorized by Carl Gustav Jung, my sannyasin will defy his categorization. Jung cannot call him introvert because he loves, relates, creates -- he is in the thick of the world. He enjoys both worlds. When you can have both worlds why choose one? That is foolish! But for centuries man has chosen one.\nThere was a reason: to choose one is simple, you avoid complexity. But complexity has its own beauty.\nIt is simple to grow only roses in your garden, you will become a great expert in growing roses, but your garden will not look like a garden. It needs all the colors, all the flowers, all the fragrances. Your roses cannot replace the nightqueen -- there is no way, no rose can do that. Your roses cannot become the sunflowers -- they cannot move with the sun, they are not sun-worshippers. Your roses are beautiful but they are beautiful only in the whole orchestra of the garden, otherwise they are boring. Even the most 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nbeautiful thing can become boring, and it is simple; you simply learn one art. To know all the flowers, their seasons, their seeds, the manure they need creates complexity.\nHence for centuries man has chosen only one world: either being an introvert then moving into a monastery, becoming a monk or a nun and living the life of a closed existence -- no windows, no doors to the outside world... Yes, it will be a very simple existence but there will be no song in it. It will be dull and flat. It will be like a person continuously playing a single note on the guitar.\nI have heard: Mulla Nasruddin was learning the guitar. He would just go on playing a single note again and again, day in, day out. He was driving his family and the neighborhood crazy. Finally they all decided something had to be done. They all approached him and said, \"Mulla, you are a man of great wisdom, but you are driving us crazy! We have seen many players, many musicians, but this is strange -- just one note?\nYou never change, you simply go on playing the same again and again. It has become so much that even when you stop we go on hearing it! So please,\" they requested \"learn a few more notes.\"\nMulla Nasruddin said \"That is not possible. The others play other notes because they have not yet found their note. I have found mine, there is no need for me to search, I have already arrived. This is my note, this is my whole life. And why should I practise unnecessary things which are not mine...? I am doing my thing and I am enjoying it. If you cannot enjoy it that is your problem.\"\nIt is easy to play one note, very easy -- no practise is needed, any fool can do it. And that's what man has done in the past: a few people chose to be introverts. They were silent but they were without song -- flat, boring, dull, almost dead. You have called them saints. And the others chose the outside world: very excited, always on the go, in a great hurry, not knowing where they were going, just running round and round in circles, in a state of delirium, shouting, fighting. There was great hustle and bustle but no silence.\nBoth attitudes are wrong.\nMy sannyasin has to prove a new man in the world. He has to prove that there is no need to divide, that there is no question of either-or; I teach both and not either-or. And the moment both are together there is something more than both, because the meeting of two polarities is not just the sum total; the total is more than the sum t1otal of the parts. That is beauty and that is ecstasy and that is god\n-- a phenomenon which is more than the sum total of the parts. LOVE: A GIFT BOX THAT HOLDS A PARADOX\n(Osho explains the nature of the paradox.)\nLove is a paradox, it has to be a paradox because it contains the whole mystery of existence. From one side, from the outside, it is just a dewdrop; but if you look from within it is the whole ocean.\nThis is something very essential to be understood: all that is great will always look ordinary from the outside because it is not objective. The way to look at it from the outside is to make it an object.\nThe real values of life are subjective. The right way to look at them is from the inside. Unless you are getting exactly in the middle of the experience you will not be able to know what it is. From the innermost core it becomes immense, infinite, from the outside it is very small.\nIt is just like man; if you look at a man from the outside then what is he? At the most he will need a six-feet-long, two-feet-wide grave, and that will be more than enough. But if you look from the inside of man, he contains universes.\nThose who have looked from within are all agreed on one point, that the inner is infinite, unbounded.\nJesus calls it the kingdom of god, Buddha calls it nirvana, enlightenment; light and light and light with no end -- you cannot find the boundary. That is the meaning of enlightenment; you can go on searching for the boundary but you will never find it. Mahavira calls it freedom, freedom from all limits. But from the outside man is so ordinary. Just a small dagger can kill him, a small bullet can kill him.\nLook at a rose flower -- it is so small that you can crush it in your fist, but its beauty is immense. You cannot contain it in anything. If you know the beauty then you know that the flower is only a small expression of it. If you really know the beauty then the flower is part of the beauty, not vice versa. If you know only the flower then you will say beauty is only part of the flower. If you know man from within, you will not say that the soul is within the body, you will say the body is within the soul.… Because the soul is vast - how can it be within the body? And the same is true about love because love is the flowering of your being.\nIf you look from the outside it looks blind, and people condemn it. They think you are just being foolish, 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nillogical, because they are observing in a scientific way and there is no way to prove it in a test tube. You cannot go into a scientific lab and put your love on the table for them to dissect and to find out what it is all about. But you know that it is far more valuable than life itself. Lovers have sacrificed their life for love.\nOne can sacrifice everything for love -- it is an ultimate value.\nSo your name is beautiful: love is a small gift, yet it contains the greatest gift in it. Go on loving, go on giving your love for the sheer joy of giving, with no desire for any return, with not even the desire that somebody says a thank-you. Then slowly slowly you will get deeper into it, and one day that miraculous moment arrives when you are centered exactly in the middle of the flower of love.\nAnd then you know love is not less than god -- love is god. FROM EGO TO ETERNITY\n(Amrit Shunyo means the secret of immortality, and nothingness.) The secret of immortality is to die as an ego. Be just a zero and you have attained to the\neternal, because the zero cannot be killed by death.\nThe ego can be killed by death, it is bound to be because it is our invention, it is man-made -- and whatsoever is man-made cannot last forever. Even if we make castles of rocks, sooner or later they will disappear, they will become sand. It is only a question of time but nothing which is made by man can remain.\nOnce I was staying in a small village, one of the smallest villages I have ever visited. Only ninety people lived there, but just seven hundred years before it was one of the greatest cities of this country; nine hundred thousand people lived there. The whole place is full of palaces and there is nobody to live in them; all are falling down, all are ruins.\nThere is only one small hotel for the tourists, with only five rooms because nobody ever comes. I was staying with a very rich man and he was planning to make a beautiful house in his own city and he was continuously talking about it. I listened to him; again and again he was obsessed with the idea of how to make that house the most beautiful in the whole of the city -- and he lived in a big city, he lived in Calcutta.\nTo make a house in Calcutta which surpasses all the houses is not easy; it is one of the most populated cities of the world and has beautiful palaces. But he had money and he could manage it, so he was asking my advice, Rather than giving him advice I took him out and I told him 'Just look around -- for miles there are ruins.' I said 'Think how much these people must have planned. For hundred of years this city was being built... great palaces. There are mosques where ten thou and people can pray together. There are caravanserais, ruins, where ten thousand camels can stay together. It was one of the greatest cities, but now there are only ruins, And what are you planning for? I asked him, 'Even if you make a beautiful house, you will be gone, your house will be gone. Nothing man-made is going to stay forever -- why waste your energy? Rather than wasting energy in something man-made, why not discover that which god has made within you?'\nIt was very shocking to him, he was not expecting this. But the shock was of immense value -- the man changed. For the throe days we stayed together he never talked about the house. Many times I asked 'What about the house?' He said 'Forget all about it. You destroyed it before I made it.' And he never made it.\nWhen I last visited him he was just on his deathbed and he said, 'You saved my\nenergy, because once that idea was dropped I had all the energy to discover myself.'\nAmrit Shunyo means become a zero, drop the ego and all the projections of the ego so that you can discover the eternal within you. We belong to eternity, we are part of eternity. We should not waste ourselves in small creations which are just soap bubbles, nothing much, not more than that.\nThese are the only two possible ways for a person to live: either as an ego or as a zero. A sannyasin lives as a zero, a nobody, a nothingness. And immense is his joy, great is his bliss, infinite is his beauty, because god starts pouring through him. Just because he is a zero he becomes a vehicle, a passage; there is no obstruction in him. The ego is the greatest obstruction. The ego means your flute is blocked, stuffed, no song can flow through it.\nTo be a zero means you are just a hollow bamboo and god can make a flute out of you.\nULTIMATE COMMUNION: TOTAL DISSOLUTION 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\n(Anand Samvado -- bliss-dialogue.)\nOne can be in an argument with existence or one can be in a dialogue. When you are in argument with existence you are fighting, you are trying to prove yourself right and existence wrong. When you are in a dialogue there is no question of proving yourself right or existence wrong. There is no a priori idea; you are just in communion. You are in search of truth.\nThe argumentator already thinks he knows the truth. He is not a seeker. He already believes in the truth, he is not an explorer. He believes that he has found, although that belief is absolutely unfounded, It is not true. He has just accumulated ideas which are floating in the air, from the scriptures, from the\ntraditions, from people around, and he is trying to convince himself and others that these ideas are his. In fact no thought is yours -- they are all unoriginal. Thought as such is never original; no-thought is original.\nIf you are in an argument with existence then you are trying to prove your thought, right and existence is absolutely silent: you can go on imposing your ideas -- existence will not refute them, remember. For thousands of years people believed that the earth is flat. The earth never denied it (laughter), not even once.\nPeople believed that the sun goes around the earth, and the sun never denied it --\n-who bothers?\nDo you bother what mosquitoes go on thinking about you? Nobody bothers whether the mosquitoes think that Jesus is the messiah or not, whether Mohammed is the prophet or not, whether Buddha is really enlightened or not. In the same way existence has no interest in what man thinks.\nBut a miracle happens, the moment you are silent, the moment you are open, not trying to prove something, not trying to say something to existence but ready to listen, available, existence immediately becomes immensely interested in you. It opens up its heart, it allows you to enter into its mysteries -- that is Samvado.\nThe seeker has to be silent, then god speaks. If you speak then god remains silent. Only one can speak. If you want to listen to the voice of existence itself then learn the art of being silent. Then disappear completely. Then just be there, available, open, receptive, and you will be flooded with truth, with light and that light, that truth, will liberate you, will make you what you are supposed to be, what you intrinsically need to be. Your real destiny will be fulfilled. You will feel immense gratefulness and tremendous contentment.\nBut one has to learn the art of being silent, then a dialogue with existence happens.\nMartin Buber, one of the most important Jewish thinkers of this age, has written a famous book, I AND\nTHOU, and he propounded the idea that prayer is an I-Thou dialogue. But he was just a thinker not a mystic\n-- a philosopher but not a Buddha. He came very close, he almost stumbled on\nthe truth -- but stumbled. He guessed approximately but missed too.\nAs far as the word 'dialogue' is concerned he is absolutely right, prayer is a dialogue. But when he said it is a dialogue between I and Thou he missed the point. It is not a dialogue between I and Thou, because if I and Thou are there, there is going to be an argument. I and Thou can only fight and argue; a dialogue is not possible. The very idea of I is argumentative. The I says 'I am right; how can you be right?' So the word\n'dialogue' that he has come across is beautiful but it is only guesswork, so he can be forgiven.\nWhen real dialogue happens there is only Thou, no I. That is the beginning of dialogues the I disappears, there is only Thou. And then the end of the dialogue is when Thou also disappear, there is complete silence.\nJalaluddin Rumi, one of the most significant Sufi mystics, has reached a little deeper than Martin Buber.\nIn his famous poem a lover knocks on the door of his beloved, and the beloved asks from inside 'Who are you?' He says 'Cannot you guess by my voice, by my footsteps?' And the beloved says 'If you still are that much then this house is very small -- it cannot contain two. When you have completely disappeared come back.'\nAnd the lover goes and moves into the forest. Moons come and go, days pass, months pass, years pass, and one day he is no more. So Rumi says he comes back and knocks on the door. There is the same question again 'Who are you? He says 'I am no more -- only you are, and the door opens, he is received.'\nHe goes a little deeper than Martin Buber but as far as I am concerned it too is only the beginning, not the end. If I am to write the poem or if I meet Jalaludin Rumi then I will insist on his changing it, adding something more to it; it is half. He must have written it in his early days. He must have written it when he had attained only the experience of satori, not of samadhi, because if the man had really dropped his ego who would be there to come back and knock on the door? I would change this much, the last part.\nThe first part is beautiful: years pass and slowly slowly he disappears. Then there is nobody to come 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nback. Now the beloved comes in search of him -- that would be my end of the story. She comes and shakes him up out of his meditation saying, 'What are you doing? I have been waiting and waiting and waiting.'\nAnd he asks 'Who are you?' (much laughter) 'Come only when the I has disappeared.' Then the story will be complete, then the dialogue is absolute when both have disappeared. Then there is unity, then there is communion, union -- neither I nor thou.

Dhyano Ursula.) The first birth is only physical. It is ordinary; it
happens to animals, to trees, to insects, it happens to everybody. It is
a natural phenomenon.</p><p>Meditation is a second birth. It happens only when you deliberately
and consciously take part in it. In that way it is not natural. it is
transcendental to nature. And it is only meditation that makes a man a
man.</p><p>otherwise he is just an animal. Without meditation there is no
distinction between man and animal. Maybe 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished>Osho's books on

a little more</p><p>cunning, a little more alertness -- but those are not qualitative
differences, only quantitative.</p><p>Meditation gives you a qualitative distinction -- and that is the
meaning of Ursula: of distinguished quality.</p><p>Without meditation man has no distinction. With meditation his whole
life goes through a radical change; from horizontal he becomes vertical,
from moving in time he starts moving in eternity. Eternity is vertical,
time is horizontal; hence time can be divided into past, present,
future. It is a line: the art of the line that has gone is the past, the
part of the line that is in front of you is the present, and the part of
the line that is going to be in front of you is the future. But eternity
is indivisible, it is only now. There is no past, no future; it is only
present.</p><p>Hence meditation is an art of living here and now, of getting out of
the past and of the future. Those two are the basic pillars of the mind.
Once those pillars are removed the mind collapses and in the death of
the mind is your birth, the second birth. And once you know your
eternity there is great joy, there is great understanding, gratitude,
prayer. All that is valuable starts flowering in you. Life becomes a
living fragrance.</p><p>IN THE THICK OF THE WORLD AND_THE THIN OF THE IN</p><p>(One has to learn to move freely between the two.)</p><p>Man has completely forgotten the inner dimension, he has become
obsessed with the outer. He goes on and on changing toys, more money,
more power, more prestige. These are all toys. You can play with them
but meanwhile you are wasting precious time. They can keep you occupied
but they will also keep you in deep anguish, in tension, in anxiety, for
the simple reason that the world outside is a world of competition, it
is struggle. You are not alone there; millions and millions of people
are searching for the same things.</p><p>All are after money, so everybody is at each other's throat. It is a
violent struggle, a war -- sometimes in the open, sometimes underground.
Life on the outside remains feverish; it is a kind of delirium, an
insanity.</p><p>There is no rest, no peace, no bliss, no relaxation, unless one
enters inside, then one enters a totally different world. There you are
alone. There is no question of conflict, there is nobody to fight
anybody, no question of competition. There is</p><p>nothing to achieve, nothing to lose, nothing to gain; a great
calmness descends upon you. That is the meaning of Sauro; Sauro means in
the shade.</p><p>To be outside yourself is to be under the hot sun, it is to be
continuously under fire. To be in is to be in the shade -- cool, calm,
collected.</p><p>My sannyasins have to learn the whole art of being available to both
worlds. I am not against the outside world, I am only against its
insanity; and that insanity can be balanced by inner sanity, then there
is no problem. If you can keep cool under the hot sun there is no
problem. If you can keep cool in the tumult and noise of life there is
no problem. If you can remain relaxed in the marketplace there is no
need to go anywhere. So you have to learn the art of moving in and out
easily, just as you move outside and inside your house -- there is no
problem in it.</p><p>But for centuries we have been told that you can either be an
extrovert or an introvert -- and not only the old traditions say so;
even one of the most important psychologists of this age, Carl Gustav
Jung repeats the same thing -- either-or, either you are an extrovert or
you are an introvert. Nobody has recognized even the possibility of
being flexible. When there is time to go out, go out, when there is time
to come in, come in, and let them balance each other. This balancing is
my sannyas.</p><p>My sannyas cannot be categorized by Carl Gustav Jung, my sannyasin
will defy his categorization. Jung cannot call him introvert because he
loves, relates, creates -- he is in the thick of the world. He enjoys
both worlds. When you can have both worlds why choose one? That is
foolish! But for centuries man has chosen one.</p><p>There was a reason: to choose one is simple, you avoid complexity.
But complexity has its own beauty.</p><p>It is simple to grow only roses in your garden, you will become a
great expert in growing roses, but your garden will not look like a
garden. It needs all the colors, all the flowers, all the fragrances.
Your roses cannot replace the nightqueen -- there is no way, no rose can
do that. Your roses cannot become the sunflowers -- they cannot move
with the sun, they are not sun-worshippers. Your roses are beautiful but
they are beautiful only in the whole orchestra of the garden, otherwise
they are boring. Even the most 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on

one art. To know all the flowers, their seasons, their seeds, the manure
they need creates complexity.</p><p>Hence for centuries man has chosen only one world: either being an
introvert then moving into a monastery, becoming a monk or a nun and
living the life of a closed existence -- no windows, no doors to the
outside world... Yes, it will be a very simple existence but there will
be no song in it. It will be dull and flat. It will be like a person
continuously playing a single note on the guitar.</p><p>I have heard: Mulla Nasruddin was learning the guitar. He would just
go on playing a single note again and again, day in, day out. He was
driving his family and the neighborhood crazy. Finally they all decided
something had to be done. They all approached him and said, "Mulla, you
are a man of great wisdom, but you are driving us crazy! We have seen
many players, many musicians, but this is strange -- just one note?</p><p>You never change, you simply go on playing the same again and again.
It has become so much that even when you stop we go on hearing it! So
please," they requested "learn a few more notes."</p><p>Mulla Nasruddin said "That is not possible. The others play other
notes because they have not yet found their note. I have found mine,
there is no need for me to search, I have already arrived. <em>This</em>
is my note, <em>this</em> is my whole life. And why should I practise
unnecessary things which are not mine...? I am doing my thing and I am
enjoying it. If you cannot enjoy it that is your problem."</p><p>It is easy to play one note, very easy -- no practise is needed, any
fool can do it. And that's what man has done in the past: a few people
chose to be introverts. They were silent but they were without song --
flat, boring, dull, almost dead. You have called them saints. And the
others chose the outside world: very excited, always on the go, in a
great hurry, not knowing where they were going, just running round and
round in circles, in a state of delirium, shouting, fighting. There was
great hustle and bustle but no silence.</p><p>Both attitudes are wrong.</p><p>My sannyasin has to prove a new man in the world. He has to prove
that there is no need to divide, that there is no question of either-or;
I teach both and not either-or. And the moment both are together there
is something more than both, because the meeting of two polarities is
not just the sum total; the total is more than the sum t1otal of the
parts. That is beauty and that is ecstasy and that is god</p><p>-- a phenomenon which is more than the sum total of the parts. LOVE:
A GIFT BOX THAT HOLDS A PARADOX</p><p>(Osho explains the nature of the paradox.)</p><p>Love is a paradox, it has to be a paradox because it contains the
whole mystery of existence. From one side, from the outside, it is just
a dewdrop; but if you look from within it is the whole ocean.</p><p>This is something very essential to be understood: all that is great
will always look ordinary from the outside because it is not objective.
The way to look at it from the outside is to make it an object.</p><p>The real values of life are subjective. The right way to look at them
is from the inside. Unless you are getting exactly in the middle of the
experience you will not be able to know what it is. From the innermost
core it becomes immense, infinite, from the outside it is very
small.</p><p>It is just like man; if you look at a man from the outside then what
is he? At the most he will need a six-feet-long, two-feet-wide grave,
and that will be more than enough. But if you look from the inside of
man, he contains universes.</p><p>Those who have looked from within are all agreed on one point, that
the inner is infinite, unbounded.</p><p>Jesus calls it the kingdom of god, Buddha calls it nirvana,
enlightenment; light and light and light with no end -- you cannot find
the boundary. That is the meaning of enlightenment; you can go on
searching for the boundary but you will never find it. Mahavira calls it
freedom, freedom from all limits. But from the outside man is so
ordinary. Just a small dagger can kill him, a small bullet can kill
him.</p><p>Look at a rose flower -- it is so small that you can crush it in your
fist, but its beauty is immense. You cannot contain it in anything. If
you know the beauty then you know that the flower is only a small
expression of it. If you really know the beauty then the flower is part
of the beauty, not vice versa. If you know only the flower then you will
say beauty is only part of the flower. If you know man from within, you
will not say that the soul is within the body, you will say the body is
within the soul.… Because the soul is vast - how can it be within the
body? And the same is true about love because love is the flowering of
your being.</p><p>If you look from the outside it looks blind, and people condemn it.
They think you are just being foolish, 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>illogical, because they are observing in a scientific way and there
is no way to prove it in a test tube. You cannot go into a scientific
lab and put your love on the table for them to dissect and to find out
what it is all about. But you know that it is far more valuable than
life itself. Lovers have sacrificed their life for love.</p><p>One can sacrifice everything for love -- it is an ultimate value.</p><p>So your name is beautiful: love is a small gift, yet it contains the
greatest gift in it. Go on loving, go on giving your love for the sheer
joy of giving, with no desire for any return, with not even the desire
that somebody says a thank-you. Then slowly slowly you will get deeper
into it, and one day that miraculous moment arrives when you are
centered exactly in the middle of the flower of love.</p><p>And then you know love is not less than god -- love <em>is</em> god.
FROM EGO TO ETERNITY</p><p>(Amrit Shunyo means the secret of immortality, and nothingness.) The
secret of immortality is to die as an ego. Be just a zero and you have
attained to the</p><p>eternal, because the zero cannot be killed by death.</p><p>The ego can be killed by death, it is bound to be because it is our
invention, it is man-made -- and whatsoever is man-made cannot last
forever. Even if we make castles of rocks, sooner or later they will
disappear, they will become sand. It is only a question of time but
nothing which is made by man can remain.</p><p>Once I was staying in a small village, one of the smallest villages I
have ever visited. Only ninety people lived there, but just seven
hundred years before it was one of the greatest cities of this country;
nine hundred thousand people lived there. The whole place is full of
palaces and there is nobody to live in them; all are falling down, all
are ruins.</p><p>There is only one small hotel for the tourists, with only five rooms
because nobody ever comes. I was staying with a very rich man and he was
planning to make a beautiful house in his own city and he was
continuously talking about it. I listened to him; again and again he was
obsessed with the idea of how to make that house the most beautiful in
the whole of the city -- and he lived in a big city, he lived in
Calcutta.</p><p>To make a house in Calcutta which surpasses all the houses is not
easy; it is one of the most populated cities of the world and has
beautiful palaces. But he had money and he could manage it, so he was
asking my advice, Rather than giving him advice I took him out and I
told him 'Just look around -- for miles there are ruins.' I said 'Think
how much these people must have planned. For hundred of years this city
was being built... great palaces. There are mosques where ten thou and
people can pray together. There are caravanserais, ruins, where ten
thousand camels can stay together. It was one of the greatest cities,
but now there are only ruins, And what are you planning for? I asked
him, 'Even if you make a beautiful house, you will be gone, your house
will be gone. Nothing man-made is going to stay forever -- why waste
your energy? Rather than wasting energy in something man-made, why not
discover that which god has made within you?'</p><p>It was very shocking to him, he was not expecting this. But the shock
was of immense value -- the man changed. For the throe days we stayed
together he never talked about the house. Many times I asked 'What about
the house?' He said 'Forget all about it. You destroyed it before I made
it.' And he never made it.</p><p>When I last visited him he was just on his deathbed and he said, 'You
saved my</p><p>energy, because once that idea was dropped I had all the energy to
discover myself.'</p><p>Amrit Shunyo means become a zero, drop the ego and all the
projections of the ego so that you can discover the eternal within you.
We belong to eternity, we are part of eternity. We should not waste
ourselves in small creations which are just soap bubbles, nothing much,
not more than that.</p><p>These are the only two possible ways for a person to live: either as
an ego or as a zero. A sannyasin lives as a zero, a nobody, a
nothingness. And immense is his joy, great is his bliss, infinite is his
beauty, because god starts pouring through him. Just because he is a
zero he becomes a vehicle, a passage; there is no obstruction in him.
The ego is the greatest obstruction. The ego means your flute is
blocked, stuffed, no song can flow through it.</p><p>To be a zero means you are just a hollow bamboo and god can make a
flute out of you.</p><p>ULTIMATE COMMUNION: TOTAL DISSOLUTION 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>(Anand Samvado -- bliss-dialogue.)</p><p>One can be in an argument with existence or one can be in a dialogue.
When you are in argument with existence you are fighting, you are trying
to prove yourself right and existence wrong. When you are in a dialogue
there is no question of proving yourself right or existence wrong. There
is no a priori idea; you are just in communion. You are in search of
truth.</p><p>The argumentator already thinks he knows the truth. He is not a
seeker. He already believes in the truth, he is not an explorer. He
believes that he has found, although that belief is absolutely
unfounded, It is not true. He has just accumulated ideas which are
floating in the air, from the scriptures, from the</p><p>traditions, from people around, and he is trying to convince himself
and others that these ideas are his. In fact no thought is yours -- they
are all unoriginal. Thought as such is never original; no-thought is
original.</p><p>If you are in an argument with existence then you are trying to prove
your thought, right and existence is absolutely silent: you can go on
imposing your ideas -- existence will not refute them, remember. For
thousands of years people believed that the earth is flat. The earth
never denied it (laughter), not even once.</p><p>People believed that the sun goes around the earth, and the sun never
denied it --</p><p>-who bothers?</p><p>Do you bother what mosquitoes go on thinking about you? Nobody
bothers whether the mosquitoes think that Jesus is the messiah or not,
whether Mohammed is the prophet or not, whether Buddha is really
enlightened or not. In the same way existence has no interest in what
man thinks.</p><p>But a miracle happens, the moment you are silent, the moment you are
open, not trying to prove something, not trying to say something to
existence but ready to listen, available, existence immediately becomes
immensely interested in you. It opens up its heart, it allows you to
enter into its mysteries -- that is Samvado.</p><p>The seeker has to be silent, then god speaks. If <em>you</em> speak
then god remains silent. Only one can speak. If you want to listen to
the voice of existence itself then learn the art of being silent. Then
disappear completely. Then just be there, available, open, receptive,
and you will be flooded with truth, with light and that light, that
truth, will liberate you, will make you what you are supposed to be,
what you intrinsically need to be. Your real destiny will be fulfilled.
You will feel immense gratefulness and tremendous contentment.</p><p>But one has to learn the art of being silent, then a dialogue with
existence happens.</p><p>Martin Buber, one of the most important Jewish thinkers of this age,
has written a famous book, I AND</p><p>THOU, and he propounded the idea that prayer is an I-Thou dialogue.
But he was just a thinker not a mystic</p><p>-- a philosopher but not a Buddha. He came very close, he almost
stumbled on</p><p>the truth -- but stumbled. He guessed approximately but missed
too.</p><p>As far as the word 'dialogue' is concerned he is absolutely right,
prayer <em>is</em> a dialogue. But when he said it is a dialogue between
I and Thou he missed the point. It is not a dialogue between I and Thou,
because if I and Thou are there, there is going to be an argument. I and
Thou can only fight and argue; a dialogue is not possible. The very idea
of I is argumentative. The I says 'I am right; how can you be right?' So
the word</p><p>'dialogue' that he has come across is beautiful but it is only
guesswork, so he can be forgiven.</p><p>When real dialogue happens there is only Thou, no I. That is the
beginning of dialogues the I disappears, there is only Thou. And then
the end of the dialogue is when Thou also disappear, there is complete
silence.</p><p>Jalaluddin Rumi, one of the most significant Sufi mystics, has
reached a little deeper than Martin Buber.</p><p>In his famous poem a lover knocks on the door of his beloved, and the
beloved asks from inside 'Who are you?' He says 'Cannot you guess by my
voice, by my footsteps?' And the beloved says 'If you still are
<em>that</em> much then this house is very small -- it cannot contain
two. When you have completely disappeared come back.'</p><p>And the lover goes and moves into the forest. Moons come and go, days
pass, months pass, years pass, and one day he is no more. So Rumi says
he comes back and knocks on the door. There is the same question again
'Who are you? He says 'I am no more -- only you are, and the door opens,
he is received.'</p><p>He goes a little deeper than Martin Buber but as far as I am
concerned it too is only the beginning, not the end. If I am to write
the poem or if I meet Jalaludin Rumi then I will insist on his changing
it, adding something more to it; it is half. He must have written it in
his early days. He must have written it when he had attained only the
experience of satori, not of samadhi, because if the man had really
dropped his ego who would be there to come back and knock on the door? I
would change this much, the last part.</p><p>The first part is beautiful: years pass and slowly slowly he
disappears. Then there is nobody to come 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-4>Osho's books on

of the story. She comes and shakes him up out of his meditation saying,
'What are you doing? I have been waiting and waiting and waiting.'</p><p>And he asks 'Who are you?' (much laughter) 'Come only when the I has
disappeared.' Then the story will be complete, then the dialogue is
absolute when both have disappeared. Then there is unity, then there is
communion, union -- neither I nor thou. Martin Buber says prayer is an
I-Thou dialogue, Jalaluddin Rumi says prayer is no I but only Thou; I
say no I, no Thou, then there is dialogue. And that dialogue is the
ultimate goal of all religiousness.</p><p>-- How long will you be here?</p><p>-- A couple of months.</p><p>-- Good. Next time come for a longer period. If you are still there,

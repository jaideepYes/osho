It is for reference purposes only.]\nGOALS ARE GAOLS\n(Let go of the ego and god takes care, Osho tells Raimund.) Man exists as an ego, that's why he feels continuously afraid, unprotected, insecure. The moment you drop your ego the whole existence becomes your protection, your security.\nYou cannot be more wise than the whole. The part cannot be bigger than the whole. Whatsoever we can do think is bound to be small, tiny; it comes out of a tiny mind. Its vision is small, its capacity to see is limited. But we depend on this small capacity, we depend on our blindness, and then we suffer. The mind is very short-sighted. It is because of this approach that people live in misery, anxiety, anguish, suffering; they create their own hell.\nSannyas means a radical change, dropping the ego and relaxing with the whole -- because the whole is wiser than the part -- trusting the whole. The whole is our source, we have come from it, we are in it even at this moment. Just as the fish is in the ocean, we are in gods we are born in god, we live in God and we will disappear in God; hence the whole effort to fight with the universe is idiotic.\nThe sannyasin relaxes, he becomes a let-go. He allows the whole to possess him, to direct him, to guide him. He surrenders himself totally so the whole can possess him without any hindrance from his side, without any resistance from his side -- and then he is protected.\nGod is a wise protector. It is up to us to live in insecurity or to live in the ultimate security. To be in the ego is to live in insecurity; to be egoless is to live in ultimate security. Then all is good because you don't have any expectations, you don't have any private goal. You are simply one with the whole so wherever it is going you are going; you need not worry. Then you become just like a small child who is holding the hand of his father\nThe father may be worried, the father may have got lost in the forest, but the child is not worried. He knows his father is with him, his hand is in his father's hand -- that's enough. The child is enjoying while the father is worrying; the child is enjoying the butterflies and the birds and the flowers. He can enjoy them because of his trust. He has no worry, no anxiety.\nTo relax with the whole is the beginning of a joyous life. It is the beginning of an authentic ceremony.\nThen each moment is so full of juice and ecstasy that one can become drunk. And the person who relaxes with the whole becomes drunk with the divine. His joy knows no limits, his bliss is infinite EGO IS I-DIOTIC\n(Buddha calls it atta, and no-ego, anatta.)\nThis is the whole problem, how to move from the ego to the no-ego. It is not impossible but certainly it is difficult. And the difficulty arises because of our habits. We have been trained to be egos -- conditioned, hypnotised. It has gone deep into our blood, our bones, into our marrow. We have completely forgotten that it is possible to be without the ego. It has become our identity. We know only one way, we are only acquainted with this false entity, the ego.\nIt is imposed on us, it is not real, hence it can be disposed of, but it has been in us for so long, hence the difficulty. Otherwise the state of egolessness is our very nature; it should be very simple to be egoless. But for that one has to pass through a deep unconditioning, a process of de-hypnosis -- and that is how I define sannyas; it is a process of de-hypnosis. What society has done to you has to be undone.\nThe ego is absolutely false -- no child is born with it Now even psychologists agree that the child first becomes aware of others then he becomes aware of himself; it is secondary. First he comes to know 'thou'\nand then he starts creating the idea of I. He sees people moving, coming and going, and naturally he starts inferring that they are separate. Sometimes the mother is there and sometimes she is not there, sometimes the father comes and then disappears, so he starts learning one thing, a kind of vague separation. And then we give a child a name.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nIn the beginning every child uses his name in the third person. If his name is Johnny, he says 'Johnny is hungry', he does not say 'I am hungry'. The I has not yet arisen. Johnny is another person, as the others are.\nIf he falls and is hurt, he says 'Johnny is hurt' he has not yet learned the idea of I. But sooner or later he will have to learn it because the whole society -- the parents, the education -- everybody will insist that you replace this name with I. The name is for others to use, you have to use this word 'I'. And then it starts settling in our unconscious. Once we start living around this idea our whole life becomes false and phony, because it is moving around a false centre\nTo become a sannyasin means to drop all that is false and to discover that which is real and essential.\nThe moment it is discovered you enter into a totally different kind of life. Once\nthe phoniness disappears, once the falsity disappears, each moment becomes so full of ecstasy that it is almost impossible to believe that so much ecstasy is available. But the ecstasy is available only to the real. For the false there is only misery.\nPeople go on trying to drop misery and to become blissful -- that is not possible. The real change has to happen somewhere deeper, not on the surface. You cannot change suffering into blissfulness; you have to change the root cause of suffering, the false ego has to be dropped, discarded, thrown into the rubbish bin.\nAnd then suddenly the gestalt changes, your energy starts flowing through the real. And whenever you are in contact with the real there is joy. Joy is a by- product of being real.\nIt is just like a real rose and a plastic rose, the plastic rose may look like the real rose but it cannot have a fragrance. The real rose may not look so beautiful as the plastic rose but it has a fragrance. Man can be deceived, but you cannot deceive the bees. Put out both flowers, and you will be surprised: no one ever comes to the plastic rose but they will always come and visit the real rose. God visits the real rose. He is like a bees you cannot deceive him.\nSo this is going to be your work upon yourself: move from the ego to the egolessness. The name, Anatta, will remind you again and again that you have to be nobody, a nothingness -- and that is the greatest thing that can happen to anybody. It is nirvana. The disappearance of the ego becomes the appearance of god in you.\n(LIFE IS A XMAS PUDDING: THE SIXPENCES ARE INSIDE.)\nThe only richness belongs to the inner world. The wealth that we see on the outside is nothing but delusion. It can give you comfort -- delusions can be very comfortable -- it can make your life convenient, but it cannot give you significance or meaning. And without meaning one remains poor.\nRichness can have only one meaning and that is to feel significance, to feel that you are not accidental, that you are part of this beautiful existence, that without you the existence will miss something, that you are fulfilling a certain purpose.\nThe moment one feels that I am fulfilling a certain purpose life becomes illumined, then life is more like a dance. It is not emptiness, it is overflowing\nwith joy. The greatest joy in life is to be needed by god.\nMan's greatest need is to be needed, and to be needed by god, by existence itself is to become meaningful. Then you are not just dust. Then you are not just the body, you are far more. And the feeling of that 'far more' fulfills one, gives tremendous contentment, makes one feel at home with existence.\nHAVING AN ABSOLUTELY DEVICEFUL TIME\nAlexander the Great is not a victorious person, Gautam the Buddha is -- although on the surface it seems just the opposite. Alexander conquered the whole world and Buddha renounced even his kingdom. But Buddha lived in ecstasy and died in ecstasy; his life was beautiful. His grace was the ultimate grace, his death the ultimate grace.\nAlexander lived an ugly life; he was an alcoholic. He died when he was only thirty-three and he died because of too much drinking; he became a drunkard just to forget his misery and suffering. He was not happy with himself. The happy person need not go to alcohol; it is only the miserable person who goes to alcohols to forget, to drown his miseries and sufferings. Although Alexander was the greatest conqueror the world has known, he died frustrated; he died as a beggar. And he died knowing that he had missed the whole point.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThe real victory is inner, not outer. Unless you know yourself you cannot be victorious. And if you know yourself you need not be victorious is anything else. In knowing oneself one becomes the greatest conqueror.\nMy sannyasins have to become not beggars but emperors. And it is easier to conquer yourself than to conquer the whole world. It is a very simple process and it is not a long journey either, it is the small trick of turning in. Once you have known how to turn in you have known all that is there to know you have all that is worth having.\nBeing here with me, learn only the knack of turning in. All the devices are available here. It has neVer been so. Buddha had only one device. Mahavira had another. In the past each master functioned only through one device, hence his device was useful only for a part of humanity, not for all My commune is a synthesis of all the paths, hence anybody who comes to my door is welcome. I can help every type of person. All the past devices are available is here, all that have been discovered recently, the present ones, and all that may be discovered tomorrow What is going to happen tomorrow is already happening here today -- so don't miss the opportunity!\nNO NEED TO CALL GOD, HE'LL CALL YOU\n(Just make sure you're home when He does.)\nMan cannot go in search of God because we don't know where he is, what he looks like. Even if you somehow happen to meet him you will not be able to recognize him. In fact you may have met him many times, because he comes in all forms and all sizes and all shapes. But how to recognize him? There is no way to. You can recognize only that which you already know, and you don't know him. Hence my approach is totally different: it is not a search for God, it is only an invitation to God. We can invite him.\nHe can find us, we cannot find him - he knows us, we don't know him. He exactly knows our address, our location, so all that is needed on our part is to be ready: if he comes we have to be receptive and we have to prepare the house for the ultimate guest.\nThe whole of sannyas is a preparation - not a search, but a preparation. You have to cleanse your being; you have to become silent, spacious. You have to make your being a small shrine, worthy for God to abide in.\nSannyas is an unaddressed invitation, to whomsoever it may concern.\nMy observation is that searchers never find him; only the people who invite him have found him, because invitation means a great task: you have to transform yourself totally to be worthy to receive. You have to be loving, you have to be alert, you have to be sensitive, you have to be creative. You have to drop all kinds of negativities - anger, jealousy, possessiveness; you have to burn all this rubbish. You have to drop all your knowledge which is borrowed, you have to be again as innocent as a child. And then he comes, then he surely comes.\nJUST TAKE A CHAIR AND LEAN BACK\n(Take it easy and he'll easily take you)\nHe comes to you only when you are absolutely restful, relaxed, calm, quiet, when there is no desire, no thought, when you are not asking for anything, not praying for anything. When you are simply there, in that simplicity god arrives. Hence my whole message can be condensed as the art of total relaxation.\nIt is not through activity that you will find the truth; in fact it is continuous activity that is not allowing you to find it. You need some gaps of interval, some moments when there is no occupation.\nSo that is going to be your work, find as many moments as possible when you can just be. Sit, stand, lie down or walk or swim but do it in such a way that there is no doer, no doing, no strain. And you will be surprised that you have found the key -- the key that opens all the doors of all the mysteries.\nSUN-YES RISE\n(Dhyan means meditation, and Zohra has three meanings, Osho tells another sannyasin) Meditation is a state of absolute silence. It is not prayer, because in prayer your mind functions, you are 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nsaying something to god, praising the lord. But because you are saying something the mind is there; without the mind nothing can be said. And because you are saying something you are not silent even with god.\nPrayer is a dialogue, and one thing has to be very deeply understood -- that god understands no language except the language of silence. He neither understands Sanskrit nor Hebrew nor Arabic nor Latin nor Greek.\nThere are at least three thousand languages on the earth and this is only one of the planets which is populated. Scientists think at least fifty thousand planets are\npopulated -- that is at least, more are possible.\nThis is a very conservative estimate. Three thousand languages on the earth with at least thirty thousand dialects, and then there are fifty thousand planets ... if god is to understand language, he will go crazy.\nGod understands only silence. Prayer is the last function of the mind. Where prayer ends meditation begins, you drop saying anything to god. What can we say? What have we got to say? Prayer is saying something, meditation is listening. Rather than saying something to god it is better to be silent and to listen.\nAnd in silence the message comes, in silence not only the message but god himself comes.\nGod does not come like a person. He does not come shouting, knocking on your doors. He comes very silently, like a fragrance, making no noise. no fuss. God is not a person but a presence.\nA person is bound to be limited. A person can be photographed, an image can be made of a person. No image can be made of god, for the simple reason that he is a presence. You can make a beautiful painting of a rose flower but how will you paint the fragrance of the rose. There is no way at all. So god is not a person but only a presence, a feeling. And that feeling wells up from your innermost core when you are utterly silent, when the mind has gone into complete cessation.\nAnd Zohra is a beautiful word. It is Arabic, It has three meanings. One is the blossoming. It is only in deep meditation that one blossoms, that one comes to one's total unfoldment, otherwise one remains like a bud. In meditation the petals open. The ultimate opening has been described by mystic, as a lotus opening.\nAnd to make it clear that it is a multi-dimensional phenomenon they have called it a one-thousand petalled lotus. But the lotus opens only in the morning when the sun rises. The lotus opens only when the presence of god is felt, the presence of god is just like sunrise for the soul, hence the other two meanings...\nZohra also means the dawn, the beginning of the day, the end of the night; the darkness is over, one has entered into the world of light.\nAnd the second meaning is one whose birth is like sunrise. It is not only that\ngod's presence function, like sunrise and your inner being opens up, it is also a birth for you.\nI have chosen this orange colour for my sannyasins specifically to represent the colour of the sunrise, when the East becomes orange, awaiting the sunrise, when it is getting ready to welcome it.\nThe moment you come in contact with the presence of god it is a birth, a new birth. The first birth happened through the parent, the second birth happens through meditation -- and the first birth is only physical, the second birth is spiritual\nSannyas is fulfilled only when the second birth is achieved, when one is reborn. Jesus says unless you are born again you shall not enter into my kingdom of god.\nMEDITATION: TURNING YOUR SELF ON\n(The light is inside, we just can't find the switch.)\nWe are acquainted with the temporary light, from the light of a candle to the light of the stars. A candle lasts only a few hours and the stars last for millions or years, but both are temporary. The difference is only of quantity, not of quality. The real light -- which is qualitatively different, which is non-temporal, which never begins and never ends, which is always there, which has always been there and will be always there --\nis at the centre of our being.\nMeditation is an enquiry into that inner light. It needs no fuel, that is why it is eternal, it needs no cause, that's why it is eternal. We are born with it, and it is really unfortunate that we carry inside the eternal light and still live in darkness. The foolishness is that we look outside and the light is inside.\nThe whole purpose of a master is to turn you inwards so that you can see your own light. Once seen it is forever yours and then it transforms your whole life. The transformation is so big that it is almost inconceivable unless you have experienced it.\nIt is exactly like a blind man suddenly getting eyes: he cannot imagine what is going to happen when he gets eyes, there is no way for him to imagine. How can\nhe imagine the world of colours? How can he imagine the world of light, of sun, moon, stars? How can he imagine the world of faces, beauty? How can 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nhe imagine all this psychedelic existence? Impossible! He did not even have any idea of darkness, what to say about light?\nThe blind man cannot even understand what darkness is, because to understand darkness you need eyes, without eyes you cannot see even darkness, so the question of visualising light does not arise at all. And the same is the situation as far as the inner growth is concerned: we are are blind.\nThe master cannot describe what is going to happen, he can only persuade you to turn in. Hence there have been many enlightened people but very few enlightened people ever become masters. That is a totally different art, the art of seducing people into something which they cannot even imagine. It is pure salesmanship... and it is selling invisible things - things which you cannot see! And the price is much: you have to lose yourself totally for something which you cannot even see. It needs tremendous trust, it needs a mad love on the part of the disciple, only then can this miracle happen. But it has happened many times so it can happen again and again. Be prepared for it!\nYou have fallen into the hands of a salesman! And it is not that first the goods will be delivered and then you go on paying in instalments. First you have to pay the whole price -- and that means your whole being.\nAnd then nobody knows whether you will get anything out of it or not -- that's the risk! So it is only a game for very adventurous people. But don't be worried -\n- I will take care!\nSANNYAS: A SHOCKING STATE OF AFFAIRS\n(It's only for lovers, Osho warns Manglam.)\nThere are many happy moments in life, many joyous events, but they are all\ndreamlike; they come quickly and they disappear. When they are there you feel good, but when they are gone you feel far worse than before because in the wake you fall into darkness, into a depression.\nSo each joy that happens in life brings, almost equal to it, suffering and agony. In life, joys and sufferings are balanced. There is no way to change the balance. That's what people go on trying: they go on trying to do the impossible. They want to have as much joy as possible and as little suffering as possible.\nBut that is against the arithmetic of existence; it will always be fifty-fifty. You cannot have ninety per cent of joys and ten per cent of suffering. As you start having more joys, you will have more sufferings growing together. They always go together, they are like two sides of the same phenomenon.\nBut there is one ecstasy which is without its opposite - that is called manglam , the ultimate ecstasy.\nOnly that is worth achieving because there is no opposite to it. Once it is yours it transforms your whole being. It is not just a moment that comes and goes, it becomes your very being. In fact it is already your very being but you are not conscious of it. It is as if an emperor has fallen into sleep and is dreaming that he has become a beggar. All that is needed is not to change the beggar into the emperor; all that is needed is to shake him so he wakes up. And that's my work here, to shake you in as many ways possible. And the more you allow me, the more I shake you.\nSlowly slowly shaking turns into shocking. But I go very slow, I give you only that much which you can digest - because to wake up a person who has remained asleep for centuries, for many lives, is not easy work. He has become accustomed to a sleeping consciousness, he knows nothing else, so to bring him into the world of wakefulness needs a certain art - patience, love, a deep compassion.\nBuddha used to say to his disciples that before you become enlightened at least grow as much compassion as you can. Again and again he was asked, \"Why do you emphasize this?\"\nHe said, \"So that when you become enlightened you have enough compassion to help people.\"\nOtherwise many become enlightened but they don't have any compassion. They are enlightened, they are blissful, they have reached to the ultimate good - who bothers about others? They will take their own course. And why interfere in anybody's life? But it is only through compassion that one takes the risk of interfering.\nAnd it is risky because whenever you interfere in anybody's sleep he is going to become angry at you -\njust try to wake up somebody early in the morning when it is cold. Even though he has said to you to wake him early, he has to catch a train; he will become angry, he will go through a tantrum, he will think you are an enemy. There are very few who will be happy about it, and this is ordinary sleep. Humanity can be divided into two types of people: one, who likes to wake up early in the morning, and the second - the rest of us.\nSo the work of the master is really difficult because 'the rest of us' constitutes ninety-nine point nine per cent of humanity. They would like to pull the blanket over their heads and turn to the other side and have a 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nlittle more beautiful dreaming.

CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>[NOTE: This is an unedited tape transcript of an unpublished darshan
diary, which has been scanned and cleaned up. It is for reference
purposes only.]</p><p>GOALS ARE GAOLS</p><p>(Let go of the ego and god takes care, Osho tells Raimund.) Man
exists as an ego, that's why he feels continuously afraid, unprotected,
insecure. The moment you drop your ego the whole existence becomes your
protection, your security.</p><p>You cannot be more wise than the whole. The part cannot be bigger
than the whole. Whatsoever we can do think is bound to be small, tiny;
it comes out of a tiny mind. Its vision is small, its capacity to see is
limited. But we depend on this small capacity, we depend on our
blindness, and then we suffer. The mind is very short-sighted. It is
because of this approach that people live in misery, anxiety, anguish,
suffering; they create their own hell.</p><p>Sannyas means a radical change, dropping the ego and relaxing with
the whole -- because the whole is wiser than the part -- trusting the
whole. The whole is our source, we have come from it, we are in it even
at this moment. Just as the fish is in the ocean, we are in gods we are
born in god, we live in God and we will disappear in God; hence the
whole effort to fight with the universe is idiotic.</p><p>The sannyasin relaxes, he becomes a let-go. He allows the whole to
possess him, to direct him, to guide him. He surrenders himself totally
so the whole can possess him without any hindrance from his side,
without any resistance from his side -- and then he is protected.</p><p>God is a wise protector. It is up to us to live in insecurity or to
live in the ultimate security. To be in the ego is to live in
insecurity; to be egoless is to live in ultimate security. Then all is
good because you don't have any expectations, you don't have any private
goal. You are simply one with the whole so wherever it is going you are
going; you need not worry. Then you become just like a small child who
is holding the hand of his father</p><p>The father may be worried, the father may have got lost in the
forest, but the child is not worried. He knows his father is with him,
his hand is in his father's hand -- that's enough. The child is enjoying
while the father is worrying; the child is enjoying the butterflies and
the birds and the flowers. He can enjoy them because of his trust. He
has no worry, no anxiety.</p><p>To relax with the whole is the beginning of a joyous life. It is the
beginning of an authentic ceremony.</p><p>Then each moment is so full of juice and ecstasy that one can become
drunk. And the person who relaxes with the whole becomes drunk with the
divine. His joy knows no limits, his bliss is infinite EGO IS
I-DIOTIC</p><p>(Buddha calls it atta, and no-ego, anatta.)</p><p>This is the whole problem, how to move from the ego to the no-ego. It
is not impossible but certainly it is difficult. And the difficulty
arises because of our habits. We have been trained to be egos --
conditioned, hypnotised. It has gone deep into our blood, our bones,
into our marrow. We have completely forgotten that it is possible to be
without the ego. It has become our identity. We know only one way, we
are only acquainted with this false entity, the ego.</p><p>It is imposed on us, it is not real, hence it can be disposed of, but
it has been in us for so long, hence the difficulty. Otherwise the state
of egolessness is our very nature; it should be very simple to be
egoless. But for that one has to pass through a deep unconditioning, a
process of de-hypnosis -- and that is how I define sannyas; it is a
process of de-hypnosis. What society has done to you has to be
undone.</p><p>The ego is absolutely false -- no child is born with it Now even
psychologists agree that the child first becomes aware of others then he
becomes aware of himself; it is secondary. First he comes to know
'thou'</p><p>and then he starts creating the idea of I. He sees people moving,
coming and going, and naturally he starts inferring that they are
separate. Sometimes the mother is there and sometimes she is not there,
sometimes the father comes and then disappears, so he starts learning
one thing, a kind of vague separation. And then we give a child a
name.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>In the beginning every child uses his name in the third person. If
his name is Johnny, he says 'Johnny is hungry', he does not say 'I am
hungry'. The I has not yet arisen. Johnny is another person, as the
others are.</p><p>If he falls and is hurt, he says 'Johnny is hurt' he has not yet
learned the idea of I. But sooner or later he will have to learn it
because the whole society -- the parents, the education -- everybody
will insist that you replace this name with I. The name is for others to
use, <em>you</em> have to use this word 'I'. And then it starts settling
in our unconscious. Once we start living around this idea our whole life
becomes false and phony, because it is moving around a false centre</p><p>To become a sannyasin means to drop all that is false and to discover
that which is real and essential.</p><p>The moment it is discovered you enter into a totally different kind
of life. Once</p><p>the phoniness disappears, once the falsity disappears, each moment
becomes so full of ecstasy that it is almost impossible to believe that
so much ecstasy is available. But the ecstasy is available only to the
real. For the false there is only misery.</p><p>People go on trying to drop misery and to become blissful -- that is
not possible. The real change has to happen somewhere deeper, not on the
surface. You cannot change suffering into blissfulness; you have to
change the root cause of suffering, the false ego has to be dropped,
discarded, thrown into the rubbish bin.</p><p>And then suddenly the gestalt changes, your energy starts flowing
through the real. And whenever you are in contact with the real there is
joy. Joy is a by- product of being real.</p><p>It is just like a real rose and a plastic rose, the plastic rose may
look like the real rose but it cannot have a fragrance. The real rose
may not look so beautiful as the plastic rose but it has a fragrance.
Man can be deceived, but you cannot deceive the bees. Put out both
flowers, and you will be surprised: no one ever comes to the plastic
rose but they will always come and visit the real rose. God visits the
real rose. He is like a bees you cannot deceive him.</p><p>So this is going to be your work upon yourself: move from the ego to
the egolessness. The name, Anatta, will remind you again and again that
you have to be nobody, a nothingness -- and that is the greatest thing
that can happen to anybody. It is nirvana. The disappearance of the ego
becomes the appearance of god in you.</p><p>(LIFE IS A XMAS PUDDING: THE SIXPENCES ARE INSIDE.)</p><p>The only richness belongs to the inner world. The wealth that we see
on the outside is nothing but delusion. It can give you comfort --
delusions can be very comfortable -- it can make your life convenient,
but it cannot give you significance or meaning. And without meaning one
remains poor.</p><p>Richness can have only one meaning and that is to feel significance,
to feel that you are not accidental, that you are part of this beautiful
existence, that without you the existence will miss something, that you
are fulfilling a certain purpose.</p><p>The moment one feels that I am fulfilling a certain purpose life
becomes illumined, then life is more like a dance. It is not emptiness,
it is overflowing</p><p>with joy. The greatest joy in life is to be needed by god.</p><p>Man's greatest need is to be needed, and to be needed by god, by
existence itself is to become meaningful. Then you are not just dust.
Then you are not just the body, you are far more. And the feeling of
that 'far more' fulfills one, gives tremendous contentment, makes one
feel at home with existence.</p><p>HAVING AN ABSOLUTELY DEVICEFUL TIME</p><p>Alexander the Great is not a victorious person, Gautam the Buddha is
-- although on the surface it seems just the opposite. Alexander
conquered the whole world and Buddha renounced even his kingdom. But
Buddha lived in ecstasy and died in ecstasy; his life was beautiful. His
grace was the ultimate grace, his death the ultimate grace.</p><p>Alexander lived an ugly life; he was an alcoholic. He died when he
was only thirty-three and he died because of too much drinking; he
became a drunkard just to forget his misery and suffering. He was not
happy with himself. The happy person need not go to alcohol; it is only
the miserable person who goes to alcohols to forget, to drown his
miseries and sufferings. Although Alexander was the greatest conqueror
the world has known, he died frustrated; he died as a beggar. And he
died knowing that he had missed the whole point.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>The real victory is inner, not outer. Unless you know yourself you
cannot be victorious. And if you know yourself you need not be
victorious is anything else. In knowing oneself one becomes the greatest
conqueror.</p><p>My sannyasins have to become not beggars but emperors. And it is
easier to conquer yourself than to conquer the whole world. It is a very
simple process and it is not a long journey either, it is the small
trick of turning in. Once you have known how to turn in you have known
all that is there to know you have all that is worth having.</p><p>Being here with me, learn only the knack of turning in. All the
devices are available here. It has neVer been so. Buddha had only one
device. Mahavira had another. In the past each master functioned only
through one device, hence his device was useful only for a part of
humanity, not for all My commune is a synthesis of all the paths, hence
anybody who comes to my door is welcome. I can help every type of
person. All the past devices are available is here, all that have been
discovered recently, the present ones, and all that may be discovered
tomorrow What is going to happen tomorrow is already happening here
today -- so don't miss the opportunity!</p><p>NO NEED TO CALL GOD, HE'LL CALL YOU</p><p>(Just make sure you're home when He does.)</p><p>Man cannot go in search of God because we don't know where he is,
what he looks like. Even if you somehow happen to meet him you will not
be able to recognize him. In fact you may have met him many times,
because he comes in all forms and all sizes and all shapes. But how to
recognize him? There is no way to. You can recognize only that which you
already know, and you don't know him. Hence my approach is totally
different: it is not a search for God, it is only an invitation to God.
We can invite him.</p><p>He can find us, we cannot find him - he knows us, we don't know him.
He exactly knows our address, our location, so all that is needed on our
part is to be ready: if he comes we have to be receptive and we have to
prepare the house for the ultimate guest.</p><p>The whole of sannyas is a preparation - not a search, but a
preparation. You have to cleanse your being; you have to become silent,
spacious. You have to make your being a small shrine, worthy for God to
abide in.</p><p>Sannyas is an unaddressed invitation, to whomsoever it may
concern.</p><p>My observation is that searchers never find him; only the people who
invite him have found him, because invitation means a great task: you
have to transform yourself totally to be worthy to receive. You have to
be loving, you have to be alert, you have to be sensitive, you have to
be creative. You have to drop all kinds of negativities - anger,
jealousy, possessiveness; you have to burn all this rubbish. You have to
drop all your knowledge which is borrowed, you have to be again as
innocent as a child. And then he comes, then he surely comes.</p><p>JUST TAKE A CHAIR AND LEAN BACK</p><p>(Take it easy and he'll easily take you)</p><p>He comes to you only when you are absolutely restful, relaxed, calm,
quiet, when there is no desire, no thought, when you are not asking for
anything, not praying for anything. When you are simply there, in that
simplicity god arrives. Hence my whole message can be condensed as the
art of total relaxation.</p><p>It is not through activity that you will find the truth; in fact it
is continuous activity that is not allowing you to find it. You need
some gaps of interval, some moments when there is no occupation.</p><p>So that is going to be your work, find as many moments as possible
when you can just be. Sit, stand, lie down or walk or swim but do it in
such a way that there is no doer, no doing, no strain. And you will be
surprised that you have found the key -- the key that opens all the
doors of all the mysteries.</p><p>SUN-YES RISE</p><p>(Dhyan means meditation, and Zohra has three meanings, Osho tells
another sannyasin) Meditation is a state of absolute silence. It is not
prayer, because in prayer your mind functions, you are 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>saying something to god, praising the lord. But because you are
saying something the mind is there; without the mind nothing can be
said. And because you are saying something you are not silent even with
god.</p><p>Prayer is a dialogue, and one thing has to be very deeply understood
-- that god understands no language except the language of silence. He
neither understands Sanskrit nor Hebrew nor Arabic nor Latin nor
Greek.</p><p>There are at least three thousand languages on the earth and this is
only one of the planets which is populated. Scientists think at least
fifty thousand planets are</p><p>populated -- that is <em>at least</em>, more are possible.</p><p>This is a very conservative estimate. Three thousand languages on the
earth with at least thirty thousand dialects, and then there are fifty
thousand planets ... if god is to understand language, he will go
crazy.</p><p>God understands only silence. Prayer is the last function of the
mind. Where prayer ends meditation begins, you drop saying anything to
god. What can we say? What have we got to say? Prayer is saying
something, meditation is listening. Rather than saying something to god
it is better to be silent and to listen.</p><p>And in silence the message comes, in silence not only the message but
god himself comes.</p><p>God does not come like a person. He does not come shouting, knocking
on your doors. He comes very silently, like a fragrance, making no
noise. no fuss. God is not a person but a presence.</p><p>A person is bound to be limited. A person can be photographed, an
image can be made of a person. No image can be made of god, for the
simple reason that he is a presence. You can make a beautiful painting
of a rose flower but how will you paint the fragrance of the rose. There
is no way at all. So god is not a person but only a presence, a feeling.
And that feeling wells up from your innermost core when you are utterly
silent, when the mind has gone into complete cessation.</p><p>And Zohra is a beautiful word. It is Arabic, It has three meanings.
One is the blossoming. It is only in deep meditation that one blossoms,
that one comes to one's total unfoldment, otherwise one remains like a
bud. In meditation the petals open. The ultimate opening has been
described by mystic, as a lotus opening.</p><p>And to make it clear that it is a multi-dimensional phenomenon they
have called it a one-thousand petalled lotus. But the lotus opens only
in the morning when the sun rises. The lotus opens only when the
presence of god is felt, the presence of god is just like sunrise for
the soul, hence the other two meanings...</p><p>Zohra also means the dawn, the beginning of the day, the end of the
night; the darkness is over, one has entered into the world of
light.</p><p>And the second meaning is one whose birth is like sunrise. It is not
only that</p><p>god's presence function, like sunrise and your inner being opens up,
it is also a birth for you.</p><p>I have chosen this orange colour for my sannyasins specifically to
represent the colour of the sunrise, when the East becomes orange,
awaiting the sunrise, when it is getting ready to welcome it.</p><p>The moment you come in contact with the presence of god it is a
birth, a new birth. The first birth happened through the parent, the
second birth happens through meditation -- and the first birth is only
physical, the second birth is spiritual</p><p>Sannyas is fulfilled only when the second birth is achieved, when one
is reborn. Jesus says unless you are born again you shall not enter into
my kingdom of god.</p><p>MEDITATION: TURNING YOUR SELF ON</p><p>(The light is inside, we just can't find the switch.)</p><p>We are acquainted with the temporary light, from the light of a
candle to the light of the stars. A candle lasts only a few hours and
the stars last for millions or years, but both are temporary. The
difference is only of quantity, not of quality. The real light -- which
is qualitatively different, which is non-temporal, which never begins
and never ends, which is always there, which has always been there and
will be always there --</p><p>is at the centre of our being.</p><p>Meditation is an enquiry into that inner light. It needs no fuel,
that is why it is eternal, it needs no cause, that's why it is eternal.
We are born with it, and it is really unfortunate that we carry inside
the eternal light and still live in darkness. The foolishness is that we
look outside and the light is inside.</p><p>The whole purpose of a master is to turn you inwards so that you can
see your own light. Once seen it is forever yours and then it transforms
your whole life. The transformation is so big that it is almost
inconceivable unless you have experienced it.</p><p>It is exactly like a blind man suddenly getting eyes: he cannot
imagine what is going to happen when he gets eyes, there is no way for
him to imagine. How can</p><p>he imagine the world of colours? How can he imagine the world of
light, of sun, moon, stars? How can he imagine the world of faces,
beauty? How can 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-4>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>he imagine all this psychedelic existence? Impossible! He did not
even have any idea of darkness, what to say about light?</p><p>The blind man cannot even understand what darkness is, because to
understand darkness you need eyes, without eyes you cannot see even
darkness, so the question of visualising light does not arise at all.
And the same is the situation as far as the inner growth is concerned:
we are are blind.</p><p>The master cannot describe what is going to happen, he can only
persuade you to turn in. Hence there have been many enlightened people
but very few enlightened people ever become masters. That is a totally
different art, the art of seducing people into something which they
cannot even imagine. It is pure salesmanship... and it is selling
invisible things - things which you cannot see! And the price is much:
you have to lose yourself totally for something which you cannot even
see. It needs tremendous trust, it needs a mad love on the part of the
disciple, only then can this miracle happen. But it has happened many
times so it can happen again and again. Be prepared for it!</p><p>You have fallen into the hands of a salesman! And it is not that
first the goods will be delivered and then you go on paying in
instalments. First you have to pay the whole price -- and that means
your whole being.</p><p>And then nobody knows whether you will get anything out of it or not
-- that's the risk! So it is only a game for very adventurous people.
But don't be worried -</p><p>- I will take care!</p><p>SANNYAS: A SHOCKING STATE OF AFFAIRS</p><p>(It's only for lovers, Osho warns Manglam.)</p><p>There are many happy moments in life, many joyous events, but they
are all</p><p>dreamlike; they come quickly and they disappear. When they are there
you feel good, but when they are gone you feel far worse than before
because in the wake you fall into darkness, into a depression.</p><p>So each joy that happens in life brings, almost equal to it,
suffering and agony. In life, joys and sufferings are balanced. There is
no way to change the balance. That's what people go on trying: they go
on trying to do the impossible. They want to have as much joy as
possible and as little suffering as possible.</p><p>But that is against the arithmetic of existence; it will always be
fifty-fifty. You cannot have ninety per cent of joys and ten per cent of
suffering. As you start having more joys, you will have more sufferings
growing together. They always go together, they are like two sides of
the same phenomenon.</p><p>But there is one ecstasy which is without its opposite - that is
called manglam , the ultimate ecstasy.</p><p>Only that is worth achieving because there is no opposite to it. Once
it is yours it transforms your whole being. It is not just a moment that
comes and goes, it becomes your very being. In fact it is already your
very being but you are not conscious of it. It is as if an emperor has
fallen into sleep and is dreaming that he has become a beggar. All that
is needed is not to change the beggar into the emperor; all that is
needed is to shake him so he wakes up. And that's my work here, to shake
you in as many ways possible. And the more you allow me, the more I
shake you.</p><p>Slowly slowly shaking turns into shocking. But I go very slow, I give
you only that much which you can digest - because to wake up a person
who has remained asleep for centuries, for many lives, is not easy work.
He has become accustomed to a sleeping consciousness, he knows nothing
else, so to bring him into the world of wakefulness needs a certain art
- patience, love, a deep compassion.</p><p>Buddha used to say to his disciples that before you become
enlightened at least grow as much compassion as you can. Again and again
he was asked, "Why do you emphasize this?"</p><p>He said, "So that when you become enlightened you have enough
compassion to help people."</p><p>Otherwise many become enlightened but they don't have any compassion.
They are enlightened, they are blissful, they have reached to the
ultimate good - who bothers about others? They will take their own
course. And why interfere in anybody's life? But it is only through
compassion that one takes the risk of interfering.</p><p>And it is risky because whenever you interfere in anybody's sleep he
is going to become angry at you -</p><p>just try to wake up somebody early in the morning when it is cold.
Even though he has said to you to wake him early, he has to catch a
train; he will become angry, he will go through a tantrum, he will think
you are an enemy. There are very few who will be happy about it, and
this is ordinary sleep. Humanity can be divided into two types of
people: one, who likes to wake up early in the morning, and the second -
the rest of us.</p><p>So the work of the master is really difficult because 'the rest of
us' constitutes ninety-nine point nine per cent of humanity. They would
like to pull the blanket over their heads and turn to the other side and
have a 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-5>Osho's books on

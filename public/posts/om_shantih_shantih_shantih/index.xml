‌CHAPTER 1
Sound is our mind – silence is our being
26 February 1988 am in Gautam the Buddha Auditorium
Question 1 BELOVED MASTER,
I AM ALWAYS INTRIGUED BY EASTERN SCRIPTURES THAT BEGIN WITH OM, SHANTIH SHANTIH SHANTIH AND END WITH OM, SHANTIH SHANTIH SHANTIH.
WOULD YOU PLEASE TALK ABOUT THIS?
Maneesha, the East has approached reality in an almost diametrically opposite way to the West.</description>

‌CHAPTER 10
Only reflecting, but not identifying
5 March 1988 am in Gautam the Buddha Auditorium
Question 1 BELOVED MASTER,
MORE AND MORE I SEE HOW MY ENERGY IS EITHER GOING VERY HIGH OR VERY LOW, HOW SOMETIMES I GET VERY EXCITED, COME DOWN AGAIN AND THEN FEEL EMBARRASSED ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED DURING THIS STATE OF EXCITEMENT.
DO YOU HAVE A KNACK TO GIVE ME FOR HOW TO WATCH WHEN THE EXCITEMENT COMES, NOT TO GET CARRIED AWAY AND NOT TO GET IDENTIFIED WITH DEPRESSION, AND HOW TO FIND MY GROUNDING AND BALANCE?</description>

Just don’t be a polack!
5 March 1988 pm in Gautam the Buddha Auditorium
Question 1 BELOVED MASTER,
I READ A POEM OF RUMI THE OTHER DAY WHICH WENT: “MOVE WITHIN, BUT DON’T MOVE THE WAY FEAR MAKES YOU MOVE.”
AROUND THE SAME TIME I AWOKE FROM A DREAM IN TEARS AND ALL I REMEMBERED WAS LOOKING AT MYSELF IN A MIRROR, FACE TO FACE, AND MY EYES WERE FULL OF FEAR.</description>

‌CHAPTER 12
Camels don’t like to go to the mountains
6 March 1988 am in Gautam the Buddha Auditorium
Question 1 BELOVED MASTER,
WHY IS IT THAT THROUGH THE AGES, FILTHY CORRUPTERS, RAPISTS OF THIS BEAUTIFUL PLANET, PEOPLE WHO BETRAY THEIR OWN MOTHER FOR POWER AND WEALTH, ARE GIVEN THE RIGHT TO REGALE THEMSELVES IN SUCH AN OSTENTATIOUS MANNER SO AS TO LIVE FREELY, SO TO SAY, IN THEIR PRESIDENTIAL PALACES OR PRINCELY RETREATS – NOT ONE BUT MANY – AND A MAN OF YOUR LIGHT, HEIGHT AND FAR DEEPER UNDERSTANDING IN EVERY WAY IS PERMITTED ONLY TO BREATHE THIS STINKING, POLLUTED AIR WHICH DOES NOT AT ALL CONTRIBUTE TO YOUR PHYSICAL HEALTH?</description>

‌CHAPTER 13
Be, known thyself, keep the measure
6 March 1988 pm in Gautam the Buddha Auditorium
Question 1 BELOVED MASTER,
WE POOR MODERN GREEKS DON’T KNOW WHAT THE TRUE RELIGION OF OUR ANCESTORS WAS. SO-CALLED SCHOLARS HAVE NO ANSWER AS THEY ARE CONFUSED BY THE RICH MYTHOLOGY OF POETS. HOWEVER, AT DELPHI ONLY THREE ADMONITIONS WERE ENGRAVED ON THE ORIGINAL TEMPLE: BE, KNOW YOURSELF, KEEP THE MEASURE.</description>

7 March 1988 am in Gautam the Buddha Auditorium
Question 1 BELOVED MASTER,
I AM STANDING BEFORE A DOOR ON WHICH IS WRITTEN: MYSTERIES OF EXISTENCE. I OPEN IT AND FIND MYSELF AT YOUR FEET. LOOKING DEEP INTO YOUR EYES, I SEE THAT SUDDENLY THE DOOR IS THERE AGAIN. I OPEN IT AND ONCE MORE, I AM HERE AT YOUR FEET.</description>

‌CHAPTER 15
The three rings of love
7 March 1988 pm in Gautam the Buddha Auditorium
Question 1 BELOVED MASTER,
I REMEMBER YOU SAYING, “DON’T SURRENDER TO A PERSON, SURRENDER TO LOVE.”
I’M IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH A BEAUTIFUL AND POWERFUL WOMAN AND WE BOTH DEFINITELY DON’T WANT TO SURRENDER TO EACH OTHER. WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO SURRENDER TO LOVE WHILE BEING IN RELATIONSHIP?</description>

Having a lovely time – but why?
8 March 1988 am in Gautam the Buddha Auditorium
Question 1 BELOVED MASTER,
IS IT ALWAYS GOOD TO FOLLOW THE HEART OR ONCE IN A WHILE SHOULD A CLEAR MIND DECIDE WHAT IS TO BE DONE? AND WHAT TO DO WHEN THEY WANT TO GO IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS?
Swami Anutosh Pradip, your question is hilarious – to say the least!</description>

‌CHAPTER 17
Almost drunk with emotion
8 March 1988 pm in Gautam the Buddha Auditorium
Question 1 BELOVED MASTER,
SO OFTEN A FEELING THAT I CAN’T DESCRIBE FILLS MY HEART AND MY WHOLE BEING. DURING THE OTHER MORNING’S DISCOURSE IT FELT LIKE OVERWHELMING LOVE FOR YOU AND THE WHOLE. BUT NOW I REALIZE THAT THE SAME FEELING OR A VERY, VERY SIMILAR FEELING ALSO COMES UP IN FEAR, ANGUISH, THROBBING PAIN, HELPLESSNESS AND FRUSTRATION.</description>

‌CHAPTER 18
The mind goes out of employment
9 March 1988 am in Gautam the Buddha Auditorium
Question 1 BELOVED MASTER,
AS FAR BACK AS I CAN REMEMBER FROM MY EARLY CHILDHOOD UNTIL I TOOK SANNYAS, I WAS VERY MUCH SUFFERING FROM THE STRONG FEELING THAT EVERYTHING WAS TOO COMPLICATED. SINCE I MET YOU EIGHT YEARS AGO THINGS HAVE STARTED TO BE SLOWLY, SLOWLY MORE AND MORE SIMPLE.</description>

9 March 1988 pm in Gautam the Buddha Auditorium
Question 1 BELOVED MASTER,
WHY CAN I NOT JUST FALL IN LOVE WITH ANY WOMAN AND BE BLIND LIKE EVERY MAN?
Niskriya, your question is very special. You are asking, “Why can I not just fall in love with any woman and be blind like every man?</description>

An open future with no reverse gear
26 February 1988 pm in Gautam the Buddha Auditorium
Question 1 BELOVED MASTER,
I SEE YOUR ENLIGHTENMENT AS A SPEAKING MEDIUM BETWEEN EXISTENCE AND ALL SANNYASINS – BASED ON LOVE AS THE ONLY TRUE WAY TO GO.
BELOVED MASTER, I’VE HEARD YOU SAY THAT YOU ARE BEYOND ENLIGHTENMENT. WHAT, THEORETICALLY SPEAKING, IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ENLIGHTENMENT AND BEYOND ENLIGHTENMENT?</description>

10 March 1988 am in Gautam the Buddha Auditorium
Question 1 BELOVED MASTER,
I HAVE NEVER BEEN LOVED BY A MAN. EITHER THERE IS A VERY STRONG SEXUAL CONNECTION, BUT WITHOUT LOVINGNESS OR CARING, OR THERE IS CARING AND UNDERSTANDING, BUT SEX DOESN’T HAPPEN. I WANT SO MUCH TO CONNECT WITH A MAN IN TOTALITY THAT I AM ALWAYS LOOKING.</description>

11 March 1988 pm in Gautam the Buddha Auditorium
Question 1 BELOVED MASTER,
THE OTHER NIGHT I HEARD YOU GIVE AN ANSWER TO THE AMERICAN SANNYASIN, DOLMA, IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION ASKED BY ANOTHER DOLMA.
IT SEEMS AS IF IT WAS THE QUESTION DOLMA NEEDED TO ASK, BUT HADN’T, SO YOU HELPED HER TO. YOUR COMPASSION IS SIMPLY STUNNING.</description>

AN OLD SPANISH MYSTIC, SAN JUAN DE LA CRUZ, SYMBOLICALLY DESCRIBED THE SPIRITUAL JOURNEY LIKE A MOUNTAIN, WHICH HE NAMED MONTE CARMELO. IN HIS MYSTIC REPRESENTATION, THE TRAIL BEFORE THE SUMMIT SUDDENLY DISAPPEARS AND HE SPECIFIES: “HERE THERE IS NO TRAIL BECAUSE FOR THE RIGHT MAN THERE IS NO LAW.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED MASTER,
TO MEET THE BUDDHA ON THE WAY AND KILL HIM ALSO IMPLIES THE DEATH OF THE DISCIPLE.
CAN YOU SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE MASTER-DISCIPLE EXPERIENCE AND BEING IN THE PRESENCE OF THE MASTER?
Qadin, Gautama the Buddha is the only master in the whole history of mankind who could assert this tremendously important statement.</description>

I HAVE HEARD YOU SAY THAT THE NATURAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE HUMAN COMMUNITY IS FROM THE TRIBE TO THE FAMILY TO THE COMMUNE – AS A RESULT OF THE UNSTOPPABLE DEMAND FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM.

Question 1 BELOVED MASTER,
WHEN I FIRST SAT IN FRONT OF YOU I HEARD YOU SAY TO ME, “BRING LIGHT INTO THE UNCONSCIOUS.”
EIGHT YEARS HAVE SINCE PASSED AND I FEEL MORE SILENT AND LOVING THAN EVER BEFORE AND YET SENSE THAT THERE IS MUCH MORE.
DOES THE LIGHT WHICH ENTERS THE UNCONSCIOUS COME THROUGH EFFORTS AND DETERMINATION, OR IS IT AN EXISTENTIAL GIFT, REQUIRING PATIENCE, OPENNESS AND RECEPTIVITY?</description>

I HAVE VISITED SOME OF THESE PEOPLE, PARTLY OUT OF CURIOSITY AND PARTLY THROUGH THE RECOMMENDATION OF FRIENDS, AND HAVE FOUND NOTHING THAT COMES EVEN CLOSE TO THE LOVE AND BENEDICTION IN BEING WITH YOU.</description>

4 March 1988 am in Gautam the Buddha Auditorium
Question 1 BELOVED MASTER,
IN A RECENT DISCOURSE YOU GAVE YOUR TOTAL SUPPORT TO GENETIC ENGINEERING. I AM VERY MUCH IN TROUBLE. FOR ME SUCH ENGINEERING IS AGAINST NATURE. WHO SHOULD BE IN CHARGE OF CREATING THAT SUPERMAN? OFTEN A SO-CALLED GENIUS WAS LATER REGARDED AS THE DEVIL. AND PEOPLE LIKE HITLER, STALIN OR REAGAN ARE ONLY POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF ALL THE OTHERS SUPPORTING THEM.</description>

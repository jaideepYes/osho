It is not for ordinarily so-called religious people. It is for those who are authentically devoted, committed to reach to themselves.\nThe statement is very strange in a way, because what it says is exactly what it hides. The statement is: “If you meet me on the way, kill me immediately.”\nAnd the question Qadin is asking is that to kill the master certainly means the death of the disciple.\nQadin you have exactly understood the meaning of Gautam Buddha’s statement. He is saying, “If you meet me on the way, even I don’t matter – the master is the ultimate; even the master does not matter – kill me immediately because I don’t want to become a hindrance on your path. I want to become a stepping stone.”\nBut naturally you can kill the master only if you have killed the disciple first. In fact the master and the disciple are not two words, but two sides of the same coin. Instead of thinking of the master and disciple relationship, look at the point as if master and disciple are two sides of the same coin. And if you drop the coin, both the sides are dropped. The moment the master is killed, how can the disciple survive?\nBut Gautam Buddha could have said, “If you meet me on the way kill the disciple.” That would not have served the purpose, nor would the statement have been meaningful. That is exactly what he wants, but the only way to kill the disciple is to kill the master. The only way is to disappear together and just leave the energy searching and seeking the paradise lost, as one whole.\nOrdinarily people have always understood that the master and disciple relationship is just like other relationships: the wife and husband, the teacher and the taught. It is not of the same category; it is a very strange relationship. It is as if in two bodies one heart starts throbbing. You cannot call it relationship, because relationship needs out of necessity the existence of the two, and this phenomenon of master and disciple intrinsically needs the disappearance of duality.\nGautam Buddha is immensely compassionate. Rather than telling you, “Disappear,” rather than telling you, “Drop your ego, be no more of a separate entity,” he has found a very subtle way of saying the same thing, but in a far more sophisticated way: “Kill me, if you meet me on the way.”\nIn meditation, when you are moving inwards, you will meet many things. You will meet your repressed desires, you will meet your incomplete experiences, you will meet your ambitions, but it is easy to destroy them, it is easy to go beyond them. Finally you will meet your master, because that is your last love. You have left everything for him, now only the master has remained. But even that small clinging is enough to prevent your eyes from seeing the truth.\nIn another statement Gautam Buddha has said – and you may wonder how such a small clinging can prevent the immense truth from being seen – “Just a small particle of sand in your eyes is enough to prevent you from seeing the whole sky.” It is not a question of a small piece of sand, it is a question of your vision. Your vision is closed, your vision is very small. The world, the truth, the universe is immense, but your eyes... And the master is certainly the biggest experience of your life. He overwhelms you, he throbs in your nerves, he dances in your heart, he thrills every cell of your being. If you don’t drop him you will not be able to know the infinite and the eternal.\nBut the moment you drop the master, certainly you are no longer a disciple; they disappear together. What remains is utter silence, a non-dual state of tranquility.\nNo other master in the world has been able to pinpoint it so clearly and in such a sophisticated way that you never think he is asking you to dissolve. You start thinking he is asking you to kill him. He will certainly meet you on the path. He will meet you only at the last, when all other attachments and relationships are gone. He will meet you and it is going to be hard. It is going to be very hard to kill your own master. But it is only a metaphor, it only indicates to say good-bye to Gautam Buddha: “You have been enough for me, now leave me alone. Just move out of the way.”\nI will not tell you to kill. Gautam Buddha was a warrior, trained as a prince in swordsmanship. He talks the same language: “If you meet me on the way, kill me immediately.”\nI don’t even know how to hold the sword so I cannot say that. What to say of a sword? I have never even touched a razor blade with my hands.\nI don’t think you will find anybody in the world who has an original beard. I have never cut... but everybody in my family was continuously telling me... I said, “I love originality so much that even if nothing is original in me, at least it can be non-controversially said that my beard is original.”\nSo I cannot say to you, “When I meet you, kill me.” That very word ‘kill’ – it was perfectly good for a prince but I will simply say, “When you meet me just say good-bye.” More than that is not needed. Unnecessary killing and bloodshed and I have so many disciples, if everybody starts killing me, how many times will I be killed? No, that is too much; good-bye is perfectly mannerly. Nobody can object about its beauty and grace.\nAnd remember, to say good-bye is more difficult than to kill, because when you say good-bye your eyes will be full of tears, your heart will be weeping. As far as killing is concerned that is very simple, non-complicated. A single blow and the poor master is dead. And then you will be surprised that it is not only the poor master who is dead, but with the poor master you are also dead. He was your life – you have committed suicide!\nBut these words ‘killing’ and ‘suicide’ are not very poetic. I say, “When you meet me on the path, say gracefully, without tears in your eyes, ‘Good-bye’ – and don’t look back.”\nNaturally you will also disappear. What remains is the pure existence.\nWe are simply waves in the pure existence and its ocean. When the wave disappears nothing disappears.…\nA curve is simply no more.\nA curve has become a straight line.\nNobody dies and nobody disappears. Existence remains the same through all the changes, through all the climates, through all the forms, through all the seasons, through life, through birth, through death.\nYou should not take it very seriously.…\nOne Christian monk said to me, “This seems to be very strange that a man who taught non-violence for his whole life says, ‘If I meet you on the way kill me.’”\nThe Christian monk was in a way right, because the word ‘killing’ does not give you the sense of compassion and love. But he did not understand that as far as Gautam Buddha or people like Krishna are concerned, nothing is killed. Only the form is dissolved into a new form. You cannot destroy anything in this world, you can only change, and change is continuously happening.\nIt is good that you accept this change as the very nature of existence, and with it drop all resistance and change with a deep surrender, let-go.\nDon’t even swim downstream, just flow. Wherever the stream is going is home.\nAnd Qadin, you are also asking what it means “being in the presence of the master?”\nIt means to be absent as yourself and let the master’s presence surround you, penetrate you, burn you, change you, transform you. You drop all defense, you drop all distance, you drop all fear; you simply melt and merge in the energy that surrounds the master. That is what is meant to be in the presence of the master.\nEverybody who is present is not present in the sense that I am telling you to be present. You can be present as yourself for years and nothing will happen, and you can be present the way I am telling you just for a single moment – and you will be reborn.\nThe presence of the master is a fire in which you have to be burned, but whatever is gold will remain and whatever is not gold will be burned. To be twenty-four carat gold is a sheer joy. Utter purity like a flower will start surrounding you. A new energy that you had not known, although it is your own but has been asleep, dormant, becomes radiant. You start to glow in a new style of life and love, in a new way you dance and sing and celebrate.\nIf the master’s presence does not become a dance in you, you have not been present, you must have been somewhere else.\nI have told you the story...\nTwo friends were talking. One friend said, “You will not be able to believe that last night in my dream I went fishing. My God, what a great fish, so huge. The whole night I was fishing and fishing and there was no end... greater and greater fish...!”\nThe other man said, “This is nothing. What I saw last night you will certainly not believe. I saw that on one side Marilyn Monroe is lying naked and on the other side another beauty.”\nAs he asserted this the first man said, “You idiot. You pretend to be my best friend. Why did you not call me?”\nThe man said, “I did. I went running to your house, and your wife told me that you had gone fishing!”\nNobody is where he thinks he is. You think you are here? Really, you think...? If you look within yourself you may not believe it. It is strange, you are here and your mind is wandering somewhere else, is thinking about something else.\nTo be in the presence of a master is not to be just physically present. It has to be a presence of consciousness, of awareness, as if the whole world has disappeared. Only this moment – and you are gripped by a great silence. Out of this silence will arise the dance, the celebration.\nOne of the most important disciples of Gautam Buddha was Mahakashyapa. It is strange that he is rarely mentioned in Buddhist scriptures. As far as I know he is mentioned only once. There were\nother great disciples, Sariputta, Mandgalyan, Ananda and many more, and they are mentioned thousands of times. There are so many incidents in which they are involved.\nMahakashyapa is mentioned only once, because his first encounter with Gautam Buddha was his last. He looked into his eyes, he touched his feet and he sat by the side. And for forty years he was simply rejoicing, celebrating. People used to think that he was somewhat crazy: “Why does he go on smiling? Nobody has said anything, nothing has happened and he is smiling as if somebody has cracked a joke...?”\nHe was asked and he said, “What more...? I have seen the greatest height of consciousness. I have seen the purest love. I have seen the silence that is eternal, and I am utterly satisfied. Out of that satisfaction comes my smile. I am not smiling at somebody else. My smile is just like a flower. It is not flowering for you. It is just the juice of the bush that is blossoming in the flower. Because I am so full of my master’s presence, flowers go on blossoming.”\nTo be in the presence of the master is to disappear as a separate entity. It is just like the dropping of a dewdrop from the lotus leaf into the ocean – not that the dewdrop disappears, it simply becomes the ocean.\nNow something serious. I really mean serious. Niskriya, awake! He was falling asleep.…\nFarmer Rumple is getting on in years, but the pretty young wench who milks his cows catches his eye.\nHe decides to marry her and they settle down happily at the farmhouse. Some time later, Farmer Rumple goes to visit his doctor.\n“I have this problem,” he says. “I don’t get the urge very often, but sometimes it happens when I’m out in the fields, and by the time I run back to my wife at the farmhouse, it is gone!”\n“Well,” says the doctor, thoughtfully, “why don’t you take your gun with you, so when you get the urge, you can fire off a shot and she can come running to you?”\n“Great idea!” says Rumple and goes home.\nAll is well until one day the doctor sees the farmer looking a bit miserable. “How is your love life?” asks the doctor.\n“It was wonderful since you gave me that advice,” says Rumple. “And how is your lovely wife?” asks the doctor.\n“Well,” replies Rumple, “that is just it. I have hardly seen her at all since the hunting season started!”\nA psychology professor is teaching a class, and tells his students that he is going to conduct a sex survey. He says to the class, “If you have sex once a day, raise your hand.”\nAbout fifteen percent of the students raise their hands. “Okay,” he continues; “if you have sex three times a week, raise your hand.”\nAbout forty percent do so.\n“Interesting,” he says. “If you have sex once a week, raise your hand.” About twenty percent do so.\nThe professor then asks, “If you have sex once a month, raise your hand.”\nA few hands go up. Then as an afterthought he says, “If you have sex once a year, raise your hand.” A little guy at the back of the class waves wildly, grinning from ear to ear.\n“Why are you so happy?” asks the professor.\nThe little guy jumps up and starts to dance with joy, singing, “Tonight’s the night!”\nJack and Ida Blinkoff, an old retired couple, are taking their yearly winter vacation, driving from New York City to Florida.\nJack is driving with Ida sitting beside him giving instructions. As they are passing through Virginia, they are pulled over by a traffic cop.\nThe officer says to Jack, “You realize that you were exceeding the speed limit, don’t you?” Ida nudges Jack and asks, “What did he say?”\n“He is telling me that I was speeding,” replies Jack.\nThen the cop asks Jack to present his driver’s license and registration. “What did he say?” asks Ida.\n“He wants to see my license, dear,” replies Jack.\nSeeing that they are from New York, the officer remarks, “I have been to New York. That is where I had the worst screw of my life!”\n“What did he say?” asks Ida.\nCoolly, Jack replies, “He says, dear, that he thinks he knows you!” Niskriya, are you awake now? Just to be on the safe side...\nThere is great excitement in the cannibal tribe when a white hunter and his beautiful girlfriend are brought into the village and tied up to a tree.\nThe cannibals boil up a huge pot of water and the man is thrown in, cooked, and served up for a great feast.\nBy dawn the next morning, another pot is boiling, and the cannibals untie the girl and lead her towards it. She is just about to be thrown in when a man comes running from the chief’s hut.\n“Wait!” cries the man, “Wait! The chief wants his breakfast in bed!” Okay, Maneesha?\nYes, Beloved Master.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2739","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/om_shantih_shantih_shantih/part23/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/om_shantih_shantih_shantih/>Om Shantih Shantih Shantih</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">23 When you meet me just say good-bye</h1><div class=post-meta>13 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2739 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Om_Shantih_Shantih_Shantih/part23.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part22>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

hands.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t think you will find anybody in the world who has an original
beard. I have never cut... but everybody in my family was continuously
telling me... I said, “I love originality so much that even if nothing
is original in me, at least it can be non-controversially said that my
beard is original.”</p><p><br></p><p>So I cannot say to you, “When I meet you, kill me.” That very word
‘kill’ – it was perfectly good for a prince but I will simply say, “When
you meet me just say good-bye.” More than that is not needed.
Unnecessary killing and bloodshed and I have so many disciples, if
everybody starts killing me, how many times will I be killed? No, that
is too much; good-bye is perfectly mannerly. Nobody can object about its
beauty and grace.</p><p><br></p><p>And remember, to say good-bye is more difficult than to kill, because
when you say good-bye your eyes will be full of tears, your heart will
be weeping. As far as killing is concerned that is very simple,
non-complicated. A single blow and the poor master is dead. And then you
will be surprised that it is not only the poor master who is dead, but
with the poor master you are also dead. He was your life – you have
committed suicide!</p><p><br></p><p>But these words ‘killing’ and ‘suicide’ are not very poetic. I say,
“When you meet me on the path, say gracefully, without tears in your
eyes, ‘Good-bye’ – and don’t look back.”</p><p><br></p><p>Naturally you will also disappear. What remains is the pure
existence.</p><p><br></p><p>We are simply waves in the pure existence and its ocean. When the
wave disappears nothing disappears.…</p><p><br></p><p>A curve is simply no more.</p><p><br></p><p>A curve has become a straight line.</p><p><br></p><p>Nobody dies and nobody disappears. Existence remains the same through
all the changes, through all the climates, through all the forms,
through all the seasons, through life, through birth, through death.</p><p><br></p><p>You should not take it very seriously.…</p><p><br></p><p>One Christian monk said to me, “This seems to be very strange that a
man who taught non-violence for his whole life says, ‘If I meet you on
the way kill me.’”</p><p><br></p><p>The Christian monk was in a way right, because the word ‘killing’
does not give you the sense of compassion and love. But he did not
understand that as far as Gautam Buddha or people like Krishna are
concerned, nothing is killed. Only the form is dissolved into a new
form. You cannot destroy anything in this world, you can only change,
and change is continuously happening.</p><p><br></p><p>It is good that you accept this change as the very nature of
existence, and with it drop all resistance and change with a deep
surrender, let-go.</p><p>Don’t even swim downstream, just flow. Wherever the stream is going
is home.</p><p>And Qadin, you are also asking what it means “being in the presence
of the master?”</p><p><br></p><p>It means to be absent as yourself and let the master’s presence
surround you, penetrate you, burn you, change you, transform you. You
drop all defense, you drop all distance, you drop all fear; you simply
melt and merge in the energy that surrounds the master. That is what is
meant to be in the presence of the master.</p><p><br></p><p>Everybody who is present is not present in the sense that I am
telling you to be present. You can be present as yourself for years and
nothing will happen, and you can be present the way I am telling you
just for a single moment – and you will be reborn.</p><p><br></p><p>The presence of the master is a fire in which you have to be burned,
but whatever is gold will remain and whatever is not gold will be
burned. To be twenty-four carat gold is a sheer joy. Utter purity like a
flower will start surrounding you. A new energy that you had not known,
although it is your own but has been asleep, dormant, becomes radiant.
You start to glow in a new style of life and love, in a new way you
dance and sing and celebrate.</p><p><br></p><p>If the master’s presence does not become a dance in you, you have not
been present, you must have been somewhere else.</p><p><br></p><p>I have told you the story...</p><p><br></p><p>Two friends were talking. One friend said, “You will not be able to
believe that last night in my dream I went fishing. My God, what a great
fish, so huge. The whole night I was fishing and fishing and there was
no end... greater and greater fish...!”</p><p><br></p><p>The other man said, “This is nothing. What I saw last night you will
certainly not believe. I saw that on one side Marilyn Monroe is lying
naked and on the other side another beauty.”</p><p><br></p><p>As he asserted this the first man said, “You idiot. You pretend to be
my best friend. Why did you not call me?”</p><p><br></p><p>The man said, “I did. I went running to your house, and your wife
told me that you had gone fishing!”</p><p><br></p><p>Nobody is where he thinks he is. You think you are here? Really, you
think...? If you look within yourself you may not believe it. It is
strange, you are here and your mind is wandering somewhere else, is
thinking about something else.</p><p><br></p><p>To be in the presence of a master is not to be just physically
present. It has to be a presence of consciousness, of awareness, as if
the whole world has disappeared. Only this moment – and you are gripped
by a great silence. Out of this silence will arise the dance, the
celebration.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the most important disciples of Gautam Buddha was
Mahakashyapa. It is strange that he is rarely mentioned in Buddhist
scriptures. As far as I know he is mentioned only once. There were</p><p>other great disciples, Sariputta, Mandgalyan, Ananda and many more,
and they are mentioned thousands of times. There are so many incidents
in which they are involved.</p><p><br></p><p>Mahakashyapa is mentioned only once, because his first encounter with
Gautam Buddha was his last. He looked into his eyes, he touched his feet
and he sat by the side. And for forty years he was simply rejoicing,
celebrating. People used to think that he was somewhat crazy: “Why does
he go on smiling? Nobody has said anything, nothing has happened and he
is smiling as if somebody has cracked a joke...?”</p><p><br></p><p>He was asked and he said, “What more...? I have seen the greatest
height of consciousness. I have seen the purest love. I have seen the
silence that is eternal, and I am utterly satisfied. Out of that
satisfaction comes my smile. I am not smiling at somebody else. My smile
is just like a flower. It is not flowering for you. It is just the juice
of the bush that is blossoming in the flower. Because I am so full of my
master’s presence, flowers go on blossoming.”</p><p><br></p><p>To be in the presence of the master is to disappear as a separate
entity. It is just like the dropping of a dewdrop from the lotus leaf
into the ocean – not that the dewdrop disappears, it simply becomes the
ocean.</p><p><br></p><p>Now something serious. I really mean serious. Niskriya, awake! He was
falling asleep.…</p><p><br></p><p>Farmer Rumple is getting on in years, but the pretty young wench who
milks his cows catches his eye.</p><p><br></p><p>He decides to marry her and they settle down happily at the
farmhouse. Some time later, Farmer Rumple goes to visit his doctor.</p><p>“I have this problem,” he says. “I don’t get the urge very often, but
sometimes it happens when I’m out in the fields, and by the time I run
back to my wife at the farmhouse, it is gone!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well,” says the doctor, thoughtfully, “why don’t you take your gun
with you, so when you get the urge, you can fire off a shot and she can
come running to you?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Great idea!” says Rumple and goes home.</p><p><br></p><p>All is well until one day the doctor sees the farmer looking a bit
miserable. “How is your love life?” asks the doctor.</p><p>“It was wonderful since you gave me that advice,” says Rumple. “And
how is your lovely wife?” asks the doctor.</p><p>“Well,” replies Rumple, “that is just it. I have hardly seen her at
all since the hunting season started!”</p><p><br></p><p>A psychology professor is teaching a class, and tells his students
that he is going to conduct a sex survey. He says to the class, “If you
have sex once a day, raise your hand.”</p><p>About fifteen percent of the students raise their hands. “Okay,” he
continues; “if you have sex three times a week, raise your hand.”</p><p><br></p><p>About forty percent do so.</p><p><br></p><p>“Interesting,” he says. “If you have sex once a week, raise your
hand.” About twenty percent do so.</p><p>The professor then asks, “If you have sex once a month, raise your
hand.”</p><p><br></p><p>A few hands go up. Then as an afterthought he says, “If you have sex
once a year, raise your hand.” A little guy at the back of the class
waves wildly, grinning from ear to ear.</p><p>“Why are you so happy?” asks the professor.</p><p><br></p><p>The little guy jumps up and starts to dance with joy, singing,
“Tonight’s the night!”</p><p><br></p><p>Jack and Ida Blinkoff, an old retired couple, are taking their yearly
winter vacation, driving from New York City to Florida.</p><p><br></p><p>Jack is driving with Ida sitting beside him giving instructions. As
they are passing through Virginia, they are pulled over by a traffic
cop.</p><p><br></p><p>The officer says to Jack, “You realize that you were exceeding the
speed limit, don’t you?” Ida nudges Jack and asks, “What did he
say?”</p><p>“He is telling me that I was speeding,” replies Jack.</p><p><br></p><p>Then the cop asks Jack to present his driver’s license and
registration. “What did he say?” asks Ida.</p><p>“He wants to see my license, dear,” replies Jack.</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing that they are from New York, the officer remarks, “I have been
to New York. That is where I had the worst screw of my life!”</p><p><br></p><p>“What did he say?” asks Ida.</p><p><br></p><p>Coolly, Jack replies, “He says, dear, that he thinks he knows you!”
Niskriya, are you awake now? Just to be on the safe side...</p><p>There is great excitement in the cannibal tribe when a white hunter
and his beautiful girlfriend are brought into the village and tied up to
a tree.</p><p>The cannibals boil up a huge pot of water and the man is thrown in,
cooked, and served up for a great feast.</p><p><br></p><p>By dawn the next morning, another pot is boiling, and the cannibals
untie the girl and lead her towards it. She is just about to be thrown
in when a man comes running from the chief’s hut.</p><p><br></p><p>“Wait!” cries the man, “Wait! The chief wants his breakfast in bed!”

Krishna is one of the incarnations of god. The Hindu concept of god coming to earth is not like the Christian – not that god has only one son, not that god only comes in one form, as Christ: god comes in many forms, god comes in every age. God comes in every country, every time, because god is not yet in a state of becoming careless towards man, and will never be."><meta name=author content="Osho"><link rel=canonical href=https://osho.lol/posts/dont_look_before_you_leap/part27/><meta name=google-site-verification content="XYZabc"><meta name=yandex-verification content="XYZabc"><meta name=msvalidate.01 content="XYZabc"><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.b609c58d5c11bb90b1a54e04005d74ad1ddf22165eb79f5533967e57df9c3b50.css integrity="sha256-tgnFjVwRu5CxpU4EAF10rR3fIhZet59VM5Z+V9+cO1A=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=mask-icon href=https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://osho.lol/posts/dont_look_before_you_leap/part27/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:title" content="27"><meta property="og:description" content="< Previous | Contents | Next >

The Hindu concept of god coming to earth is not like the Christian – not that god has only one son, not that god only comes in one form, as Christ: god comes in many forms, god comes in every age. God comes in every country, every time, because god is not yet in a state of becoming careless towards man, and will never be. God still hopes that man can be redeemed, that man is not a hopeless case, so god comes again and again.\nAnd whenever there is enlightenment, god takes possession of the enlightened person, because the enlightened person is not a person at all; he is just emptiness. And only in that emptiness can god take possession. So whenever there is this emptiness, whenever the ego disappears, god immediately appears. These are two aspects of the same phenomenon: the ego disappearing and god appearing; the death of the ego is the birth of god.\nSo in India we have many incarnations of god. Every enlightened person is a god person. His own personality is gone. Now he is just a hollow bamboo, and god can make a flute out of him and can sing his song. And one of the best songs that he has sung is through Krishna... one of the most beautiful, most enchanting.\nThe very word ‘krishna’ means enchanting, that which attracts, magical, that which is like a magnet and by which people’s hearts are suddenly moved.\nAnd Krishna is also one of the most affirmative expressions of god.\nJesus is a little sad. And who knows? – Christians may be right; they say he never laughed. At least in the way they have depicted him he seems to be completely incapable of laughter. He may have laughed, but the story that has come through the Christians is not of a laughing Christ, and you\ncannot think of him as dancing. Somehow they have made him fit with the cross. He looks perfectly made for it; the sadness, the heaviness, the seriousness, go perfectly well with the cross.\nKrishna goes perfectly well with the flute, with flowers around his neck, with beautiful clothes – the clothes of a dancer, with ornaments on his body and with a throne, with all the grandeur, with a crown made of peacock feathers... utterly beautiful, utterly affirmative.\nThe message is that religion should be a matter of dance, laughter, love. It should not be serious. It should be light – it should not be grave. It should be capable of loving this world and of affirming life, not negating it.\n[The new sannyasin says: I feel as if you know mebut it’s very strange.]\nIt is, but strange things are possible in life. Life is so full of strange things – things which one cannot believe but which one has to believe because they happen, things which are incredible. If somebody else tells them to you, you will not believe them, but when they happen to you, you have to believe. And that’s why life has value: it is a constant surprise, you can never exhaust it, and each moment something turns up which you had never expected, never dreamed about.\nLife takes such sudden turns – unexpected, unpredictable. That’s the beauty of it. That proves it is not mechanical. That proves it is something more than a mechanical existence. It is not repetitive. And strange things are the only proofs that god must be, because strange things cannot be explained by reason, cannot be explained away by reason. Reason simply stumbles over strange things and is at a loss.\nIn those moments when reason is at a loss something of the beyond penetrates you. And the man is fortunate who comes across such moments more often. And if you become available to such strange spaces, they will come more often, they will happen more. In fact they have always been happening but you were not aware. We only see that for which we are on the alert. We go on missing much just because we are not looking for it!\nScientists say we only see two percent of life; ninety-eight percent is simply passed over. And in that ninety-eight-percent is all that is beautiful, all that is beyond comprehension, all that is strange and mysterious. What we see, the two percent, is nothing but utilitarian – concerned with bread and butter... small things: the house, the family, the relationship. Sooner or later one settles into a certain pattern and then goes on revolving in the same pattern for the whole of life, and dies.\nRemain available to these strange things – invite them. And when they happen, don’t be in a hurry to dissect them and don’t be in a hurry to find some explanation for them. Wait! There are not explanations for each and everything. And the things which have no explanations are the real things. They are the doors – they take you into the unknown\nAnd the things which have explanations are ordinary. Things that can be reduced to knowledge are just mundane, and things which are elusive and go on slipping out of your hands, are mercurial, like mercury, they are the real things. Follow them – wherever they lead you go with them, trust them, and you will never be a loser.\nPrem means love, rajo means the secret – the secret of love, or love, the secret. Love is the greatest secret there is, and if one can discover it, one has discovered an inexhaustible treasure. It is oceanic. One can go on and on. It begins but it never ends; it has a beginning but no end.\nOn the path of love, many things happen of their own accord. It is not the path of effort. The path of love is the path of surrender. You don’t do much – rather, on the contrary, you simply allow yourself to be available for things to happen. You are in a receptive passivity.\nThe path of effort is to be active, to be searching, to be seeking. Some way or other ego is involved in it – it is an ego trip. On the path of love one surrenders. One is not even to search or seek. One waits... one is patient, and whenever the time is ripe, things start happening. Love is trust that it is going to happen if one can wait enough.\nOn the path of love many things grow. Prayer grows... without any effort. The lover comes to know about prayer not through any scripture, not from the church. Those prayers that come from the scriptures and the church are going to be pseudo, false, because they have not grown out of your heart. They are plastic. You have purchased them in the market. They are not real flowers. That is not the way of growing real flowers. One has to become the soil. Roses come but one has to become the manure. One has to die for those roses to come. On the path of love, prayer grows. Suddenly one day you find that the rose is blooming, it has bloomed, and you are full of the fragrance. And that fragrance is always new. It is not the prayer that Jesus did or Krishna did. It will be your prayer – it will come out of your being; it will have your colour, your form, it will have your signature on it. It will be authentic.\nOn the path of love celebration grows of its own accord, and dancing and singing, and life is no more a struggle but a let-go. And there are things which happen only when you are in a let-go. All that is great happens only when you are in a let-go. If you are in an effort to conquer, you will conquer only small things.\nConquerors can become at the most Adolf Hitlers, Napoleons or Alexanders. They never become Buddhas – they cannot. To become a Buddha or to become a Christ, one has to be not in the mood of conquering at all, but, on the contrary, to be conquered by god one has to be feminine. That is the secret of love: to be feminine, to be passive, to be open, vulnerable, ready to absorb, ready to be pregnant, just to be a womb, and all that is needed comes. That’s what I call trust – that it comes; whenever your real need is there, it comes. It never comes by your search. It comes only when your real need is there. When you are really thirsty, your thirst will be quenched.\nThat’s what Jesus means when he says ‘Knock and the door shall be opened unto you. Ask and it shall be given. Seek and ye shall find.’ But by ‘seeking’ he does not mean an active search, because he says ‘The kingdom of god is within you.’ How can you seek it actively? Where can you go to search for it? There is nowhere to go. One has to relax into oneself. The seeking has to be passive, the knocking has to be passive. It has to be a kind of prayer in love.\n[The new sannyasin asks how to accept that she is not close to OshoIt takes so much effort.]\nBut you will be close! It takes a little time.…\nEffort will not bring you close to me. Effort is the thing that is keeping you distant. Drop the effort! Just be in a loving space, that’s all; be in a prayerful space, that’s all... and you will come closer and closer. It is not a question of your having to come closer. You are; it is just that your effort is not allowing you to see that fact. You are so concerned, so worried about being close that you can’t see the fact that you are close. Your whole mine is focussed on how to be closer so it can happen. You can go on searching for something which was just around the corner.\nCloseness is not a thing that can be achieved by effort. The distance or closeness are not spatial, not in space; they are inner. One can be close to me thousands of miles away physically, and one can be distant just sitting in front of me. So it is not a question of space or time. It is a question of seeing what is the case. From my side I am very close to you. From your side you are still making efforts, and your efforts are your undoing.\nDrop the efforts and just enjoy being with me. Forget about closeness, etcetera. Just enjoy. Be happy that you are with me, and suddenly you will see that all the distance has disappeared.\n[A sannyasin says he has doubts about being a sannyasin because he just wants to do a little meditation, be with his children – not striving to make something special of his life.]\nIt is not special at all. Sannyas is exactly that: to live a very ordinary life. These clothes and this mala are just to remind you so that you don’t forget, that you have to live a very ordinary life. One tends to forget. The ego comes in again and again and starts being special. The ego is so clever that it can even try to be absolutely ordinary so that one becomes extraordinary.\nIt can even hide behind the so-called ordinariness. It can say ‘Look! I live a very ordinary life. Nobody lives such an ordinary life. Everybody is after being somebody special. I am not!’ But it is finished – the ego has come in!\nThese clothes, your love for me, your relationship to me, is just to remind you how cunning the ego is. And they are a protection. You are still in a space where the ego can destroy you; this is a protection. And this idea comes to many people. They think ‘Now, meditation is going well, things are feeling good, so what is the need of sannyas?’ They don’t understand that the more things are going well, the more is the need, because the more you become soft, vulnerable, open, the more protection you will need.\nOtherwise you can be easily destroyed by small things that are always there like seeds in the mind. Once you forget about meditation, about me, about sannyas, those small things Like seeds will sprout again and become big trees. The seeds are not yet burned. It may be just that those seeds are playing a trick upon you.\nSo be ordinary – there is no problem in it; that’s how one should be. Live the ordinary life of eating, sleeping, taking care of your children, loving. Don’t make anything special of yourself. But this is precisely what sannyas is! Sannyas is not something special.\nAnd doubts are expected. They will always be coming; until the mind is dissolved totally doubts will go on coming. They will come less and less but they will come. And then there are moods when you are flowing, when you are happy; doubts are less. When you are not flowing and you come into\na valley part, dark part, doubts are more. It is like in the day, fear disappears, everything is clear. In the night, in the same room, all is dark and the fear comes back. Doubts always come when you are more unconscious, trust always when you are more conscious.\nThe totally conscious man is absolutely trustful. You can go on deceiving him but he will not doubt you – he cannot; it is simply not possible. He will not find anything that can bring the doubt back. You can kill him but he will die in deep trust.\nIt happened... there is a very famous Tibetan story: A young man came and surrendered to a master, but the master was a bogus one, just a pretender. But the disciple’s surrender was so tremendously total that he achieved. The master was bogus, the master knew nothing, but the disciple’s surrender was total, his trust was total, and miracles started happening in the disciple’s life. Even the master was surprised because he could not believe it – he himself could not do such things! The disciple was doing things: he was walking on water! The master himself tried, thinking ‘If my disciple can walk on water, then why not I ? Maybe I have not tried it yet.’ He asked the disciple ‘What do you do?’\nThe disciple said ‘But what is there to do? I just simply remember you! I remember your name and everything is possible. I have passed through fire and I was not burned; I have walked on water; I have jumped from the mountain cliff and I was not hurt. Just your name! And you know it – why are you asking me?’\nThe master tried but he nearly drowned. He tried saying his own name, he tried to remember himself, but he was afraid; doubt was there. He could not believe that this was possible – just repeating his name?\nSo it is not a question of whom you are with. The greater question is: how much trust? But one cannot force trust. If you force, those doubts remain repressed and they will come back; so rather than forcing trust, watch those doubts, become aware. Observe them, take note that they are there, but don’t be trapped by them, don’t be overpowered by them.\nBuddhists have a technique for it. They say: when doubt comes, repeat inside ‘Doubt, doubt’... and watch. Whenever doubt comes repeat twice ‘Doubt, doubt’ and watch. You are the witness and the doubt is there – and you have named it doubt; just watch. You have labelled it. And slowly slowly you will see that if you are not identified with the doubts, they come less and less and one day they disappear. That day is a day of great liberation when all doubts disappear and only trust is left. That trust will give you all that your life contains in itself. It will give you the whole world.\nSo the idea is good – remain ordinary, but don’t make much fuss about it, mm? Enjoy it and continue to meditate.\n[The sannyasin then says he doesn’t feel like doing groups.] That s the doubt.\nI am not saying to you to go into fire and I am not saying to walk on water and I am not saying ‘Jump from the cliff, off the mountain.’ Just think if I say ‘Jump from the cliff, off the mountain!’ I am just saying do a few groups, and the ‘no’ comes.\nThe I is too strong – ‘I don’t feel like it.’ If you have not done any groups what right have you to...?\nYou have never done them, so how can you have some idea of whether to do them or not, or whether they will be helpful or not?... Then why do you decide so absolutely and so easily ? Why do you allow the no to come? You could have said to me ‘If they are helpful, I will do them.’ But you cannot even ask that.\nAnd you think you will be able to live an ordinary; life! You say that these doubts are there and you ask how to drop them... but you have been nourishing them.Nourishing them, nurturing them,\nfeeding them.\nIt is up to you. Just be here.\n[A sannyasin says that deep inside he always feels sad. Osho checks his energy.]\nNothing to be worried about. It is not really sadness – you are just becoming less excited, and that’s good. It can appear to be like sadness. Many things are so similar that one can get confused.\nIf a man has always lived with excitement and then it leaves, he feels like falling into sadness. But it is perfectly good. Your fever is disappearing; you are becoming more still, more calm. Don’t call it sadness. It is just the silence that comes after the storm.and more silence will be coming.\nIf you call it sadness you have already taken an anti attitude towards it. In calling it sadness you have already condemned it, and you will hold yourself back. You will try to do something so that you are not sad. But it is not sadness at all – it is just a meditative stillness, something immensely valuable. Only later on will you be able to see the point of it.when it has come to its full flowering.\nIt is just as if a man has always lived with fever and then he becomes healthy, the fever disappears. He will think ‘What is happening? I am losing my energy, my heat, my life. I am becoming cold. Am I dying or something?’ All that is happening is that the fever is leaving him – he is becoming healthier. It’s perfectly good.\n[A sannyasin couple have just arrived from the West. Osho had told them to live separately. Osho checks their energy, and says there is no need for them to separate. But give each other as much space as possible, for they love each other deeply and a love of that intensity needs a break. Mini- divorces every day mean there need never be a real divorce. Love is like food, says Osho, and if you go on stuffing yourself with chocolates and with goodies all day long, you’ll never experience real hunger. Love is a food.a goodie, beware of it – don’t go on stuffing.]\n[Another couple are in conflict. The man says when he is with his partner he feels surrendered to her and its tremendous, but often he needs a few days away from her, and she does not like this.]\n(To the man) Simply listen to your feelings. When you feel flowing, flow; when you don’t feel flowing there is no need to force it. Don’t create unnecessary problems for yourself. And she is perfectly ready to allow you that much space; there is no problem from her side. But be true: whenever you are feeling flowing, flow. Don’t play a politician. In times when you want to be with her – as she is saying – you say no, but she feels that you want to say yes. Don’t play the politician. If you want to\nsay yes, say yes; if you want to say no, say no. Because women are very perceptive. If deep down you want to say yes and on the surface you are saying no, she will be able to feel it. They have a deeper sensitivity to feel, they are intuitive. It is very difficult to deceive a woman, and she is almost always right.\nSo there is no need... when you love a woman, simply be true. Don’t play this male chauvinistic game. The male mind is such that even when it wants the woman to be close, it says no, because it wants to pretend ‘I don’t need anybody. I am enough unto myself. If you want me, you can come, but I don’t need you.’ That is foolish – you cannot deceive a woman – and that unnecessarily creates complexity. Life as it is is complicated enough; don’t make it more complicated. Make it as simple as possible. If there is yes, then yes; if there is no, there is no. Don’t create confusion. And she will be able – she loves you – she will be able to understand it when you want to say no; she will not feel offended.\nTruth never really offends. To be true to a person is really being respectful to the person. If you are not respectful then you have to be diplomatic. Then you have to play; you have to use games and strategies. But when you love a person simply sayAnd it is not in any way condemning her; when\nyou want to be alone it says nothing about her. It doesn’t say that she is not worth anything or she is not lovable or you don’t love her any more. All that you are saying is ‘Right now I am not in a flow.’ You are saying something about you, not about her.\nAnd be true to yourself too. When you are not feeling in a flow, if you enforce the flow, it will be false, pseudo, and you will take revenge on her. You will be angry, because it is because of her that you are in this enforced role, as if she had been forcing it on you. And when you are not feeling to move with her, to go into love, to be together, don’t feel guilty either. One cannot be in that state of loving twenty-four hours a day. It is a rare moment – it comes once in a while – and it is valuable because it is rare. If it is just an ordinary thing, available on order, it will be of no value. It comes when it comes; you cannot order it. It is not in your control, so what can you do? When it comes, go together.\nAnd remember the second part of it: sometimes she may not feel flowing with you. Then be respectful to her feeling; don’t disturb her. Don’t force her to be with you or to be loving. Just out of your consideration she may go with you, but then it is false, and anything false never satisfies, never. Only truth gives contentment. So what is wrong in it? One day you feel flowing, flow; then for three days it disappears. Perfectly good – three days are not long. One can wait for the day that will be coming after three days.

<a href=part28>Next ></a></p><p><span id=bookmark26>‌</span>CHAPTER <span class=s3>27</span></p><p><br></p><p>28 July 1978 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium</p><p><br></p><p>Krishna is one of the incarnations of god. The Hindu concept of god
coming to earth is not like the Christian – not that god has only one
son, not that god only comes in one form, as Christ: god comes in many
forms, god comes in every age. God comes in every country, every time,
because god is not yet in a state of becoming careless towards man, and
will never be. God still hopes that man can be redeemed, that man is not
a hopeless case, so god comes again and again.</p><p><br></p><p>And whenever there is enlightenment, god takes possession of the
enlightened person, because the enlightened person is not a person at
all; he is just emptiness. And only in that emptiness can god take
possession. So whenever there is this emptiness, whenever the ego
disappears, god immediately appears. These are two aspects of the same
phenomenon: the ego disappearing and god appearing; the death of the ego
is the birth of god.</p><p><br></p><p>So in India we have many incarnations of god. Every enlightened
person is a god person. His own personality is gone. Now he is just a
hollow bamboo, and god can make a flute out of him and can sing his
song. And one of the best songs that he has sung is through Krishna...
one of the most beautiful, most enchanting.</p><p><br></p><p>The very word ‘krishna’ means enchanting, that which attracts,
magical, that which is like a magnet and by which people’s hearts are
suddenly moved.</p><p><br></p><p>And Krishna is also one of the most affirmative expressions of
god.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus is a little sad. And who knows? – Christians may be right; they
say he never laughed. At least in the way they have depicted him he
seems to be completely incapable of laughter. He may have laughed, but
the story that has come through the Christians is not of a laughing
Christ, and you</p><p>cannot think of him as dancing. Somehow they have made him fit with
the cross. He looks perfectly made for it; the sadness, the heaviness,
the seriousness, go perfectly well with the cross.</p><p><br></p><p>Krishna goes perfectly well with the flute, with flowers around his
neck, with beautiful clothes – the clothes of a dancer, with ornaments
on his body and with a throne, with all the grandeur, with a crown made
of peacock feathers... utterly beautiful, utterly affirmative.</p><p><br></p><p>The message is that religion should be a matter of dance, laughter,
love. It should not be serious. It should be light – it should not be
grave. It should be capable of loving this world and of affirming life,
not negating it.</p><p><br></p><p>[The new sannyasin says: I feel as if you know me<span class=s4></span>but it’s very strange.]</p><p><br></p><p>It is, but strange things are possible in life. Life is so full of
strange things – things which one cannot believe but which one has to
believe because they happen, things which are incredible. If somebody
else tells them to you, you will not believe them, but when they happen
to you, you have to believe. And that’s why life has value: it is a
constant surprise, you can never exhaust it, and each moment something
turns up which you had never expected, never dreamed about.</p><p><br></p><p>Life takes such sudden turns – unexpected, unpredictable. That’s the
beauty of it. That proves it is not mechanical. That proves it is
something more than a mechanical existence. It is not repetitive. And
strange things are the only proofs that god must be, because strange
things cannot be explained by reason, cannot be explained away by
reason. Reason simply stumbles over strange things and is at a loss.</p><p><br></p><p>In those moments when reason is at a loss something of the beyond
penetrates you. And the man is fortunate who comes across such moments
more often. And if you become available to such strange spaces, they
will come more often, they will happen more. In fact they have always
been happening but you were not aware. We only see that for which we are
on the alert. We go on missing much just because we are not looking for
it!</p><p><br></p><p>Scientists say we only see two percent of life; ninety-eight percent
is simply passed over. And in that ninety-eight-percent is all that is
beautiful, all that is beyond comprehension, all that is strange and
mysterious. What we see, the two percent, is nothing but utilitarian –
concerned with bread and butter... small things: the house, the family,
the relationship. Sooner or later one settles into a certain pattern and
then goes on revolving in the same pattern for the whole of life, and
dies.</p><p><br></p><p>Remain available to these strange things – invite them. And when they
happen, don’t be in a hurry to dissect them and don’t be in a hurry to
find some explanation for them. Wait! There are not explanations for
each and everything. And the things which have no explanations are the
real things. They are the doors – they take you into the unknown</p><p><br></p><p>And the things which have explanations are ordinary. Things that can
be reduced to knowledge are just mundane, and things which are elusive
and go on slipping out of your hands, are mercurial, like mercury, they
are the real things. Follow them – wherever they lead you go with them,
trust them, and you will never be a loser.</p><p>Prem means love, rajo means the secret – the secret of love, or love,
the secret. Love is the greatest secret there is, and if one can
discover it, one has discovered an inexhaustible treasure. It is
oceanic. One can go on and on. It begins but it never ends; it has a
beginning but no end.</p><p><br></p><p>On the path of love, many things happen of their own accord. It is
not the path of effort. The path of love is the path of surrender. You
don’t do much – rather, on the contrary, you simply allow yourself to be
available for things to happen. You are in a receptive passivity.</p><p><br></p><p>The path of effort is to be active, to be searching, to be seeking.
Some way or other ego is involved in it – it is an ego trip. On the path
of love one surrenders. One is not even to search or seek. One waits...
one is patient, and whenever the time is ripe, things start happening.
Love is trust that it is going to happen if one can wait enough.</p><p><br></p><p>On the path of love many things grow. Prayer grows... without any
effort. The lover comes to know about prayer not through any scripture,
not from the church. Those prayers that come from the scriptures and the
church are going to be pseudo, false, because they have not grown out of
your heart. They are plastic. You have purchased them in the market.
They are not real flowers. That is not the way of growing real flowers.
One has to become the soil. Roses come but one has to become the manure.
One has to die for those roses to come. On the path of love, prayer
grows. Suddenly one day you find that the rose is blooming, it has
bloomed, and you are full of the fragrance. And that fragrance is always
new. It is not the prayer that Jesus did or Krishna did. It will be your
prayer – it will come out of your being; it will have your colour, your
form, it will have your signature on it. It will be authentic.</p><p><br></p><p>On the path of love celebration grows of its own accord, and dancing
and singing, and life is no more a struggle but a let-go. And there are
things which happen only when you are in a let-go. All that is great
happens only when you are in a let-go. If you are in an effort to
conquer, you will conquer only small things.</p><p><br></p><p>Conquerors can become at the most Adolf Hitlers, Napoleons or
Alexanders. They never become Buddhas – they cannot. To become a Buddha
or to become a Christ, one has to be not in the mood of conquering at
all, but, on the contrary, to be conquered by god one has to be
feminine. That is the secret of love: to be feminine, to be passive, to
be open, vulnerable, ready to absorb, ready to be pregnant, just to be a
womb, and all that is needed comes. That’s what I call trust – that it
comes; whenever your real need is there, it comes. It never comes by
your search. It comes only when your real need is there. When you are
really thirsty, your thirst will be quenched.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what Jesus means when he says ‘Knock and the door shall be
opened unto you. Ask and it shall be given. Seek and ye shall find.’ But
by ‘seeking’ he does not mean an active search, because he says ‘The
kingdom of god is within you.’ How can you seek it actively? Where can
you go to search for it? There is nowhere to go. One has to relax into
oneself. The seeking has to be passive, the knocking has to be passive.
It has to be a kind of prayer in love.</p><p><br></p><p>[The new sannyasin asks how to accept that she is not close to
Osho<span class=s4></span>It takes so much effort.]</p><p><br></p><p>But you will be close! It takes a little time.…</p><p>Effort will not bring you close to me. Effort is the thing that is
keeping you distant. Drop the effort! Just be in a loving space, that’s
all; be in a prayerful space, that’s all... and you will come closer and
closer. It is not a question of your having to come closer. You are; it
is just that your effort is not allowing you to see that fact. You are
so concerned, so worried about being close that you can’t see the fact
that you are close. Your whole mine is focussed on how to be closer so
it can happen. You can go on searching for something which was just
around the corner.</p><p><br></p><p>Closeness is not a thing that can be achieved by effort. The distance
or closeness are not spatial, not in space; they are inner. One can be
close to me thousands of miles away physically, and one can be distant
just sitting in front of me. So it is not a question of space or time.
It is a question of seeing what is the case. From my side I am very
close to you. From your side you are still making efforts, and your
efforts are your undoing.</p><p><br></p><p>Drop the efforts and just enjoy being with me. Forget about
closeness, etcetera. Just enjoy. Be happy that you are with me, and
suddenly you will see that all the distance has disappeared.</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin says he has doubts about being a sannyasin because he
just wants to do a little meditation, be with his children – not
striving to make something special of his life.]</p><p><br></p><p>It is not special at all. Sannyas is exactly that: to live a very
ordinary life. These clothes and this mala are just to remind you so
that you don’t forget, that you have to live a very ordinary life. One
tends to forget. The ego comes in again and again and starts being
special. The ego is so clever that it can even try to be absolutely
ordinary so that one becomes extraordinary.</p><p><br></p><p>It can even hide behind the so-called ordinariness. It can say ‘Look!
I live a very ordinary life. Nobody lives such an ordinary life.
Everybody is after being somebody special. I am not!’ But it is finished
– the ego has come in!</p><p><br></p><p>These clothes, your love for me, your relationship to me, is just to
remind you how cunning the ego is. And they are a protection. You are
still in a space where the ego can destroy you; this is a protection.
And this idea comes to many people. They think ‘Now, meditation is going
well, things are feeling good, so what is the need of sannyas?’ They
don’t understand that the more things are going well, the more is the
need, because the more you become soft, vulnerable, open, the more
protection you will need.</p><p><br></p><p>Otherwise you can be easily destroyed by small things that are always
there like seeds in the mind. Once you forget about meditation, about
me, about sannyas, those small things Like seeds will sprout again and
become big trees. The seeds are not yet burned. It may be just that
those seeds are playing a trick upon you.</p><p><br></p><p>So be ordinary – there is no problem in it; that’s how one should be.
Live the ordinary life of eating, sleeping, taking care of your
children, loving. Don’t make anything special of yourself. But this is
precisely what sannyas is! Sannyas is not something special.</p><p><br></p><p>And doubts are expected. They will always be coming; until the mind
is dissolved totally doubts will go on coming. They will come less and
less but they will come. And then there are moods when you are flowing,
when you are happy; doubts are less. When you are not flowing and you
come into</p><p>a valley part, dark part, doubts are more. It is like in the day,
fear disappears, everything is clear. In the night, in the same room,
all is dark and the fear comes back. Doubts always come when you are
more unconscious, trust always when you are more conscious.</p><p><br></p><p>The totally conscious man is absolutely trustful. You can go on
deceiving him but he will not doubt you – he cannot; it is simply not
possible. He will not find anything that can bring the doubt back. You
can kill him but he will die in deep trust.</p><p><br></p><p>It happened... there is a very famous Tibetan story: A young man came
and surrendered to a master, but the master was a bogus one, just a
pretender. But the disciple’s surrender was so tremendously total that
he achieved. The master was bogus, the master knew nothing, but the
disciple’s surrender was total, his trust was total, and miracles
started happening in the disciple’s life. Even the master was surprised
because he could not believe it – he himself could not do such things!
The disciple was doing things: he was walking on water! The master
himself tried, thinking ‘If my disciple can walk on water, then why not
I ? Maybe I have not tried it yet.’ He asked the disciple ‘What do you
do?’</p><p><br></p><p>The disciple said ‘But what is there to do? I just simply remember
you! I remember your name and everything is possible. I have passed
through fire and I was not burned; I have walked on water; I have jumped
from the mountain cliff and I was not hurt. Just your name! And you know
it – why are you asking me?’</p><p><br></p><p>The master tried but he nearly drowned. He tried saying his own name,
he tried to remember himself, but he was afraid; doubt was there. He
could not believe that this was possible – just repeating his name?</p><p><br></p><p>So it is not a question of whom you are with. The greater question
is: how much trust? But one cannot force trust. If you force, those
doubts remain repressed and they will come back; so rather than forcing
trust, watch those doubts, become aware. Observe them, take note that
they are there, but don’t be trapped by them, don’t be overpowered by
them.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddhists have a technique for it. They say: when doubt comes, repeat
inside ‘Doubt, doubt’... and watch. Whenever doubt comes repeat twice
‘Doubt, doubt’ and watch. You are the witness and the doubt is there –
and you have named it doubt; just watch. You have labelled it. And
slowly slowly you will see that if you are not identified with the
doubts, they come less and less and one day they disappear. That day is
a day of great liberation when all doubts disappear and only trust is
left. That trust will give you all that your life contains in itself. It
will give you the whole world.</p><p><br></p><p>So the idea is good – remain ordinary, but don’t make much fuss about
it, mm? Enjoy it and continue to meditate.</p><p><br></p><p>[The sannyasin then says he doesn’t feel like doing groups.] That s
the doubt.</p><p>I am not saying to you to go into fire and I am not saying to walk on
water and I am not saying ‘Jump from the cliff, off the mountain.’ Just
think if I say ‘Jump from the cliff, off the mountain!’ I am just saying
do a few groups, and the ‘no’ comes.</p><p>The I is too strong – ‘I don’t feel like it.’ If you have not done
any groups what right have you to...?</p><p><br></p><p>You have never done them, so how can you have some idea of whether to
do them or not, or whether they will be helpful or not?... Then why do
you decide so absolutely and so easily ? Why do you allow the no to
come? You could have said to me ‘If they are helpful, I will do them.’
But you cannot even ask that.</p><p><br></p><p>And you think you will be able to live an ordinary; life! You say
that these doubts are there and you ask how to drop them... but you have
been nourishing them.<span class=s4></span>Nourishing them, nurturing
them,</p><p>feeding them.</p><p><br></p><p>It is up to you. Just be here.</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin says that deep inside he always feels sad. Osho checks
his energy.]</p><p><br></p><p>Nothing to be worried about. It is not really sadness – you are just
becoming less excited, and that’s good. It can appear to be like
sadness. Many things are so similar that one can get confused.</p><p><br></p><p>If a man has always lived with excitement and then it leaves, he
feels like falling into sadness. But it is perfectly good. Your fever is
disappearing; you are becoming more still, more calm. Don’t call it
sadness. It is just the silence that comes after the storm.<span class=s4></span>and more silence will be coming.</p><p><br></p><p>If you call it sadness you have already taken an anti attitude
towards it. In calling it sadness you have already condemned it, and you
will hold yourself back. You will try to do something so that you are
not sad. But it is not sadness at all – it is just a meditative
stillness, something immensely valuable. Only later on will you be able
to see the point of it.<span class=s4></span>when it has come to its
full flowering.</p><p><br></p><p>It is just as if a man has always lived with fever and then he
becomes healthy, the fever disappears. He will think ‘What is happening?
I am losing my energy, my heat, my life. I am becoming cold. Am I dying
or something?’ All that is happening is that the fever is leaving him –
he is becoming healthier. It’s perfectly good.</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin couple have just arrived from the West. Osho had told
them to live separately. Osho checks their energy, and says there is no
need for them to separate. But give each other as much space as
possible, for they love each other deeply and a love of that intensity
needs a break. Mini- divorces every day mean there need never be a real
divorce. Love is like food, says Osho, and if you go on stuffing
yourself with chocolates and with goodies all day long, you’ll never
experience real hunger. Love is a food.<span class=s4></span>a goodie,
beware of it – don’t go on stuffing.]</p><p><br></p><p>[Another couple are in conflict. The man says when he is with his
partner he feels surrendered to her and its tremendous, but often he
needs a few days away from her, and she does not like this.]</p><p><br></p><p>(To the man) Simply listen to your feelings. When you feel flowing,
flow; when you don’t feel flowing there is no need to force it. Don’t
create unnecessary problems for yourself. And she is perfectly ready to
allow you that much space; there is no problem from her side. But be
true: whenever you are feeling flowing, flow. Don’t play a politician.
In times when you want to be with her – as she is saying – you say no,
but she feels that you want to say yes. Don’t play the politician. If
you want to</p><p>say yes, say yes; if you want to say no, say no. Because women are
very perceptive. If deep down you want to say yes and on the surface you
are saying no, she will be able to feel it. They have a deeper
sensitivity to feel, they are intuitive. It is very difficult to deceive
a woman, and she is almost always right.</p><p><br></p><p>So there is no need... when you love a woman, simply be true. Don’t
play this male chauvinistic game. The male mind is such that even when
it wants the woman to be close, it says no, because it wants to pretend
‘I don’t need anybody. I am enough unto myself. If you want me, you can
come, but I don’t need you.’ That is foolish – you cannot deceive a
woman – and that unnecessarily creates complexity. Life as it is is
complicated enough; don’t make it more complicated. Make it as simple as
possible. If there is yes, then yes; if there is no, there is no. Don’t
create confusion. And she will be able – she loves you – she will be
able to understand it when you want to say no; she will not feel
offended.</p><p><br></p><p>Truth never really offends. To be true to a person is really being
respectful to the person. If you are not respectful then you have to be
diplomatic. Then you have to play; you have to use games and strategies.
But when you love a person simply say<span class=s4></span>And it is
not in any way condemning her; when</p><p>you want to be alone it says nothing about her. It doesn’t say that
she is not worth anything or she is not lovable or you don’t love her
any more. All that you are saying is ‘Right now I am not in a flow.’ You
are saying something about you, not about her.</p><p><br></p><p>And be true to yourself too. When you are not feeling in a flow, if
you enforce the flow, it will be false, pseudo, and you will take
revenge on her. You will be angry, because it is because of her that you
are in this enforced role, as if she had been forcing it on you. And
when you are not feeling to move with her, to go into love, to be
together, don’t feel guilty either. One cannot be in that state of
loving twenty-four hours a day. It is a rare moment – it comes once in a
while – and it is valuable because it is rare. If it is just an ordinary
thing, available on order, it will be of no value. It comes when it
comes; you cannot order it. It is not in your control, so what can you
do? When it comes, go together.</p><p><br></p><p>And remember the second part of it: sometimes she may not feel
flowing with you. Then be respectful to her feeling; don’t disturb her.
Don’t force her to be with you or to be loving. Just out of your
consideration she may go with you, but then it is false, and anything
false never satisfies, never. Only truth gives contentment. So what is
wrong in it? One day you feel flowing, flow; then for three days it
disappears. Perfectly good – three days are not long. One can wait for
the day that will be coming after three days. And don’t feel that you
are in a miserable state because only once in three days do you feel
flowing. You should be happy! There are people who don’t feel flowing
and months pass, years pass, and there are people who have never felt
flowing in their whole lives.</p><p><br></p><p>But just be true, and don’t be diplomatic.<span class=s4></span>and
report to me after six weeks how you are flowing. But</p><p>things are perfectly good.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part26>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

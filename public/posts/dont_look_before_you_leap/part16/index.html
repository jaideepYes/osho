One who has divine discontent is the most fortunate, because only those who are afire with a desire to know god will be able to know him. And the fire has to be a total fire; one has to burn at the optimum. Just a little holding back and one misses. The ego has to be completely dissolved into the desire for god. One has to die, and that’s the only way to life abundant.\nPeople are in discontent, but their discontent is about things – prestige, power, money, et cetera. The same discontent has to be turned and focussed on god. Once all the discontent of life is focussed on god, it creates tremendous energy... energy that can transform you just by its sheer presence. You can ride on the wave of it.\nPeople are discontented about the wrong things and contented with the wrong things too. People are topsy-turvy, upside-down. Discontent ordinarily is extrovert, but people are very contented with their own beings as they are – no desire, no urge to be transformed, not even a small flicker to be something else, to reach to the peaks of being, to have new plenitudes of consciousness.\nPeople go on exploring the mountains, the Himalayas and the moon, but they never turn in. There they think all is as it should be, or they have not even meditated upon it at all – that man as he exists is only a potential, just a seed of great possibilities, that man as he is, is not yet actual, not yet real.\nThe realisation has to happen. And only those who become actual, real, live life in its totality and become aware of the mysteries of existence. Their joy is infinite and their ecstasy unending.\nThis is the meaning of your name. Let your sannyas become a great divine discontent. God has to be found, and all has to be staked in the risk. My sannyasin has to be a gambler.\nAnd the meaning of satyarthi is of immense significance – it means a seeker of truth. There are very few people in the world who are really in search of truth. Even those who say they are in search of truth are not in search of truth. They are in search of consolation, they are in search of a beautiful lie, they are in search of a fiction, an illusion. They have already decided what truth is and then they start searching! That is taking the very first step in a wrong direction.\nThe real seeker of truth moves without any conclusion. He knows not, he starts from absolute ignorance. He has no idea of what truth is. He can’t have any idea, because he knows not ! His whole search consists in being open to it, whatsoever it is. He is not in search of a particular truth that the tradition has given to him. He is not in search of a certain idea of truth. He is simply in search of what this existence is, what this now is, what this here is, with no idea, with no prejudice, with no concept, with no a priori conclusion. He opens himself to reality – naked, utterly naked, indefensible, vulnerable.\nThe man who has already decided will find whatsoever he has decided, because he will project it, he will invent it, he will create it around himself. But that will be just a mind creation, it will be a dream dreamed so deeply that it looks as if it is real. And the more this so-called truth becomes real, the more he will become real; the more the dream becomes real, the more the dreamer becomes unreal. Both can’t be real together; this is something to be understood. Either the dreamer is real, then the dream disappears; or the dream is real, then the dreamer becomes completely unconscious.\nSo those who have decided according to the Gita, according to the Koran, according to the Dhammapada – those who have already decided according to some book or some teaching or some tradition, will create it, they will find it. But it will not be truth – it will be their truth but not the truth, and the truth is nobody’s. To know it one has to drop all accumulated mind.\nThis is the greatest adventure in life; no other adventure can be compared to this. Its ecstasy is great, but courage is needed to be utterly naked with reality, with no mind, to be with reality without the barrier of the mind. That is the meaning of satyarthi: existentially one has to enquire into the reality that is, that which is, that surrounds us, within and without.\nThere is no need to go to second-hand sources. Truth is available first-hand. Truth is constantly available, immediately available; there is no need to bring in Buddha or Mahavir or Krishna. And the beauty is: when you know it without bringing anybody in, they are fulfilled in you. And if you bring them in, you will be simply creating it; it will be your own script. And existence is so cooperative that if you want to create a dream it cooperates; it is so generous, its generosity is infinite. So even if you are dreaming it helps you to dream.\nSo there are millions of people who think they are searching for truth. They are not searching for truth; they are searching for their idea of truth. And how can truth be your idea or my idea or anybody else’s idea? Truth is simply truth. In fact it cannot be an idea at all, it is an experience.\nLet this sannyas become a great enquiry into truth. And the deeper you go into it, the more aware you become of all the blessings that are constantly being showered on you. The more you go into it, the more sensitive you become – to colour, to taste, to sound, to beauty. Life starts becoming richer and richer and richer. The really religious person is the richest, because his perception is infinite, his clarity is infinite, his depth is infinite, his love is infinite and his sense of mystery is infinite. And these are all the aspects of truth.\nGood! Start meditating. Have you tried the meditation here? Choose one, any one.\n[A sannyasin, who is a film star, says: I’ve been talking too much. And I find it very difficult to relate. I talk to the extent of attacking somebody, you know, making him listen... And I just feel that I should keep shut, but I keep wanting to talk.\nOsho checks his energy.]\nMy feeling is totally different. You should continue to talk. There is no need to stop it. It is part of growth. It has two purposes to fulfill. One: it is a kind of catharsis. The silence will come on its own; you should not try to keep yourself shut. If you try to keep yourself shut, it will not be silence; it will be a forced stillness and it will not make you natural, spontaneous. You will start boiling within. That is far more dangerous. It is better to let the steam go out. So one thing: it is going to help a certain catharsis.\nIt is not accidental. Before one can fall into a deep silence, it always happens: one starts talking too much. The mind starts unwinding itself, that’s all. The mind is a mechanism; it has to unwind. It is a tape; it has to be erased, and the only way is to express. Once you have expressed a thing really and totally, it is erased, you are finished with it. That happens to all kinds of creative people. A painter starts feeling such an obsession to paint that he cannot help it. He has to paint. Once he has painted it, he is relieved; a great burden has disappeared.\nA poet wants to write, a singer wants to sing. And these are beyond them – it is not that they are doing something. Something bigger than you, greater than you, takes possession of you. One is possessed.\nThat’s why you are feeling so worried, mm? because you may become very very aggressive while you talk. The other may want to listen or not, but – you will force the other to listen. Naturally, you start feeling ‘This is not good. Why should I do it?’ But you cannot help it either. So rather than crying to control it, allow it – one thing. It will be a good catharsis before a silence descends on you.\nAnd the second thing: what is happening to you has to be told too. And it has to be told from the housetops! You have to become my messenger too. And it has always been so: who wants to listen to truth? People like gossips, not gospels. People are afraid of anything that is true. They are afraid they may get into it and there may be no way of going back. They have always been afraid. So don’t be worried about it – the silence will come on its own Meanwhile two things have to be fulfilled one is your catharsis; another is, I will use that catharsis. If you allow me I can speak through you; then you need not worry. You just leave it to me – just be the vehicle, the instrument, and then you will not feel any problems.\nThis is happening to many people – it is happening to all of my therapists here: slowly slowly they come to understand that they have to allow me then the work takes a new plunge. Then they are not tired, they are not worried. There is no question of them being a success or a failure. They are not concerned about whether the other is helped or not. They are just in my hands, so whatsoever I want they simply do it... and great things start happening. Forget that you are doing it; remember that I am doing it through you, and then the burden will disappear. You will not feel so worried about it, there is no question of being worried.\nAnd on its own, as it has come, it will disappear one day. Then even if you want to say something, you will find yourself dumb. That moment will also come – wait! – when it becomes impossible to say a thing; even small things which are absolutely necessary, one simply does not feel like saying. When silence grips, that also comes like a possession. And one has just to be a witness to all these phenomena.\nYou enjoy it – while it lasts, enjoy it – and when silence comes, enjoy that too. And drop the idea that you have to do something – to control or to shut yourself. No need to control. Find more and more expression, more ways to express yourself. And don’t create a contradiction in your energy. If it wants to say something to somebody – allow it, totally go with it. Be in it and don’t withhold yourself. Once a person is not withholding himself and goes totally into his words, those words become fire, those words create conviction, conversion. And it is not a question of arguing; it is only the question of passionate involvement, commitment. You can always see the difference.\nWhen a person of commitment, involvement, speaks, his words simply go like spears into your heart, because they are not only words – he is not just talking for talking’s sake; it is his life and his death. And you being an actor, your art has to be that of extroversion. The whole art of acting is an extrovert art – of talking, of relating, of acting, of performing. Allow all these things.\nAnd don’t be worried about what others say. Never be worried what others say. They have always been saying things. Who cares? You do your thing, you say your thing and don’t care about it. First people laugh, ignore, argue; slowly slowly they start worshipping! One just has to go on persisting.\nAnd something beautiful is growing. Your energy is going so well, and I am so happy with the energy that unless I see some problem in the energy, I am not going to say to you to change anything. Just continue as things are going, but go with more relaxation.\nGurdjieff used to say to his disciples ‘Don’t consider others.’ That looks very hard, because we have been taught always to consider others, but Gurdjieff is right: if you consider others you will never grow into truth. Then you will always be polite, a hypocrite, just trying to be good to this and good to that, just trying to be good to everybody. That’s what a polished person does, but a polished person remains just a polished person; inside nothing ever happens.\nI am very interested in you, and something great is growing. If you can persevere, if you can wait, one day you will be surprised by the explosion. And these are good signs.\nJust go and talk and say whatsoever you feel like. I have said so many things to you, that if you just help people to understand them – whether they understand them or not is not the point – in trying to make them understand, you will understand! And the best way to learn a thing is to teach it.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2285","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/dont_look_before_you_leap/part16/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/dont_look_before_you_leap/>Don\'t Look Before You Leap</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">16</h1><div class=post-meta>11 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2285 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Dont_Look_Before_You_Leap/part16.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part15>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

true. They are afraid they may get into it and there may be no way of
going back. They have always been afraid. So don’t be worried about it –
the silence will come on its own Meanwhile two things have to be
fulfilled one is your catharsis; another is, I will use that catharsis.
If you allow me I can speak through you; then you need not worry. You
just leave it to me – just be the vehicle, the instrument, and then you
will not feel any problems.</p><p><br></p><p>This is happening to many people – it is happening to all of my
therapists here: slowly slowly they come to understand that they have to
allow me then the work takes a new plunge. Then they are not tired, they
are not worried. There is no question of them being a success or a
failure. They are not concerned about whether the other is helped or
not. They are just in my hands, so whatsoever I want they simply do
it... and great things start happening. Forget that you are doing it;
remember that I am doing it through you, and then the burden will
disappear. You will not feel so worried about it, there is no question
of being worried.</p><p>And on its own, as it has come, it will disappear one day. Then even
if you want to say something, you will find yourself dumb. That moment
will also come – wait! – when it becomes impossible to say a thing; even
small things which are absolutely necessary, one simply does not feel
like saying. When silence grips, that also comes like a possession. And
one has just to be a witness to all these phenomena.</p><p><br></p><p>You enjoy it – while it lasts, enjoy it – and when silence comes,
enjoy that too. And drop the idea that you have to do something – to
control or to shut yourself. No need to control. Find more and more
expression, more ways to express yourself. And don’t create a
contradiction in your energy. If it wants to say something to somebody –
allow it, totally go with it. Be in it and don’t withhold yourself. Once
a person is not withholding himself and goes totally into his words,
those words become fire, those words create conviction, conversion. And
it is not a question of arguing; it is only the question of passionate
involvement, commitment. You can always see the difference.</p><p><br></p><p>When a person of commitment, involvement, speaks, his words simply go
like spears into your heart, because they are not only words – he is not
just talking for talking’s sake; it is his life and his death. And you
being an actor, your art has to be that of extroversion. The whole art
of acting is an extrovert art – of talking, of relating, of acting, of
performing. Allow all these things.</p><p><br></p><p>And don’t be worried about what others say. Never be worried what
others say. They have always been saying things. Who cares? You do your
thing, you say your thing and don’t care about it. First people laugh,
ignore, argue; slowly slowly they start worshipping! One just has to go
on persisting.</p><p><br></p><p>And something beautiful is growing. Your energy is going so well, and
I am so happy with the energy that unless I see some problem in the
energy, I am not going to say to you to change anything. Just continue
as things are going, but go with more relaxation.</p><p><br></p><p>Gurdjieff used to say to his disciples ‘Don’t consider others.’ That
looks very hard, because we have been taught always to consider others,
but Gurdjieff is right: if you consider others you will never grow into
truth. Then you will always be polite, a hypocrite, just trying to be
good to this and good to that, just trying to be good to everybody.
That’s what a polished person does, but a polished person remains just a
polished person; inside nothing ever happens.</p><p><br></p><p>I am very interested in you, and something great is growing. If you
can persevere, if you can wait, one day you will be surprised by the
explosion. And these are good signs.</p><p><br></p><p>Just go and talk and say whatsoever you feel like. I have said so
many things to you, that if you just help people to understand them –
whether they understand them or not is not the point – in trying to make
them understand, you will understand! And the best way to learn a thing
is to teach it.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part15>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

‌CHAPTER 1
The Search for the Bull and Discovering the Footprints
1 March 1976 am in Buddha Hall
1. THE SEARCH FOR THE BULL
IN THE PASTURE OF THIS WORLD,
I ENDLESSLY PUSH ASIDE THE TALL GRASSES IN SEARCH OF THE BULL. FOLLOWING UNNAMED RIVERS,
LOST UPON THE INTERPENETRATING PATHS OF DISTANT MOUNTAINS,
MY STRENGTH FAILING AND MY VITALITY EXHAUSTED, I CANNOT FIND THE BULL.</description>

‌CHAPTER 2
Dropping the Why
2 March 1976 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
BELOVED OSHO, I DON’T KNOW WHY I AM HERE.
Nobody knows – and there is no way to know it, and there is no need to know it. This constant questioning – why am I here? why am I doing this? – this constant hankering for the why, is a disease of the mind.</description>

‌CHAPTER 3
Perceiving the Bull
4 March 1976 am in Buddha Hall
3. PERCEIVING THE BULL
I HEAR THE SONG OF THE NIGHTINGALE.
THE SUN IS WARM, THE WIND IS MILD, WILLOWS ARE GREEN ALONG THE SHORE. HERE NO BULL CAN HIDE!
WHAT ARTIST CAN DRAW THAT MASSIVE HEAD, THOSE MAJESTIC HORNS? COMMENT:
WHEN ONE HEARS THE VOICE, ONE CAN SENSE ITS SOURCE. AS SOON AS THE SIX SENSES MERGE, THE GATE IS ENTERED.</description>

‌CHAPTER 4
Happiness Knows No Tomorrow
5 March 1976 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
YOU SAY THAT MIND’S SUBSTANCE IS MEMORY AND INFORMATION. DOES READING THEREFORE INFLATE AND INVIGORATE THE MIND?
It depends. It depends on you. You can use reading as a food for the ego. It is very subtle. You can become knowledgeable; then it is dangerous and harmful.</description>

‌CHAPTER 5
Taming the Bull
6 March 1976 am in Buddha Hall
5. TAMING THE BULL
THE WHIP AND ROPE ARE NECESSARY,
ELSE HE MIGHT STRAY OFF DOWN SOME DUSTY ROAD. BEING WELL TRAINED, HE BECOMES NATURALLY GENTLE. THEN, UNFETTERED, HE OBEYS HIS MASTER.
COMMENT:
WHEN ONE THOUGHT ARISES, ANOTHER THOUGHT FOLLOWS. WHEN THE FIRST THOUGHT SPRINGS FROM ENLIGHTENMENT, ALL SUBSEQUENT THOUGHTS ARE TRUE.</description>

‌CHAPTER 6
Come In!
7 March 1976 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
FOR SOME YEARS I HAVE BEEN KEEPING A JOURNAL TO RECORD MY IDEAS, THOUGHTS, FEELINGS, SPACES. LATELY, THOUGH, I OPEN THE BOOK AND JUST STARE AT THE BLANK PAGE OR DRAW LITTLE PICTURES. MUCH SEEMS TO BE HAPPENING YET NOTHING SEEMS TO BE HAPPENING. THE WORDS JUST DON’T SEEM TO COME THE WAY THEY USED TO.</description>

‌CHAPTER 7
The Bull Transcended
8 March 1976 am in Buddha Hall
7. THE BULL TRANSCENDED ASTRIDE THE BULL, I REACH HOME.
I AM SERENE. THE BULL TOO CAN REST.
THE DAWN HAS COME. IN BLISSFUL REPOSE,
WITHIN MY THATCHED DWELLING I HAVE ABANDONED THE WHIP AND ROPE COMMENT:
ALL IS ONE LAW, NOT TWO. WE ONLY MAKE THE BULL A TEMPORARY SUBJECT. IT IS AS THE RELATION OF RABBIT AND TRAP, OF FISH AND NET.</description>

‌CHAPTER 8
Life is the Goal
9 March 1976 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
IT SEEMS AS IF EVERYTHING I PERCEIVE IN OR OUT OF MEDITATION IS MY OWN CREATION OR PROJECTION. I CAN’T DISTINGUISH BETWEEN WHAT I SEE, FEEL OR AM CREATING.
OSHO, WHAT IS?
There is no need to distinguish between thoughts, dreams and reality. If you try, you will feel more confused.</description>

‌CHAPTER 9
Reaching the Source
10 March 1976 am in Buddha Hall
9. REACHING THE SOURCE
TOO MANY STEPS HAVE BEEN TAKEN RETURNING TO THE ROOT AND THE SOURCE. BETTER TO HAVE BEEN BLIND AND DEAF FROM THE BEGINNING!
DWELLING IN ONE’S TRUE ABODE, UNCONCERNED WITH THAT WITHOUT – THE RIVER FLOWS TRANQUILLY ON AND THE FLOWERS ARE RED.
COMMENT:
FROM THE BEGINNING, TRUTH IS CLEAR. POISED IN SILENCE, I OBSERVE THE FORMS OF INTEGRATION AND DISINTEGRATION.</description>

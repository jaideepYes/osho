I FIND IT EXPRESSES ITSELF THROUGH ARROGANCE, AND THE SAFETY OF ONLY WANTING TO STAY ON THE SIDE OF THE GIVER. I FEEL LIKE A ROCKET WHICH IS ALL PREPARED TO BE LAUNCHED: ALL THE SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN CLEARED BUT ONE LOCK IS STILL ON – THE LOCK OF PROTECTION.\nOSHO, WOULD YOU SHOW ME THE KEY TO UNLOCK PROTECTION – OR IS THERE NO LOCK?\nDavid, man is born with death in his heart. As he grows, death also grows. Life and death are almost like two wings. The day life has reached to its peak, death also reaches its peak; hence the unknown fear, and the desire to be protected.\nBut there is only one way to unlock – only one key. This desire to be protected can disappear only when you understand that the life that you have known is not the eternal life. The dewdrop has to die; there is no way of protecting it.\nBut in the death of the dewdrop is a new beginning. It is not an end; it is the beginning of the very ocean. The dewdrop becomes the ocean. Then all fears – of insecurity, of death, of disease, of old age – they all disappear together.\nBut man goes on doing just the opposite. Seeing that there is a desire to be protected, he tries to find all kinds of protection – in money, in power, in respectability. But the longing is simply the same: somehow I should be so powerful and so secure that the fear of the unknown, of death, can be forgotten.\nBut there is no way to forget it. You can get busy with thousands of things, but it is always there like an undercurrent – because it is a natural phenomenon. Death is not something that is going to come from outside.\nI have always loved an old parable: A king was very much afraid of death. He had conquered many lands, he was a great warrior, he was adequately safe, secure – there was no need to be afraid. But the problem is: death does not come from outside – it grows within you. You bring it with your birth.\nBut nobody told him this; on the contrary, his advisers told him, “You should make a palace in which there should be no windows, no doors – just one door, and on that door there should be seven-fold security. One guard – but who can trust? – then another guard to guard the first guard, and so on. Seven lines of guards... you will be absolutely protected.”\nHe made the palace. The idea looked logical; but all that is logical is not realistic – logic is not equivalent to life. The palace was made. The king was very happy, the guarding system was so secure. There was only one door; no enemy could enter from anywhere.\nOne of his friends, another king, heard about the palace and came to see it. He was immensely impressed. It was a piece of art inside, was made all of marble, and everything for the king’s pleasure was there: beautiful fountains, waterfalls – but everything was inside the palace. The friend said, “I would like a palace just like this in my own kingdom. It feels so secure.”\nAs he was leaving, the host king came out, and the friend thanked him again. As he was getting into his golden chariot he said, “I am immensely grateful, because you have made something which is really secure. Just help me with your architects and the stonecutters; I want to make exactly the same palace in my kingdom.”\nJust then a beggar sitting in the street started laughing. Both the kings felt embarrassed, and the host asked the beggar, “Why are you laughing?”\nHe said, “Once I used to be a king myself, but just to find security I became a beggar. Since I have become a beggar, nobody is interested in killing me. I sleep in the street without any fear. I have one suggestion to make to you – and I am older than both of you, and my kingdom was far bigger than your kingdoms.\n“My suggestion is that there is a flaw in your palace. I have been sitting here and watching – but nobody has bothered about the flaw.”\nThe king said, “What flaw?”\nThe beggar said, “There is one door. The best security will be for you to get in and let your stonecutters close the door. Instead of a door there should be a beautiful marble wall. Then nobody can enter there.\n“Even these seven lines of guards can conspire – it is not inconceivable – to acquire the whole kingdom. You are in the hands of these seven men. If they join together, they can kill you and divide your whole kingdom. And it is such a simple thing it that is bound to come into their minds. You think you are secure – you are more insecure than ever; you are just in the hands of seven people.”\nThe king said, “Your idea is right – but what is the point of living if there is no door to come out?”\nAnd the beggar laughed again. He said, “You need not come out. Death can enter without a door – because in fact it does not enter from the outside; it is sitting within you, just like a seed.”\nYou may not be very conscious, David, nobody is very conscious – that you are dying every day, inch by inch. And one day the process is complete. Death is not an incident, but a process: it has the same length as your life. If you are going to live seventy or eighty years, your death also has eighty years to live with you.\nThis life – what we understand as life – is in the hands of death, and there is no way of protection. But I know a golden key, which is to find in yourself a deeper layer of life, deeper than this life and deeper than this death. That deepest layer is eternal. There is no need to protect it; it is protected by the whole of existence itself. There is a lock, and that is your mind, which prevents your going in. And there is a key: I call it meditation.\nBefore meditation, the mind disappears. Not that the lock is opened... but the lock simply disappears, and you enter into your kingdom of eternity. And only then does one feel secure.\nEven if death comes, and it is bound to come, you will be watching it: you will not be dying. Your body will be dying, your mind will be dying, but before death you have already abandoned them. You have gone deeper than both the superficial layers.\nExcept through meditation, nobody has come to know about eternity, about immortality, about the timelessness of our being. Therefore to me religion simply means meditation. Anything else is superfluous, nonessential.\nThis is the miracle of meditation: that it does not divide people. There is no Christian meditation, there is no Hindu meditation, there is no Mohammedan meditation, and there is no Jewish meditation.\nMeditation is a science.\nAll that is nonessential in religions divides people; and the non-essential becomes so big, so heavy, that the small key of meditation is lost or forgotten.\nPeople feel offended with me, annoyed with me, irritated, because I want them not to be Hindus, not to be Christians, not to be Jainas – but only to be meditators... because meditation is the only essential religion that can join you to your real self.\nThe word “religion” has to be understood. It means “bringing together.” You have gone far away from yourself. To bring you back together with your reality is the only religion there is.\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nEVERY DAY I COME OUT OF YOUR DISCOURSE, HAVING BEEN SITTING WITH YOU, LISTENING TO YOUR VOICE AND DANCING TO YOUR MUSIC. COMING OUT OF THE GATE THE WORLD LOOKS SO FRESH, THE GREEN SO DEEP AND SHINY, THE PLAY OF THE SUN WITH THE SHADOW SO RICH, AND THE PEOPLE SOFT AND OPEN. BELOVED MASTER, WHAT’S THE MAGIC YOU USE IN CLEANING MY EYES? IS IT THIS OR IS NATURE REJOICING TOO IN THE PRESENCE OF SUCH A BEAUTIFUL MASTER AND SHOWING ITS MOST CELEBRATIVE AND BEAUTIFUL SIDE TO US? IS THIS YOUR BUDDHAFIELD FLOWING THROUGH EVERYBODY AND EVERYTHING PRESENT HERE?\nAnand Premartha, it is both. Sitting here in silence, being showered by my silence, my serenity, everything in you becomes fresh, young. Silence is such a shower of the soul.\nListening to the music – not only listening, but participating, almost dancing with joy – you forget your ordinary worries and the world, the tensions and anxieties; those are the layers of dust on your eyes.\nAnd just being with me here, something that is not visible to the eyes transpires between me and you. Some energy, which can only be called divine, passes from heart to heart. I can see that there are moments when you all disappear, and only one consciousness remains. You forget your individuality, your separateness. And this is such a rejuvenation, such a refreshment, such a rebirth, that when you go out – things are the same – but the green looks greener; the people look softer and more loving. The song of the birds, although meaningless, starts having a significance of its own. All your senses are at their maximum sensitivity. The light passing through the trees fills you with wonder. The wind passing through the trees whispers unknown secrets to you.\nSo on the one hand you are ready, available, fresh, rested, relaxed, and silent; and on the other hand you are part of existence. Existence rejoices with you. It is not only that your eyes are fresh and your mind is silent, that the trees are greener – that is only one part of the story.\nThe other part is that because of your silence, because of your dance, because of your music, they really are greener – just for you, a special gift.\nIt is said that whenever Gautam Buddha passed by any path, even if it was not the time for the trees to blossom, they blossomed. Buddhists have not been able to explain it; no scientific explanation is possible. Only a mystic can understand it; only a meditator can understand what it means – that trees which were without leaves immediately started growing leaves and foliage, preparing a little shadow for the tired Buddha to rest under.\nThat is what you are experiencing: existence certainly rejoices when you are blissful. Existence is almost an echo of your being. If you are in anxiety, everything around you becomes tense; and if you are silent, everything around you becomes a silent music, a silent dance.\nRemember that you are not separate from existence; so when you are happy, all these trees are also happy. Happiness is contagious. When you are dancing, these trees are also moving in rhythm with you.\nWhen you are full of love whoever meets you – he may be a very primitive, crude man, but your love is more powerful than any crudeness, any primitiveness... with you, suddenly he feels he is becoming soft.\nYou have known this experience in many other ways. There are people with whom you become sad. They have not done anything to you and they have not said anything to you, but their sadness is so heavy and so powerful. We are continuously broadcasting our hearts all around us.\nIf a sad man passes by, his sadness is going to touch your heart too, unless your joyfulness is bigger than his sadness; then he will be touched. And you know about people with whom you suddenly become joyous for no reason at all, just being with them it feels as if a certain joy, a certain happiness has entered into you.\nBut listening to me is nothing but a meditation. This is my simplest device, in which you have not to do anything at all. I tell you to meditate, but I cannot leave it to you. You may think, “Yes, I will meditate,” and you go on postponing. That is why every morning and evening I speak to you. It does not matter what I say. I am not an orator, neither am I a preacher, nor am I giving you a doctrine or a philosophy. This is a device: because you want to listen to me, you are bound to be silent. Without your knowing, you are falling deeper and deeper into your being.\nSo when you go out, you have not gone out of a lecture hall. This Chuang Tzu hall is not a lecture hall, it is a place – a temple – of meditation. That’s why I always go on leaving gaps for you: in those gaps there is every possibility you may touch your innermost core.\nSo don’t say after “listening” to me, say after “meditating” with me, when you go out all your senses are more sensitive. And the whole of existence rejoices because you have a totally different fragrance, a different presence. You carry something of me with you every day.\nSlowly, slowly you will be able to sit by yourself alone, doing nothing, sitting silently. And in that silence, you will know all the mysteries of existence.\nThis is one of the mysteries: that everything is interconnected. Your joy is felt by the trees – your sadness too. Your silence is experienced by the birds – your dance, your music too.\nQuestion 3 BELOVED OSHO,\nMANY TIMES IN MY MEDITATION I ASKED YOU NOT TO SHOW ME DIRECTLY THE TREMENDOUS TRAGEDY THAT IS HAPPENING ON EARTH TODAY, AS I KNOW I COULD NEVER TOLERATE SUCH SUFFERING. YET I’M SENSING THIS ALL THE TIME, EVEN WITH MY BUFFERS. I KNOW YOU ARE THE LIGHT FOR THIS WHOLE PLANET, AND KNOWING THIS CARRIES SUCH A RESPONSIBILITY. I WOULD BE SO GRATEFUL TO HEAR YOU SPEAK TO ME ON HELPING, KNOWING I CAN’T HELP, AND THE ANGST OF FEELING HELPLESS – AND ALSO OF RELAXING WHEN FEELING SUCH A STATE OF URGENCY.\nPrem Kaveesha, I can understand your anguish about the whole of humanity, about this planet earth; because every day we are coming closer and closer to a disaster.\nIt is because the disaster is coming very close; even with your buffers you cannot forget it – and it hurts. And it hurts more because you feel you cannot help; you cannot do anything. It is simply beyond the capacity of any individual to prevent this calamity, this disaster, this global suicide that seems to be almost certain. But I have a way of my own.\nYou feel helpless because you think in terms of helping other people to understand, and that is an impossible job. The world is so big, and people are so full of violence that it seems the calamity is not coming from outside, but it is the accumulated violence in people themselves that is going to explode this earth.\nBut don’t think in terms of helping. Then you will not feel helpless and you will not feel tense. I don’t feel helpless, I don’t feel tense, I don’t feel any anguish – and I am more aware of it than you can be – because my approach is not of helping anybody, but just for you to raise your own consciousness to the highest peak possible... of which you are perfectly capable.\nIf we can create only two hundred enlightened people in the world, the world can be saved.\nKaveesha was born in a Jewish family, hence she will understand a beautiful story. In the OLD TESTAMENT it is mentioned that there were two cities, Sodom and Gomorrah, and both became sexually perverted. In Gomorrah, homosexuality was so prevalent, and in Sodom people had fallen even lower in their perversion: they were making love to animals. Hence, the English word “sodomy” – it comes from the city of Sodom. And God decided to destroy those two cities completely.\nHe destroyed those two cities completely – and it is very strange that those two cities had the same population as Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Hiroshima and Nagasaki were destroyed by man, but the OLD TESTAMENT story is that God destroyed those two sexually perverted cities. What I am going to tell you is a Hassidic story based on the OLD TESTAMENT version of the destruction by God of two sexually perverted cities.\nJudaism has blossomed in its totality in Hassidism. Hassidism is a rebellious, and essentially religious, phenomenon. All the religions have given to the world something beautiful – although those religions were against that something beautiful – except Christianity.\nMohammedanism has given Sufism, although Mohammedans have killed Sufis. Buddhism has given Zen, although Buddhists don’t accept Zen as an authentic teaching of Gautam Buddham. Hinduism has given Tantra, but Hindus are very much against Tantra – and that is their very truth. It is a very strange thing... and the same is the situation with Judaism.\nHassidism is a small, rebellious phenomenon within the world of Judaism. The man who founded Hassidism was Baal Shemtov. He also relates the story and you can see the beauty and the difference. Somebody asked him, “What do you think about Sodom and Gomorrah?”\nAnd Baal Shem said, “That story is not written in its completion. I will tell you the whole story.” And he said, “When God declared that he was going to destroy these two cities, one Hassid, a mystic, approached God and asked him, ‘If in these cities there are one hundred people who have experienced you, what will you do with these one hundred people? Are you going to destroy them too, with the whole cities?’\n“For a moment God was silent and then he said, ‘No. If there were one hundred awakened souls in these two cities, because of those one hundred people these two cities would be saved; I would not destroy them.’\n“The Hassid mystic said, ‘If there were only fifty, not a hundred? Will you destroy these cities, and those fifty awakened people?’\n“Now God saw that he had been caught by the mystic. He said, ‘No, I cannot destroy fifty awakened people.’ And the Hassid said, ‘I want you to know that there is only one man who is awakened; six months he lives in Sodom and six months he lives in Gomorrah. What do you say about it? – Will you destroy the cities?’\n“God said, ‘You are a very cunning fellow. Who is this man?’ He said of course, ‘I am.’\n“And God could not deny him because it is not a question of quantity, it is a question of quality: one awakened person or one hundred awakened persons. The awakened person cannot be destroyed by existence, because the awakened person is the longest dream of existence itself, the deepest longing of existence itself – to reach to the stars.” And Baal Shem said that Sodom and Gomorrah were never destroyed.\nJews are angry about Baal Shem, that he is just inventing this story; the whole story is written in the OLD TESTAMENT. The Jews don’t accept the Hassids as authentic Jews. In the same way, everywhere the really religious person will be condemned by the so-called religious.\nWhether Baal Shem invented the story or whether he was telling the true story, I am with him. In the first place a God who believes in destruction is not a God. A God who cannot transform people from their perversions is not a God. Baal Shem is not only saving those two cities, he is also saving God’s godliness: his compassion, his love, his understanding.\nKaveesha, forget all about the world. You become the one Hassid, the one mystic. And if we can create around the world just two hundred enlightened peopleThat number is also exactly like Baal\nShem’s Hassid. When he started talking with God, negotiating, it was only a question of two cities. The world has become big and it is a question of the whole world – so I am starting negotiating with two hundred. But I want to tell you that even two enlightened people will be enough, and the world will be saved; because existence cannot destroy its own ultimate flowering.\nSo you forget about the world; otherwise it will create unnecessary anxiety and will destroy your own awakening, which is the only possibility to save the world.\nAnybody who wants to help the world should forget about the world and concentrate upon himself. Raise your consciousness to such a height that existence has to think a second time whether to destroy this world or to save it.\nThe masses as they are don’t matter; existence will not care about them. In fact, existence would like this whole humanity – this rotten humanity – to be destroyed, so that evolution can start from scratch again. Something has gone wrong.…\nBut if there are a few enlightened people, they are far weightier than billions and billions of people on the earth. Existence cannot destroy the world – not only because of those few people who are enlightened; but because of their enlightenment, the unconscious masses also become valuable, because it is from these unconscious masses that those Himalayan peaks have arisen. They were also unconscious yesterday, today they are conscious. And existence is very patient: if it sees that unconscious people can become fully conscious, then this great mass of people, which is absolutely unconscious, also has a possibility.\nI depend on the individuals, not on the collectivity. The collectivity is so rotten that it will be an act of compassion to destroy it. But we have to prove that out of this unconscious, almost dead humanity, a few lotuses can blossom. Then, just given time, perhaps more lotuses will be coming. Some may be just buds, some may be just in the seed; but even if there is one man who is enlightened, with him the whole of humanity becomes valuable, because that man shows the hope that every man is capable of the same miracle.\nSo, Kaveesha, forget about helping. You cannot help; nobody can help. But you can become a mystic, a Hassid, and you can argue with God, that “I am here; are you going to destroy me? And these people who are somnambulists, walking in their sleep – I was also one of them. That is my yesterday. These people should be given their tomorrows. There is every possibility that every human being can become a Gautam Buddha.”\nThis is the only way to save this beautiful planet earth. Question 4\nBELOVED OSHO,\nI’VE BEEN WITH YOU FOR TWELVE YEARS, LISTENING TO YOU ANSWERING THOUSANDS OF QUESTIONS. THE QUESTIONS ALL SOUND VERY SIMILAR, YET YOUR ANSWERS WITH EACH OF THEM ARE SO NEW, SO FRESH, SO CRYSTAL CLEAR. EVEN THOUGH YOU HAVE SAID EVERYTHING THAT IS POSSIBLE TO BE EXPRESSED THROUGH WORDS, I HEAR EVERYTHING AS IF IT IS FOR THE FIRST TIME, AS IF I HAVE NEVER HEARD IT EVER BEFORE. EVEN THOUGH WORDS REPEAT, IT NEVER FEELS LIKE REPETITION. IT IS LIKE FLOATING IN A COOL, CLEAR, MOUNTAIN LAKE, THAT I COME OUT OF TOTALLY FRESH, CLEAN AND CLEAR. OSHO, YOU ARE SUCH A WONDERFUL MYSTERY TO ME, ALWAYS CATCHING ME BY SURPRISE AND IN AWE AND WONDER.\nPrem Turiya, you have heard many people, you have read many people; but hearing me or reading me is a totally different experience, for the simple reason that I am not a speaker, an orator, a lecturer.\nYour questions may be the same, but my answers cannot be the same for two reasons. First, I have forgotten your questions and my answers – I cannot repeat, I am not a gramophone record. Secondly, your questions may be the same, but the questioners are different – and I answer the questioner, not the question.\nNaturally, words will be repeated. Somebody has counted that I have answered fifteen thousand questions, and I am not a learned man; my vocabulary is very limited. But because I am not\nanswering the question, even though the words may be the same, the answer has a different nuance every time. Not that I am making an effort not to repeat myself... I don’t remember at all, I have never read any of my books.\nEach time when I am answering you, I am never prepared for it. I don’t know myself what is going to be my next sentence. It is not ordinary speaking; it is a communion, not only communication. I have nothing to communicate. I am not trying to convince you about something – because if I am trying to convince you, then the only way is to repeat the same thing again and again and again so it becomes a conditioning in your mind.\nMy words are not important. What is important is your silent listening. What is important is that my words are not coming from the mind, but from my deepest silence. Although they cannot contain silence, when they come from the deepest silence something of that silence surrounds them. They cannot contain it, but something of the silence surrounds them. It is as if you have taken a bath in a lake; you cannot contain the lake, but when you come out of it, something of the lake – the freshness, the coolness – comes with you. The lake is left behind, but some quality of the lake is carried with you.\nYou are listening in silence; I am speaking in silence. My words reach to you with some freshness, with some fragrance; and because you are silent, that fragrance, that silence, deepens your silence – makes it fragrant.\nIt is very difficult for intellectuals to understand what is happening. It is a very non-intellectual, heart-to-heart communion. Words are only excuses.\nI would love to sit silently with you, but then you cannot be silent. If I am silent, then your mind will go on: yakkety-yak, yakkety-yak. Just to save you from trouble, I have to speak, and because I am speaking, your mind becomes engaged in listening. It forgets its own yakkety-yak, or postpones it.\nIt is certainly a miracle. And these are authentic miracles, not miracles like Jesus walking on the water.\nI have heard a story: Two rabbis and one bishop were very great friends. All three had gone fishing on the same lake where Jesus used to walk – Lake Galilee.\nThe bishop was an American; those two rabbis were local Jews. Talking about Jesus, one rabbi said, “You Christians make too much of small things. Here, everybody knows how to walk on water.”\nThe bishop said, “Everybody...? You can walk on water?”\nThe rabbi said, “Of course,” and he stepped over the side of the boat and walked on water.\nThe bishop could not believe his eyes.… He is a Jew, he does not even believe in Christ! These are the people who crucified Jesus. This is absolutely unfair of God – that even rabbis should be allowed to do miracles.\nThe first rabbi came back. The bishop asked the second rabbi, “Can you also walk?”\nHe said, “Everybody can walk. You have unnecessarily made too much fuss about Jesus – that he walked on water. In Israel, everybody walks on water.”\nThe bishop said, “This is a new thing; I have never heard of it. Just show me that you can also walk on water.” And the second rabbi stepped out of the boat and walked on water. The bishop looked with unblinking eyes – he even forgot to breathe.\nAnd the second rabbi came back, and both of them said, “Now, you are a follower of Jesus; you can try. Do you trust Jesus?”\nThe bishop said, “Absolutely.” Then they said, “You can try.”\nSo the bishop stepped out on his side – this was the other side of the boat – and started drowning.

PROTECT MYSELF, AND WHO I’M PROTECTING MYSELF FROM. I FIND IT EXPRESSES
ITSELF THROUGH ARROGANCE, AND THE SAFETY OF ONLY WANTING TO STAY ON THE
SIDE OF THE GIVER. I FEEL LIKE A ROCKET WHICH IS ALL PREPARED TO BE
LAUNCHED: ALL THE SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN CLEARED BUT ONE LOCK IS STILL ON –
THE LOCK OF PROTECTION.</p><p><br></p><p>OSHO, WOULD YOU SHOW ME THE KEY TO UNLOCK PROTECTION – OR IS THERE NO
LOCK?</p><p><br></p><p>David, man is born with death in his heart. As he grows, death also
grows. Life and death are almost like two wings. The day life has
reached to its peak, death also reaches its peak; hence the unknown
fear, and the desire to be protected.</p><p><br></p><p>But there is only one way to unlock – only one key. This desire to be
protected can disappear only when you understand that the life that you
have known is not the eternal life. The dewdrop has to die; there is no
way of protecting it.</p><p><br></p><p>But in the death of the dewdrop is a new beginning. It is not an end;
it is the beginning of the very ocean. The dewdrop becomes the ocean.
Then all fears – of insecurity, of death, of disease, of old age – they
all disappear together.</p><p>But man goes on doing just the opposite. Seeing that there is a
desire to be protected, he tries to find all kinds of protection – in
money, in power, in respectability. But the longing is simply the same:
somehow I should be so powerful and so secure that the fear of the
unknown, of death, can be forgotten.</p><p><br></p><p>But there is no way to forget it. You can get busy with thousands of
things, but it is always there like an undercurrent – because it is a
natural phenomenon. Death is not something that is going to come from
outside.</p><p><br></p><p>I have always loved an old parable: A king was very much afraid of
death. He had conquered many lands, he was a great warrior, he was
adequately safe, secure – there was no need to be afraid. But the
problem is: death does not come from outside – it grows within you. You
bring it with your birth.</p><p><br></p><p>But nobody told him this; on the contrary, his advisers told him,
“You should make a palace in which there should be no windows, no doors
– just one door, and on that door there should be seven-fold security.
One guard – but who can trust? – then another guard to guard the first
guard, and so on. Seven lines of guards... you will be absolutely
protected.”</p><p><br></p><p>He made the palace. The idea looked logical; but all that is logical
is not realistic – logic is not equivalent to life. The palace was made.
The king was very happy, the guarding system was so secure. There was
only one door; no enemy could enter from anywhere.</p><p><br></p><p>One of his friends, another king, heard about the palace and came to
see it. He was immensely impressed. It was a piece of art inside, was
made all of marble, and everything for the king’s pleasure was there:
beautiful fountains, waterfalls – but everything was inside the palace.
The friend said, “I would like a palace just like this in my own
kingdom. It feels so secure.”</p><p><br></p><p>As he was leaving, the host king came out, and the friend thanked him
again. As he was getting into his golden chariot he said, “I am
immensely grateful, because you have made something which is really
secure. Just help me with your architects and the stonecutters; I want
to make exactly the same palace in my kingdom.”</p><p><br></p><p>Just then a beggar sitting in the street started laughing. Both the
kings felt embarrassed, and the host asked the beggar, “Why are you
laughing?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Once I used to be a king myself, but just to find security
I became a beggar. Since I have become a beggar, nobody is interested in
killing me. I sleep in the street without any fear. I have one
suggestion to make to you – and I am older than both of you, and my
kingdom was far bigger than your kingdoms.</p><p><br></p><p>“My suggestion is that there is a flaw in your palace. I have been
sitting here and watching – but nobody has bothered about the flaw.”</p><p><br></p><p>The king said, “What flaw?”</p><p><br></p><p>The beggar said, “There is one door. The best security will be for
you to get in and let your stonecutters close the door. Instead of a
door there should be a beautiful marble wall. Then nobody can enter
there.</p><p>“Even these seven lines of guards can conspire – it is not
inconceivable – to acquire the whole kingdom. You are in the hands of
these seven men. If they join together, they can kill you and divide
your whole kingdom. And it is such a simple thing it that is bound to
come into their minds. You think you are secure – you are more insecure
than ever; you are just in the hands of seven people.”</p><p><br></p><p>The king said, “Your idea is right – but what is the point of living
if there is no door to come out?”</p><p><br></p><p>And the beggar laughed again. He said, “You need not come out. Death
can enter without a door – because in fact it does not enter from the
outside; it is sitting within you, just like a seed.”</p><p><br></p><p>You may not be very conscious, David, nobody is very conscious – that
you are dying every day, inch by inch. And one day the process is
complete. Death is not an incident, but a process: it has the same
length as your life. If you are going to live seventy or eighty years,
your death also has eighty years to live with you.</p><p><br></p><p>This life – what we understand as life – is in the hands of death,
and there is no way of protection. But I know a golden key, which is to
find in yourself a deeper layer of life, deeper than this life and
deeper than this death. That deepest layer is eternal. There is no need
to protect it; it is protected by the whole of existence itself. There
is a lock, and that is your mind, which prevents your going in. And
there is a key: I call it meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>Before meditation, the mind disappears. Not that the lock is
opened... but the lock simply disappears, and you enter into your
kingdom of eternity. And only then does one feel secure.</p><p><br></p><p>Even if death comes, and it is bound to come, you will be watching
it: you will not be dying. Your body will be dying, your mind will be
dying, but before death you have already abandoned them. You have gone
deeper than both the superficial layers.</p><p><br></p><p>Except through meditation, nobody has come to know about eternity,
about immortality, about the timelessness of our being. Therefore to me
religion simply means meditation. Anything else is superfluous,
nonessential.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the miracle of meditation: that it does not divide people.
There is no Christian meditation, there is no Hindu meditation, there is
no Mohammedan meditation, and there is no Jewish meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation is a science.</p><p><br></p><p>All that is nonessential in religions divides people; and the
non-essential becomes so big, so heavy, that the small key of meditation
is lost or forgotten.</p><p><br></p><p>People feel offended with me, annoyed with me, irritated, because I
want them not to be Hindus, not to be Christians, not to be Jainas – but
only to be meditators... because meditation is the only essential
religion that can join you to your real self.</p><p><br></p><p>The word “religion” has to be understood. It means “bringing
together.” You have gone far away from yourself. To bring you back
together with your reality is the only religion there is.</p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>EVERY DAY I COME OUT OF YOUR DISCOURSE, HAVING BEEN SITTING WITH YOU,
LISTENING TO YOUR VOICE AND DANCING TO YOUR MUSIC. COMING OUT OF THE
GATE THE WORLD LOOKS SO FRESH, THE GREEN SO DEEP AND SHINY, THE PLAY OF
THE SUN WITH THE SHADOW SO RICH, AND THE PEOPLE SOFT AND OPEN. BELOVED
MASTER, WHAT’S THE MAGIC YOU USE IN CLEANING MY EYES? IS IT THIS OR IS
NATURE REJOICING TOO IN THE PRESENCE OF SUCH A BEAUTIFUL MASTER AND
SHOWING ITS MOST CELEBRATIVE AND BEAUTIFUL SIDE TO US? IS THIS YOUR
BUDDHAFIELD FLOWING THROUGH EVERYBODY AND EVERYTHING PRESENT HERE?</p><p>Anand Premartha, it is both. Sitting here in silence, being showered
by my silence, my serenity, everything in you becomes fresh, young.
Silence is such a shower of the soul.</p><p>Listening to the music – not only listening, but participating,
almost dancing with joy – you forget your ordinary worries and the
world, the tensions and anxieties; those are the layers of dust on your
eyes.</p><p>And just being with me here, something that is not visible to the
eyes transpires between me and you. Some energy, which can only be
called divine, passes from heart to heart. I can see that there are
moments when you all disappear, and only one consciousness remains. You
forget your individuality, your separateness. And this is such a
rejuvenation, such a refreshment, such a rebirth, that when you go out –
things are the same – but the green looks greener; the people look
softer and more loving. The song of the birds, although meaningless,
starts having a significance of its own. All your senses are at their
maximum sensitivity. The light passing through the trees fills you with
wonder. The wind passing through the trees whispers unknown secrets to
you.</p><p>So on the one hand you are ready, available, fresh, rested, relaxed,
and silent; and on the other hand you are part of existence. Existence
rejoices with you. It is not only that your eyes are fresh and your mind
is silent, that the trees are greener – that is only one part of the
story.</p><p>The other part is that because of your silence, because of your
dance, because of your music, they really are greener – just for you, a
special gift.</p><p>It is said that whenever Gautam Buddha passed by any path, even if it
was not the time for the trees to blossom, they blossomed. Buddhists
have not been able to explain it; no scientific explanation is possible.
Only a mystic can understand it; only a meditator can understand what it
means – that trees which were without leaves immediately started growing
leaves and foliage, preparing a little shadow for the tired Buddha to
rest under.</p><p>That is what you are experiencing: existence certainly rejoices when
you are blissful. Existence is almost an echo of your being. If you are
in anxiety, everything around you becomes tense; and if you are silent,
everything around you becomes a silent music, a silent dance.</p><p>Remember that you are not separate from existence; so when you are
happy, all these trees are also happy. Happiness is contagious. When you
are dancing, these trees are also moving in rhythm with you.</p><p>When you are full of love whoever meets you – he may be a very
primitive, crude man, but your love is more powerful than any crudeness,
any primitiveness... with you, suddenly he feels he is becoming
soft.</p><p><br></p><p>You have known this experience in many other ways. There are people
with whom you become sad. They have not done anything to you and they
have not said anything to you, but their sadness is so heavy and so
powerful. We are continuously broadcasting our hearts all around us.</p><p><br></p><p>If a sad man passes by, his sadness is going to touch your heart too,
unless your joyfulness is bigger than his sadness; then he will be
touched. And you know about people with whom you suddenly become joyous
for no reason at all, just being with them it feels as if a certain joy,
a certain happiness has entered into you.</p><p><br></p><p>But listening to me is nothing but a meditation. This is my simplest
device, in which you have not to do anything at all. I tell you to
meditate, but I cannot leave it to you. You may think, “Yes, I will
meditate,” and you go on postponing. That is why every morning and
evening I speak to you. It does not matter what I say. I am not an
orator, neither am I a preacher, nor am I giving you a doctrine or a
philosophy. This is a device: because you want to listen to me, you are
bound to be silent. Without your knowing, you are falling deeper and
deeper into your being.</p><p><br></p><p>So when you go out, you have not gone out of a lecture hall. This
Chuang Tzu hall is not a lecture hall, it is a place – a temple – of
meditation. That’s why I always go on leaving gaps for you: in those
gaps there is every possibility you may touch your innermost core.</p><p><br></p><p>So don’t say after “listening” to me, say after “meditating” with me,
when you go out all your senses are more sensitive. And the whole of
existence rejoices because you have a totally different fragrance, a
different presence. You carry something of me with you every day.</p><p><br></p><p>Slowly, slowly you will be able to sit by yourself alone, doing
nothing, sitting silently. And in that silence, you will know all the
mysteries of existence.</p><p><br></p><p>This is one of the mysteries: that everything is interconnected. Your
joy is felt by the trees – your sadness too. Your silence is experienced
by the birds – your dance, your music too.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 3 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>MANY TIMES IN MY MEDITATION I ASKED YOU NOT TO SHOW ME DIRECTLY THE
TREMENDOUS TRAGEDY THAT IS HAPPENING ON EARTH TODAY, AS I KNOW I COULD
NEVER TOLERATE SUCH SUFFERING. YET I’M SENSING THIS ALL THE TIME, EVEN
WITH MY BUFFERS. I KNOW YOU ARE THE LIGHT FOR THIS WHOLE PLANET, AND
KNOWING THIS CARRIES SUCH A RESPONSIBILITY. I WOULD BE SO GRATEFUL TO
HEAR YOU SPEAK TO ME ON HELPING, KNOWING I CAN’T HELP, AND THE ANGST OF
FEELING HELPLESS – AND ALSO OF RELAXING WHEN FEELING SUCH A STATE OF
URGENCY.</p><p><br></p><p>Prem Kaveesha, I can understand your anguish about the whole of
humanity, about this planet earth; because every day we are coming
closer and closer to a disaster.</p><p>It is because the disaster is coming very close; even with your
buffers you cannot forget it – and it hurts. And it hurts more because
you feel you cannot help; you cannot do anything. It is simply beyond
the capacity of any individual to prevent this calamity, this disaster,
this global suicide that seems to be almost certain. But I have a way of
my own.</p><p><br></p><p>You feel helpless because you think in terms of helping other people
to understand, and that is an impossible job. The world is so big, and
people are so full of violence that it seems the calamity is not coming
from outside, but it is the accumulated violence in people themselves
that is going to explode this earth.</p><p><br></p><p>But don’t think in terms of helping. Then you will not feel helpless
and you will not feel tense. I don’t feel helpless, I don’t feel tense,
I don’t feel any anguish – and I am more aware of it than you can be –
because my approach is not of helping anybody, but just for you to raise
your own consciousness to the highest peak possible... of which you are
perfectly capable.</p><p><br></p><p>If we can create only two hundred enlightened people in the world,
the world can be saved.</p><p><br></p><p>Kaveesha was born in a Jewish family, hence she will understand a
beautiful story. In the OLD TESTAMENT it is mentioned that there were
two cities, Sodom and Gomorrah, and both became sexually perverted. In
Gomorrah, homosexuality was so prevalent, and in Sodom people had fallen
even lower in their perversion: they were making love to animals. Hence,
the English word “sodomy” – it comes from the city of Sodom. And God
decided to destroy those two cities completely.</p><p><br></p><p>He destroyed those two cities completely – and it is very strange
that those two cities had the same population as Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
Hiroshima and Nagasaki were destroyed by man, but the OLD TESTAMENT
story is that God destroyed those two sexually perverted cities. What I
am going to tell you is a Hassidic story based on the OLD TESTAMENT
version of the destruction by God of two sexually perverted cities.</p><p><br></p><p>Judaism has blossomed in its totality in Hassidism. Hassidism is a
rebellious, and essentially religious, phenomenon. All the religions
have given to the world something beautiful – although those religions
were against that something beautiful – except Christianity.</p><p><br></p><p>Mohammedanism has given Sufism, although Mohammedans have killed
Sufis. Buddhism has given Zen, although Buddhists don’t accept Zen as an
authentic teaching of Gautam Buddham. Hinduism has given Tantra, but
Hindus are very much against Tantra – and that is their very truth. It
is a very strange thing... and the same is the situation with
Judaism.</p><p><br></p><p>Hassidism is a small, rebellious phenomenon within the world of
Judaism. The man who founded Hassidism was Baal Shemtov. He also relates
the story and you can see the beauty and the difference. Somebody asked
him, “What do you think about Sodom and Gomorrah?”</p><p><br></p><p>And Baal Shem said, “That story is not written in its completion. I
will tell you the whole story.” And he said, “When God declared that he
was going to destroy these two cities, one Hassid, a mystic, approached
God and asked him, ‘If in these cities there are one hundred people who
have experienced you, what will you do with these one hundred people?
Are you going to destroy them too, with the whole cities?’</p><p>“For a moment God was silent and then he said, ‘No. If there were one
hundred awakened souls in these two cities, because of those one hundred
people these two cities would be saved; I would not destroy them.’</p><p><br></p><p>“The Hassid mystic said, ‘If there were only fifty, not a hundred?
Will you destroy these cities, and those fifty awakened people?’</p><p><br></p><p>“Now God saw that he had been caught by the mystic. He said, ‘No, I
cannot destroy fifty awakened people.’ And the Hassid said, ‘I want you
to know that there is only one man who is awakened; six months he lives
in Sodom and six months he lives in Gomorrah. What do you say about it?
– Will you destroy the cities?’</p><p><br></p><p>“God said, ‘You are a very cunning fellow. Who is this man?’ He said
of course, ‘I am.’</p><p><br></p><p>“And God could not deny him because it is not a question of quantity,
it is a question of quality: one awakened person or one hundred awakened
persons. The awakened person cannot be destroyed by existence, because
the awakened person is the longest dream of existence itself, the
deepest longing of existence itself – to reach to the stars.” And Baal
Shem said that Sodom and Gomorrah were never destroyed.</p><p><br></p><p>Jews are angry about Baal Shem, that he is just inventing this story;
the whole story is written in the OLD TESTAMENT. The Jews don’t accept
the Hassids as authentic Jews. In the same way, everywhere the really
religious person will be condemned by the so-called religious.</p><p><br></p><p>Whether Baal Shem invented the story or whether he was telling the
true story, I am with him. In the first place a God who believes in
destruction is not a God. A God who cannot transform people from their
perversions is not a God. Baal Shem is not only saving those two cities,
he is also saving God’s godliness: his compassion, his love, his
understanding.</p><p><br></p><p>Kaveesha, forget all about the world. You become the one Hassid, the
one mystic. And if we can create around the world just two hundred
enlightened people<span class=s4></span>That number is also exactly
like Baal</p><p>Shem’s Hassid. When he started talking with God, negotiating, it was
only a question of two cities. The world has become big and it is a
question of the whole world – so I am starting negotiating with two
hundred. But I want to tell you that even two enlightened people will be
enough, and the world will be saved; because existence cannot destroy
its own ultimate flowering.</p><p><br></p><p>So you forget about the world; otherwise it will create unnecessary
anxiety and will destroy your own awakening, which is the only
possibility to save the world.</p><p><br></p><p>Anybody who wants to help the world should forget about the world and
concentrate upon himself. Raise your consciousness to such a height that
existence has to think a second time whether to destroy this world or to
save it.</p><p><br></p><p>The masses as they are don’t matter; existence will not care about
them. In fact, existence would like this whole humanity – this rotten
humanity – to be destroyed, so that evolution can start from scratch
again. Something has gone wrong.…</p><p>But if there are a few enlightened people, they are far weightier
than billions and billions of people on the earth. Existence cannot
destroy the world – not only because of those few people who are
enlightened; but because of their enlightenment, the unconscious masses
also become valuable, because it is from these unconscious masses that
those Himalayan peaks have arisen. They were also unconscious yesterday,
today they are conscious. And existence is very patient: if it sees that
unconscious people can become fully conscious, then this great mass of
people, which is absolutely unconscious, also has a possibility.</p><p><br></p><p>I depend on the individuals, not on the collectivity. The
collectivity is so rotten that it will be an act of compassion to
destroy it. But we have to prove that out of this unconscious, almost
dead humanity, a few lotuses can blossom. Then, just given time, perhaps
more lotuses will be coming. Some may be just buds, some may be just in
the seed; but even if there is one man who is enlightened, with him the
whole of humanity becomes valuable, because that man shows the hope that
every man is capable of the same miracle.</p><p><br></p><p>So, Kaveesha, forget about helping. You cannot help; nobody can help.
But you can become a mystic, a Hassid, and you can argue with God, that
“I am here; are you going to destroy me? And these people who are
somnambulists, walking in their sleep – I was also one of them. That is
my yesterday. These people should be given their tomorrows. There is
every possibility that every human being can become a Gautam
Buddha.”</p><p><br></p><p>This is the only way to save this beautiful planet earth. Question
4</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>I’VE BEEN WITH YOU FOR TWELVE YEARS, LISTENING TO YOU ANSWERING
THOUSANDS OF QUESTIONS. THE QUESTIONS ALL SOUND VERY SIMILAR, YET YOUR
ANSWERS WITH EACH OF THEM ARE SO NEW, SO FRESH, SO CRYSTAL CLEAR. EVEN
THOUGH YOU HAVE SAID EVERYTHING THAT IS POSSIBLE TO BE EXPRESSED THROUGH
WORDS, I HEAR EVERYTHING AS IF IT IS FOR THE FIRST TIME, AS IF I HAVE
NEVER HEARD IT EVER BEFORE. EVEN THOUGH WORDS REPEAT, IT NEVER FEELS
LIKE REPETITION. IT IS LIKE FLOATING IN A COOL, CLEAR, MOUNTAIN LAKE,
THAT I COME OUT OF TOTALLY FRESH, CLEAN AND CLEAR. OSHO, YOU ARE SUCH A
WONDERFUL MYSTERY TO ME, ALWAYS CATCHING ME BY SURPRISE AND IN AWE AND
WONDER.</p><p><br></p><p>Prem Turiya, you have heard many people, you have read many people;
but hearing me or reading me is a totally different experience, for the
simple reason that I am not a speaker, an orator, a lecturer.</p><p><br></p><p>Your questions may be the same, but my answers cannot be the same for
two reasons. First, I have forgotten your questions and my answers – I
cannot repeat, I am not a gramophone record. Secondly, your questions
may be the same, but the questioners are different – and I answer the
questioner, not the question.</p><p><br></p><p>Naturally, words will be repeated. Somebody has counted that I have
answered fifteen thousand questions, and I am not a learned man; my
vocabulary is very limited. But because I am not</p><p>answering the question, even though the words may be the same, the
answer has a different nuance every time. Not that I am making an effort
not to repeat myself... I don’t remember at all, I have never read any
of my books.</p><p><br></p><p>Each time when I am answering you, I am never prepared for it. I
don’t know myself what is going to be my next sentence. It is not
ordinary speaking; it is a communion, not only communication. I have
nothing to communicate. I am not trying to convince you about something
– because if I am trying to convince you, then the only way is to repeat
the same thing again and again and again so it becomes a conditioning in
your mind.</p><p><br></p><p>My words are not important. What is important is your silent
listening. What is important is that my words are not coming from the
mind, but from my deepest silence. Although they cannot contain silence,
when they come from the deepest silence something of that silence
surrounds them. They cannot contain it, but something of the silence
surrounds them. It is as if you have taken a bath in a lake; you cannot
contain the lake, but when you come out of it, something of the lake –
the freshness, the coolness – comes with you. The lake is left behind,
but some quality of the lake is carried with you.</p><p><br></p><p>You are listening in silence; I am speaking in silence. My words
reach to you with some freshness, with some fragrance; and because you
are silent, that fragrance, that silence, deepens your silence – makes
it fragrant.</p><p><br></p><p>It is very difficult for intellectuals to understand what is
happening. It is a very non-intellectual, heart-to-heart communion.
Words are only excuses.</p><p><br></p><p>I would love to sit silently with you, but then you cannot be silent.
If I am silent, then your mind will go on: yakkety-yak, yakkety-yak.
Just to save you from trouble, I have to speak, and because I am
speaking, your mind becomes engaged in listening. It forgets its own
yakkety-yak, or postpones it.</p><p><br></p><p>It is certainly a miracle. And these are authentic miracles, not
miracles like Jesus walking on the water.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard a story: Two rabbis and one bishop were very great
friends. All three had gone fishing on the same lake where Jesus used to
walk – Lake Galilee.</p><p><br></p><p>The bishop was an American; those two rabbis were local Jews. Talking
about Jesus, one rabbi said, “You Christians make too much of small
things. Here, everybody knows how to walk on water.”</p><p><br></p><p>The bishop said, “Everybody...? You can walk on water?”</p><p><br></p><p>The rabbi said, “Of course,” and he stepped over the side of the boat
and walked on water.</p><p><br></p><p>The bishop could not believe his eyes.… He is a Jew, he does not even
believe in Christ! These are the people who crucified Jesus. This is
absolutely unfair of God – that even rabbis should be allowed to do
miracles.</p><p><br></p><p>The first rabbi came back. The bishop asked the second rabbi, “Can
you also walk?”</p><p>He said, “Everybody can walk. You have unnecessarily made too much
fuss about Jesus – that he walked on water. In Israel, everybody walks
on water.”</p><p><br></p><p>The bishop said, “This is a new thing; I have never heard of it. Just
show me that you can also walk on water.” And the second rabbi stepped
out of the boat and walked on water. The bishop looked with unblinking
eyes – he even forgot to breathe.</p><p><br></p><p>And the second rabbi came back, and both of them said, “Now, you are
a follower of Jesus; you can try. Do you trust Jesus?”</p><p><br></p><p>The bishop said, “Absolutely.” Then they said, “You can try.”</p><p>So the bishop stepped out on his side – this was the other side of
the boat – and started drowning. One rabbi said, “What do you think,
should we tell that American idiot where the stones are?”</p><p><br></p><p>Local people know where the rocks are. These are not miracles. The
real miracle happens almost invisibly. Your being silent here... just
listening to the birds: tweet, toot, toot – it is a miracle.</p><p><br></p><p>Okay, Vimal?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, Osho.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part13>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

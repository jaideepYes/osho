IN THOSE MOMENTS IT FEELS AS IF WE ARE ALL SHARING A CUP OF DIVINE CHAMPAGNE, AND IN THIS REJOICING WE LOSE OURSELVES AND COME CLOSE TO YOU.

IN THOSE MOMENTS IT FEELS AS IF WE ARE ALL SHARING A CUP OF DIVINE CHAMPAGNE, AND IN THIS REJOICING WE LOSE OURSELVES AND COME CLOSE TO YOU. THANK YOU OSHO.\nPrem Vishva, laughter has never been accepted by any religion of the world as a spiritual quality. As far as I am concerned, it is one of the most important spiritual qualities for the very simple reason that when you are in total laughter your ego disappears. The laughter is: you are not.\nAnd if this is not being spiritual, then nothing else can be. It is because of this that when you laugh together, you melt into each other, and you melt with me.\nSmall egos disappear like dewdrops in the early morning sun.\nThe mind has never been able to laugh: it is basically serious; it is basically pathological. The moment you laugh, suddenly you are not functioning from the mind center anymore, you start functioning from the heart center. And if the laughter is really total you can even go deeper than the heart: you can reach to the very center of your being. It can give you a glimpse of truth, of beauty, of the celebrating existence. That’s why I love to see you laugh as much as possible.\nAnd you are right: “In those moments it feels as if we are all sharing a cup of divine champagne.” It is not “as if”... you are really sharing a cup of divine champagne. “And in this rejoicing we lose ourselves and come close to You” – not only close, you can become one with me.\nTo be close is also to be distant; to be close is also to be separate. Love is never fulfilled by just closeness; it is fulfilled only when boundaries disappear, and merging and melting happens.\nPrem Vishva, for you especially, I am telling this joke. A very famous Zulu warrior went to the king of Zululand to ask for the hand of the King’s daughter in marriage. The King said, “No man can marry my daughter unless he can first carry out three tasks which I have set.”\nThe warrior said, “Just tell them, O King, and I will do them immediately.”\nThe king said, “I have set aside three tents. In the first tent is a large barrel of alcohol: you must drink it all in one breath. You must immediately go to the second tent, in which there is a seven-foot gorilla who is crazy with toothache; you must find his bad tooth and pull it out with your bare hands. In the third tent, which you must go to immediately after, is an English lady who has been specially trained not to have an orgasm. You must satisfy her totally!”\n“Yes, my King,” said the warrior. He went inside the first tent and drank the full barrel of alcohol in one mighty effort. He staggered out and went immediately into the next tent containing the mad gorilla. There was a terrible fight, the tent shook and the air was rent with screams and howling, large pieces of fur came flying out of the door, and a human ear.\nThe roaring and shouting went on for twenty minutes. Then the blood-soaked warrior crawled out, staggered to his feet, and said, “Okay, your kingship, now show me where the English lady with the toothache is.”\nQuestion 2 BELOVED OSHO,\nI FEEL HALF-COOKED! ON THE ONE HAND I’M HAPPY, MORE BLESSED AND BLISSFUL, MORE LOVING AND LOVED THAN EVER BEFORE – AND I FEEL SO THRILLED ABOUT IT. AND ON THE OTHER HAND MY OLD COMPANIONS – JEALOUSY, COMPETITIVENESS, THE NEED TO BE IMPORTANT, SPECIAL – THEY ARE ALSO STILL AROUND, IN THE SAME POT. I DANCE AND CELEBRATE WITH LIGHTNESS AND JOY, AND WHEN THE FLASHES OF DARKNESS COME I RELAX AND ACCEPT AS MUCH AS I CAN AND I TRY TO REMAIN WATCHFUL.\nOSHO, SINCE SUPPOSEDLY I AM BOTH THE COOK AND THE COOKED, DO I NEED TO TURN UP THE FIRE? OR WOULD YOU ADVISE THAT I CONTINUE TO SIMMER SLOWLY? SOMEHOW, SIMMERING SLOWLY DOESN’T SEEM TO BE OUR WAY.…\nPrem Arup, simmering slowly is certainly not our way. And you are wrong about feeling that you are the cook and the cooked: I am the cook, you are the cooked. So please leave it to me; you just get relaxed and be cooked.\nYou say: “I feel half-cooked. On the one hand I am happy, more blessed and blissful, more loving and loved than ever before – and I feel so thrilled about it. And on the other hand my old companions – jealousy, competitiveness, the need to be important, special – they are also still around.”\nDon’t be worried about them, don’t take them seriously. The more you take them seriously, the more you nourish them. Let them be around: just be playful with them. Your blissfulness, your being more loved and more loving will take care of the whole thing.\nQualities like jealousy exist only when you are not loved, when you are not capable of loving. Competitiveness, the need to be important, special, they are all part of the same phenomenon: jealousy. They are not separate things, separate aspects. And if you are feeling blissful, happy, loved and loving, then there is no need to be worried: if you have light, the darkness will disappear on its own.\nThey are your old companions, so just out of habit they still come to see you. Be courteous; don’t be angry about them, and don’t try to push them away. Just watch – but watch joyously. Your watchfulness can also become serious, and that is a great problem: it should remain part of your playfulness... and jealousy cannot exist.\nAnd when you are blissful, who cares about being important? – you are important. And when you are loved and you are loving, who bothers about being special? These desires arise in people who don’t have any taste of bliss, any taste of love.\nIt is true you are half-cooked – because these things are still coming; but even being half-cooked is a great phenomenon. The rest will also happen. And that is not your responsibility: I am the cook here, and I have cooked so many people that you can trust me, Arup.\nQuestion 3 BELOVED OSHO,\nLOOKING BACK AT THIS PAST YEAR-AND-A-HALF SINCE I MET YOU, IT SEEMS THAT I AM FLYING OUT OF CONTROL.\nPEOPLE THINK I AM CRAZY, BUT I LAUGH AS I TEAR AWAY THE PIECES OF MY OLD LIFE. AND YOU’VE TOLD ME, THAT WAS JUST FOR STARTERS. MY MEDITATIONS ARE DIFFICULT... I AM SO EXCITED AND HIGH MOST OF THE TIME.\nMAYBE YOU WILL GIVE ME SOME CLUE TO QUIET THIS BOUNCING HEART.\nBELOVED MASTER, I’VE COME THIS FAR AND GIVEN UP THIS MUCH TO BE HERE NOW, TO TAKE SANNYAS AND SURRENDER – WHAT NOW?\nRich Frank, now you can retire. You have done the last thing – surrender. Now you are no longer there. Now it is my concern – you are completely free, because beyond surrender, there is nothing to be done.\nSurrender means that you have dropped the ego; and now “You are flying out of control.” It feels out of control because you have remained always in control. Now drop that control; now you are no longer the pilot; you have surrendered. And the sky is vast – there is no fear of your falling out of the sky.\nYou say that people think you are crazy. You are! I attract only crazy people. The so-called saints remain always at a distance.\nWhen I was a student at the university one of my professors told me that it would be a great act of compassion towards him if I didn’t come into his class: “As far as your attendance record is concerned, I will give you one hundred percent.”\nI said, “But what is the matter? I have joined the class, I have paid the fee for it.”\nHe said, “You can take the fee from me, but just the idea of having you for two years in the class drives me crazy. The moment I see you, something in me starts trembling.” And he was a very sane person, but people’s sanity is superficial: just a little scratch and they will go insane.\nI don’t want you to be superficially sane: I want you to drop all superficial sanity. Everybody will think you are crazy, but you are simply being natural; and nature is not crazy. To be natural is the authentic sanity: the more natural you become, the bigger will become the distance with the artificial society and the artificial people – but you will be becoming more and more sane.\nWhen you reach to the very core of your being, you have attained the final sanity; but in the eyes of other people you will look absolutely mad. People have created their own game of sanity, and if you break their rules, immediately they condemn you as crazy. I am not here to condemn you, but to transform you. Your craziness is the beginning of your authentic sanity.\nDon’t be worried about what people say; remember only how you feel yourself. If you are feeling joyous, drunk with blissfulness, there is no need for any control. Control is dangerous, because control means you are not allowing your nature its flow. Control means you are cutting off... trying to force yourself to be a certain way, the way others expect you to be. People give respectability and honor to those who are following the rules of their game; they will not give you respectability, and they will not give you honor. But to be crazy and natural is so valuable that these bogus values of honor, respectability, reputation, don’t have any meaning.\nYou cannot fly out of control; it is simply not possible. It is just that you have always remained in control, so just relaxing a little you become afraid.\nIt happened in the religious class of a small school: the teacher was telling the students to draw, according to them, the concept of God. She had been explaining to them the Christian concept of God.\nThe bishop had come to see how things are going in the class, and she wanted to show something from the small boys and girls.\nThey had all drawn pictures, and one small boy had drawn a picture of an airplane with four windows. Even the bishop was struck: what kind of an idea of God does he have? And from every window something looking like a man...?\nThe teacher said, “What is this? This is your idea of God?”\nThe boy said, “You have told us that God is a trinity: the first is God the Father – you can see... with the beard of ancient old age. In the second window is the son – you can even see the cross – Jesus Christ. In the third you don’t see any face because it is the holy ghost – just something like a whirlwind.”\nThe bishop and the teacher together asked him, “What about the fourth? From where has the fourth come?”\nThe little boy said, “The fourth?... Pontius the pilot. Without him the airplane will go out of control.”\nDon’t be worried; nature itself takes care of you. You relax... and that is the meaning of surrender: that you relax and you allow nature to take you wherever it wants to take you. You don’t have any plan, you don’t have any guidebook, you don’t have a certain goal, you don’t have any desire to reach somewhere; wherever nature takes you will be your home, will be your destiny.\nYou are also worried that “my meditations are difficult... I am so excited and high most of the time. Maybe You will give some clue to quiet this bouncing heart.” There is no clue; let it bounce as much as it can. And you are excited and high most of the time: enjoy it. Nobody can remain forever excited and high – and the more you are excited and high, the sooner you will be relaxed.\nAnd right now – when you are so excited and high, with a bouncing heart – if you try to meditate, you are just trying something which is against your nature at this moment. Forget meditation for the moment. Meditation will come; first get tired.\nWhen you are calm, you will see that meditation is happening. The heart is bouncing no more; you are not flying high; you are no longer excited; flat on the earth... and meditation begins. But first, let this whole energy be exhausted.\nI once lived with a friend for a few days. He had a small son so full of energy, that it was impossible to talk. He was jumping into everything, throwing things, putting on the radio. My friend said: “What to do with this boy? He is so full of energy”\nI said, “Don’t be worried.” I told the boy, “You just go around the house as many times as you can. Then you can ask for any reward, and I will give it to you.”\nHe said, “Promise?”\nI said, “Promise.” He could go only seven times around the house and then he was flat on the ground. I said, “What are you doing?”\nHe said, “Finished!”\nI said, “What about your reward?”\nHe said, “I will think later on. Right now, don’t disturb me.”\nHis father said, “Strange... I have been telling him continually, not to disturb me! It is the first time he has said ‘don’t disturb me!’”\nI said, “He has gone into meditation!”\nYou will also go into meditation. Everybody who is here is going to go into meditation, but first, jog and jump as high as you can; let your heart bounce... and don’t be worried: when the energy is moving high, you cannot relax.\nMany people asked me about the fact that they cannot sleep – and they have tried all kinds of methods: mantras, chanting, listening to music, but nothing helps.\nI said, “These things won’t help. You just go for two or three miles of jogging and jumping.” They said, “What? That will make us even more awake.”\nI said, “You don’t understand the dialectics of life: after three miles you will find it is difficult to reach back home; you will start feeling so sleepy and so tired. So don’t be worried: I will come with my car and I will pick you up; but I will pick you up only when I see that you are absolutely unable to reach home by walking. You will fall fast asleep anywhere on the street – in deep meditation.”\nYou are new here. Just it will take a little timebut soon you will find that every day meditation\nbecomes easier and easier. The energy just has to be exhausted. With so much energy, trying to meditate is just doing something which is impossible. So the clue is simple: allow this energy to have its dance – because when it is gone, then you will ask me, “Now, how to dance, how to sing?”\nSo while it is there, use it creatively. Meditation can wait a little. And here nobody will think you crazy, because there are far crazier people – you are just a beginner.\nI have heard: in one prison, a man entered a cell in which there was another man lying by the side of the wall, resting. This man asked, “How long are you going to be here?” The newcomer said, “I have been sentenced to fifteen years.”\nThe other said, “Then you remain near the door, because you will be getting out first. I have been sentenced to thirty years. So why take the trouble of coming too far inside? Just stay there, near the door. Fifteen years only?”\nYou are a newcomer, but you have come to the right place. Here, nobody will think you are crazy if you start jumping and dancing and singing on your own. Nobody is going to think that you are crazy – just a beginner – in the kindergarten.\nExhaust this energy; and then you will not ask how to meditate: you will find yourself flat on the ground and you will find meditation is happening.\nSometimes it has happened that people have thought that perhaps their hearts have stopped, or their breathing has stopped: the energy has been so exhausted that even to breathe or for the heart to beat, very little energy is left. Those are the moments when meditation is the easiest thing in the world. Always wait for the right time, for the right moment.\nQuestion 4 BELOVED OSHO,\nWHAT’S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN “LETTING GO,” “TRUSTING THAT EVERYTHING COMES BY ITSELF,” AND “GOING FOR IT,” OR “GOING WITH YOUR ENERGY”? MOST OF THE TIME I FIND MYSELF BETWEEN NOT ABLE TO TRUST AND UNABLE TO GO FOR IT. WHAT TO DO?\nAnand Virag... then remain in between. Don’t do anything. If you find yourself in the middle of these two polarities – one is “let go,” another is “go for it” – and you find yourself in between that is even better than either one of them. You have found the golden mean. Just remain there, don’t do anything; and all that has to happen to you will happen on its own accord.\nIt is a very rare question. People find it very easy either to go for it, with effort, with will, with power; or to let go, to surrender, trust and relax. But to find yourself in between is far better than both. There is no need to do anything; there is no need to choose between the two; just remain in between, silent, and watch whatsoever happens. Nature, or existence, or God – any name will do – will take care of you .\nIf you do something, then it will be forcing, repressing the other, and choosing one against the other. The repressed part will remain within you; and whatever you have chosen is only one half: and there will be moments when you will start thinking, perhaps I have chosen the wrong thing, perhaps the other one was right.\nSo whatever you choose, if it is only half, you will always repent, because half can never give you fulfillment. The other half will always go on pinching you, it will take revenge, it will not allow you so easily to choose its opposite. It depends on different people.\nFor you it is not a question of choice: you already understand that you are exactly in between. And you are asking me for my suggestion, what to choose. I am never in favor of choosing anything. Remain choiceless; and wherever you are, relax at that stage, at that step, at that space... and remain a watcher. The moment you choose you become a doer – and my whole effort is somehow to hammer it into your head that you are not to be a doer.\nTwo old ladies went to the zoo. They approached a very dangerous gorilla. As the zoo-attendant was opening the door of the cage, the gorilla reached out and pulled one of the old ladies inside and attacked her savagely. The alarm was raised, and the old lady was rescued. She was taken to the hospital, where she made a slow recovery. After several weeks, her friend was visiting her and consoling her, saying that it was time to forget her ordeal and start living again.\n“Ooohh,” wailed the old lady, “but he never writes, he never phones.”\nHalf-hearted... perhaps somebody has pulled her for the first time in her whole life. She must have been a Catholic nun.\nDo not choose. Let your life remain a freedom, without choice. A choiceless freedom and awareness is the very essence of all spiritual growth.\nQuestion 5 BELOVED OSHO,\nARE YOU HOLDING MY HAND OR PULLING MY LEG?\nDevaprem, if it is me, I must be pulling your leg. Holding your hand is not going to help – because you are not to be pulled out; you have to be completely drowned.\nThis place is not for stepping higher, this place is for going deeper. And to take you deeper, naturally, I have to pull your leg. You are trying in every possible way to hold on to something, but there is nothing to hold on to. I make sure that there is nothing around you to hold on to – and then I push you. Not even satisfied by that, I start pulling your leg.\nOne day you will be grateful for all the difficult tasks that I had to do for you. Question 6\nBELOVED OSHO,\nAT TIMES THE JOY, THE LOVE, THE SILENCE. AT OTHER TIMES IT SEEMS I’VE GOT A LUNATIC ASYLUM IN MY HEAD. OSHO, WHAT TO DO?\nSatgyana, become friendly with the lunatic in your head. I am against creating any antagonism in you, any kind of split, any schizophrenia.\nYou are saying, “At times the joy, the love, the silence. At other times it seems I have got a lunatic asylum in my head.” Everybody has got that lunatic asylum – that is our heritage. Your parents have given it to you, your priests have given it to you; your leaders, your teachers, your whole culture has given you only one thing as a heritage – and that is a lunatic asylum in your head.\nBut they are not responsible. The same has been done to them: every generation goes on giving all kinds of tensions and diseases, superstitions, madnesses, to the new generation. They don’t have anything else to give. But you are fortunate that a part of your mind feels joy sometimes, and love, and silence. These are such powerful and potent forces that you need not pay any attention to the lunatic asylum.\nRemember that paying attention is giving food. Ignore the lunatic asylum. Pour all the nourishment into your joy and into your love and into your silence. Don’t leave anything for all the lunatics that are living in your head. They will start deserting you; they will start entering into somebody else’s mind. There are always people who are very receptive; they are only receptive about lunatic things... so don’t be worried that they will die or starve. They will find their way.\nYou should simply ignore them. Let them be there, but behave as if they are not, and pour all your energy – without holding anything back – into joy, into love, into silence. So the lunatic part of your mind will start shrinking on its own accord, will die out.\nThis is the difference between western psychology and the eastern exploration of man’s interior being. Western psychology pays too much attention to the lunatic asylum – and that is giving food to it. You will not see Sigmund Freud talking about joy or love or silence or peace or blissfulness. In the whole literature of psychology you will not find these words even mentioned. They have their own vocabulary... schizophrenia, neurosis, psychosis.\nWhenever a psychoanalyst looks at you, he is looking for the lunatic; he is not looking for anything that is sane in you. He goes on bringing more and more up, digging more and more into the lunatic part of your mind. He makes you convinced that you are completely mad.\nThe eastern approach is so totally different, and so healthy, that you will not find neurosis, psychosis, schizophrenia, split personality... all these words and their complex definitions, explanations... and there is not much difference in them either – but they are making so much fuss about all these things.\nI have heard: somebody asked a great psychoanalyst, “What is the difference between psychosis and neurosis?” The great psychoanalyst said, “The difference is very subtle but very great. The psychotic thinks that two plus two are five; and the neurotic thinks two plus two are four but is uncomfortable about it.” The difference is very subtle, but they are making so much business out of it.\nThe East has emphasized the healthier part in you, the joyous part in you, the spiritual part in you. My own experience is that whatever you pay attention to, starts growing. Attention is nourishment; and whatever you ignore starts dying out.\nIn a small experiment one psychoanalyst was trying to find out whether giving someone attention or ignoring them made any difference. The eastern concept is that they make a tremendous difference. So he raised two small monkeys. Both were given sufficient food, medical care, everything that is necessary. But one was ignored: nobody even petted him, nobody hugged him, nobody touched his head with love – this was a deliberate experiment. The other monkey was given so much attention: whoever passed by would say “hello” to him, just pat his head or hug him.\nIt was a very surprising revelation to the psychoanalyst who was working on it, that the monkey who was not given any attention started shrinking, and the monkey who was given love, attention and friendliness, was growing perfectly well. The ignored monkey died within three months, and the other lived a full life. The experiment has been done many times in different labs, but the same is the result.\nAttention is invisible nourishment: when you look at somebody with love, with joy, with compassion, you are giving that person something which cannot be purchased, something which makes him feel needed, something which makes him feel worthy to exist. When the person is ignored, slowly, slowly the person starts feeling, “I am not needed; nobody even takes note of me. So why go on living?” He starts losing interest in being alive. And the moment you stop being interested in being alive, you cannot be alive for long, even if every physical necessity is fulfilled.\nBut there is some spiritual necessity. I call it the need to be needed. Somebody needs you and suddenly you feel a new upsurge of energy. The meditator starts feeling as if the whole of existence needs him: the trees need him, the mountains need him, the rivers need him. The ecstatic life of the\nmystic is based on this experience, that he is needed even by the faraway stars; that when the rose blossoms, it needs somebody to appreciate it.\nI had a gardener once, absolutely uneducated, illiterate. But he knew something that even great botanists are not aware. He was a poor man, but every year his flowers were winning the competition in the city. I asked him, “What is your secret?”\nHe was my gardener, so he was looking after my plants. He felt a little embarrassed and said, “It would have been better if you had not asked.” He was very shy.\nI said, “Don’t be worried, whatever it is, you just tell me.”\nFor years nobody has been able... and there were many competitors in the city, but that poor gardener was always coming first with his flowers. His roses were so big and so juicy, so red, so fragrant.… He said, “I am an uneducated man; I don’t know anything. All that I know is that I love my plants and, when there is nobody, I talk with them.”\nAnd he asked me, “Don’t tell anybody; people will think I am mad. I talk with the roses, I sit with them and I tell them, ‘You have to win the competition – this is a question of my whole prestige: for years I have been winning; don’t let me down.’ They have never failed me. They have always listened to me; and they always remembered that the competition has to be won for this poor old man, who loves them so much.”\nHe has never found in his whole life any garden where he was given total freedom. He was so happy with me that he was writing again and again, “... wherever you go, just call me there, I don’t ask anything, just food, even once a day will do, and I will grow your roses.”\nAnd it was not only roses, all kinds of beautiful flowers he grew. He had one plant which is I think does not exist in the West. It is called the “queen of the night”: it blossoms in the night, with very small flowers, but thousands of them. When they blossom you cannot see the leaves, only the flowers, just small white flowers.\nHis nightqueen was so fragrant that the neighbors even complained to me, “We cannot sleep because of the perfume. You have to remove this plant from here. The perfume is so strong that it keeps us awake. It is so beautiful, but we also need rest in the night.” I have seen thousands of nightqueens in different places, but I have never known that so much fragrance could come out of a single plant and disturb the whole neighborhood.\nI said, “That is not possible. You can move, you can go to hell, but that plant can not be removed, because my gardener does not treats the plants as plants, but as people. He has their names, he calls them by names.” Slowly, slowly my gardener became aware that I don’t think him crazy. So even in front of me, he will go on talking with his plants – working, watering, and talking.\nNow even scientist have come up with the discovery, that plants understand your feelings. They understand your joy, they understand your sadness too. And they understand your ignoring them. If this is true about plants, then mens mind is far more sensitive.\nSo just remember one thing, ignore the lunatic asylum that you have in your head. Everybody has it, so it is nothing special. Just keep your back towards it. And poor your whole energy in the joy and love and silence and peace, in compassion, into friendliness.\nYou will be surprised that when your whole energy is transformed into these positive qualities, the negative qualities start disappearing like darkness. One should never make the problem of negative qualities, that is the beginning of a wrong journey. If you have something that you feel should not be there, even this much is giving attention to it, that it should not be there.\nWhen I say, “Ignore!”, I am simply saying, “Behave as if it is not there – and pour your whole energy to the positive world, into all those beautiful values, which make you not only human beings, but can even help you to transcend humanity and become a Gautam Buddha.\nOkay Vimal, Yes Osho.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"5189","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_rebellious_spirit/part21/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_rebellious_spirit/>The Rebellious Spirit</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">21 Attention is invisible nourishment</h1><div class=post-meta>25 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;5189 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Rebellious_Spirit/part21.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part20>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

IN THOSE MOMENTS IT FEELS
AS IF WE ARE ALL SHARING A CUP OF DIVINE CHAMPAGNE, AND IN THIS
REJOICING WE LOSE OURSELVES AND COME CLOSE TO YOU. THANK YOU OSHO.</p><p><br></p><p>Prem Vishva, laughter has never been accepted by any religion of the
world as a spiritual quality. As far as I am concerned, it is one of the
most important spiritual qualities for the very simple reason that when
you are in total laughter your ego disappears. The laughter is: you are
not.</p><p><br></p><p>And if this is not being spiritual, then nothing else can be. It is
because of this that when you laugh together, you melt into each other,
and you melt with me.</p><p><br></p><p>Small egos disappear like dewdrops in the early morning sun.</p><p><br></p><p>The mind has never been able to laugh: it is basically serious; it is
basically pathological. The moment you laugh, suddenly you are not
functioning from the mind center anymore, you start functioning from the
heart center. And if the laughter is really total you can even go deeper
than the heart: you can reach to the very center of your being. It can
give you a glimpse of truth, of beauty, of the celebrating existence.
That’s why I love to see you laugh as much as possible.</p><p>And you are right: “In those moments it feels as if we are all
sharing a cup of divine champagne.” It is not “as if”... you are really
sharing a cup of divine champagne. “And in this rejoicing we lose
ourselves and come close to You” – not only close, you can become one
with me.</p><p><br></p><p>To be close is also to be distant; to be close is also to be
separate. Love is never fulfilled by just closeness; it is fulfilled
only when boundaries disappear, and merging and melting happens.</p><p><br></p><p>Prem Vishva, for you especially, I am telling this joke. A very
famous Zulu warrior went to the king of Zululand to ask for the hand of
the King’s daughter in marriage. The King said, “No man can marry my
daughter unless he can first carry out three tasks which I have
set.”</p><p><br></p><p>The warrior said, “Just tell them, O King, and I will do them
immediately.”</p><p><br></p><p>The king said, “I have set aside three tents. In the first tent is a
large barrel of alcohol: you must drink it all in one breath. You must
immediately go to the second tent, in which there is a seven-foot
gorilla who is crazy with toothache; you must find his bad tooth and
pull it out with your bare hands. In the third tent, which you must go
to immediately after, is an English lady who has been specially trained
not to have an orgasm. You must satisfy her totally!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, my King,” said the warrior. He went inside the first tent and
drank the full barrel of alcohol in one mighty effort. He staggered out
and went immediately into the next tent containing the mad gorilla.
There was a terrible fight, the tent shook and the air was rent with
screams and howling, large pieces of fur came flying out of the door,
and a human ear.</p><p><br></p><p>The roaring and shouting went on for twenty minutes. Then the
blood-soaked warrior crawled out, staggered to his feet, and said,
“Okay, your kingship, now show me where the English lady with the
toothache is.”</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>I FEEL HALF-COOKED! ON THE ONE HAND I’M HAPPY, MORE BLESSED AND
BLISSFUL, MORE LOVING AND LOVED THAN EVER BEFORE – AND I FEEL SO
THRILLED ABOUT IT. AND ON THE OTHER HAND MY OLD COMPANIONS – JEALOUSY,
COMPETITIVENESS, THE NEED TO BE IMPORTANT, SPECIAL – THEY ARE ALSO STILL
AROUND, IN THE SAME POT. I DANCE AND CELEBRATE WITH LIGHTNESS AND JOY,
AND WHEN THE FLASHES OF DARKNESS COME I RELAX AND ACCEPT AS MUCH AS I
CAN AND I TRY TO REMAIN WATCHFUL.</p><p><br></p><p>OSHO, SINCE SUPPOSEDLY I AM BOTH THE COOK AND THE COOKED, DO I NEED
TO TURN UP THE FIRE? OR WOULD YOU ADVISE THAT I CONTINUE TO SIMMER
SLOWLY? SOMEHOW, SIMMERING SLOWLY DOESN’T SEEM TO BE OUR WAY.…</p><p><br></p><p>Prem Arup, simmering slowly is certainly not our way. And you are
wrong about feeling that you are the cook and the cooked: I am the cook,
you are the cooked. So please leave it to me; you just get relaxed and
be cooked.</p><p>You say: “I feel half-cooked. On the one hand I am happy, more
blessed and blissful, more loving and loved than ever before – and I
feel so thrilled about it. And on the other hand my old companions –
jealousy, competitiveness, the need to be important, special – they are
also still around.”</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t be worried about them, don’t take them seriously. The more you
take them seriously, the more you nourish them. Let them be around: just
be playful with them. Your blissfulness, your being more loved and more
loving will take care of the whole thing.</p><p><br></p><p>Qualities like jealousy exist only when you are not loved, when you
are not capable of loving. Competitiveness, the need to be important,
special, they are all part of the same phenomenon: jealousy. They are
not separate things, separate aspects. And if you are feeling blissful,
happy, loved and loving, then there is no need to be worried: if you
have light, the darkness will disappear on its own.</p><p><br></p><p>They are your old companions, so just out of habit they still come to
see you. Be courteous; don’t be angry about them, and don’t try to push
them away. Just watch – but watch joyously. Your watchfulness can also
become serious, and that is a great problem: it should remain part of
your playfulness... and jealousy cannot exist.</p><p><br></p><p>And when you are blissful, who cares about being important? – you are
important. And when you are loved and you are loving, who bothers about
being special? These desires arise in people who don’t have any taste of
bliss, any taste of love.</p><p><br></p><p>It is true you are half-cooked – because these things are still
coming; but even being half-cooked is a great phenomenon. The rest will
also happen. And that is not your responsibility: I am the cook here,
and I have cooked so many people that you can trust me, Arup.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 3 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>LOOKING BACK AT THIS PAST YEAR-AND-A-HALF SINCE I MET YOU, IT SEEMS
THAT I AM FLYING OUT OF CONTROL.</p><p><br></p><p>PEOPLE THINK I AM CRAZY, BUT I LAUGH AS I TEAR AWAY THE PIECES OF MY
OLD LIFE. AND YOU’VE TOLD ME, THAT WAS JUST FOR STARTERS. MY MEDITATIONS
ARE DIFFICULT... I AM SO EXCITED AND HIGH MOST OF THE TIME.</p><p><br></p><p>MAYBE YOU WILL GIVE ME SOME CLUE TO QUIET THIS BOUNCING HEART.</p><p><br></p><p>BELOVED MASTER, I’VE COME THIS FAR AND GIVEN UP THIS MUCH TO BE HERE
NOW, TO TAKE SANNYAS AND SURRENDER – WHAT NOW?</p><p><br></p><p>Rich Frank, now you can retire. You have done the last thing –
surrender. Now you are no longer there. Now it is my concern – you are
completely free, because beyond surrender, there is nothing to be
done.</p><p>Surrender means that you have dropped the ego; and now “You are
flying out of control.” It feels out of control because you have
remained always in control. Now drop that control; now you are no longer
the pilot; you have surrendered. And the sky is vast – there is no fear
of your falling out of the sky.</p><p>You say that people think you are crazy. You are! I attract only
crazy people. The so-called saints remain always at a distance.</p><p>When I was a student at the university one of my professors told me
that it would be a great act of compassion towards him if I didn’t come
into his class: “As far as your attendance record is concerned, I will
give you one hundred percent.”</p><p>I said, “But what is the matter? I have joined the class, I have paid
the fee for it.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “You can take the fee from me, but just the idea of having
you for two years in the class drives me crazy. The moment I see you,
something in me starts trembling.” And he was a very sane person, but
people’s sanity is superficial: just a little scratch and they will go
insane.</p><p>I don’t want you to be superficially sane: I want you to drop all
superficial sanity. Everybody will think you are crazy, but you are
simply being natural; and nature is not crazy. To be natural is the
authentic sanity: the more natural you become, the bigger will become
the distance with the artificial society and the artificial people – but
you will be becoming more and more sane.</p><p>When you reach to the very core of your being, you have attained the
final sanity; but in the eyes of other people you will look absolutely
mad. People have created their own game of sanity, and if you break
their rules, immediately they condemn you as crazy. I am not here to
condemn you, but to transform you. Your craziness is the beginning of
your authentic sanity.</p><p>Don’t be worried about what people say; remember only how you feel
yourself. If you are feeling joyous, drunk with blissfulness, there is
no need for any control. Control is dangerous, because control means you
are not allowing your nature its flow. Control means you are cutting
off... trying to force yourself to be a certain way, the way others
expect you to be. People give respectability and honor to those who are
following the rules of their game; they will not give you
respectability, and they will not give you honor. But to be crazy and
natural is so valuable that these bogus values of honor, respectability,
reputation, don’t have any meaning.</p><p>You cannot fly out of control; it is simply not possible. It is just
that you have always remained in control, so just relaxing a little you
become afraid.</p><p>It happened in the religious class of a small school: the teacher was
telling the students to draw, according to them, the concept of God. She
had been explaining to them the Christian concept of God.</p><p>The bishop had come to see how things are going in the class, and she
wanted to show something from the small boys and girls.</p><p>They had all drawn pictures, and one small boy had drawn a picture of
an airplane with four windows. Even the bishop was struck: what kind of
an idea of God does he have? And from every window something looking
like a man...?</p><p>The teacher said, “What is this? This is your idea of God?”</p><p><br></p><p>The boy said, “You have told us that God is a trinity: the first is
God the Father – you can see... with the beard of ancient old age. In
the second window is the son – you can even see the cross – Jesus
Christ. In the third you don’t see any face because it is the holy ghost
– just something like a whirlwind.”</p><p><br></p><p>The bishop and the teacher together asked him, “What about the
fourth? From where has the fourth come?”</p><p><br></p><p>The little boy said, “The fourth?... Pontius the pilot. Without him
the airplane will go out of control.”</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t be worried; nature itself takes care of you. You relax... and
that is the meaning of surrender: that you relax and you allow nature to
take you wherever it wants to take you. You don’t have any plan, you
don’t have any guidebook, you don’t have a certain goal, you don’t have
any desire to reach somewhere; wherever nature takes you will be your
home, will be your destiny.</p><p><br></p><p>You are also worried that “my meditations are difficult... I am so
excited and high most of the time. Maybe You will give some clue to
quiet this bouncing heart.” There is no clue; let it bounce as much as
it can. And you are excited and high most of the time: enjoy it. Nobody
can remain forever excited and high – and the more you are excited and
high, the sooner you will be relaxed.</p><p><br></p><p>And right now – when you are so excited and high, with a bouncing
heart – if you try to meditate, you are just trying something which is
against your nature at this moment. Forget meditation for the moment.
Meditation will come; first get tired.</p><p><br></p><p>When you are calm, you will see that meditation is happening. The
heart is bouncing no more; you are not flying high; you are no longer
excited; flat on the earth... and meditation begins. But first, let this
whole energy be exhausted.</p><p><br></p><p>I once lived with a friend for a few days. He had a small son so full
of energy, that it was impossible to talk. He was jumping into
everything, throwing things, putting on the radio. My friend said: “What
to do with this boy? He is so full of energy<span class=s4></span>”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Don’t be worried.” I told the boy, “You just go around the
house as many times as you can. Then you can ask for any reward, and I
will give it to you.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Promise?”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Promise.” He could go only seven times around the house and
then he was flat on the ground. I said, “What are you doing?”</p><p>He said, “Finished!”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “What about your reward?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “I will think later on. Right now, don’t disturb me.”</p><p>His father said, “Strange... I have been telling him continually, not
to disturb me! It is the first time he has said ‘don’t disturb me!’”</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “He has gone into meditation!”</p><p><br></p><p>You will also go into meditation. Everybody who is here is going to
go into meditation, but first, jog and jump as high as you can; let your
heart bounce... and don’t be worried: when the energy is moving high,
you cannot relax.</p><p><br></p><p>Many people asked me about the fact that they cannot sleep – and they
have tried all kinds of methods: mantras, chanting, listening to music,
but nothing helps.</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “These things won’t help. You just go for two or three miles
of jogging and jumping.” They said, “What? That will make us even more
awake.”</p><p>I said, “You don’t understand the dialectics of life: after three
miles you will find it is difficult to reach back home; you will start
feeling so sleepy and so tired. So don’t be worried: I will come with my
car and I will pick you up; but I will pick you up only when I see that
you are absolutely unable to reach home by walking. You will fall fast
asleep anywhere on the street – in deep meditation.”</p><p><br></p><p>You are new here. Just it will take a little time<span class=s4></span>but soon you will find that every day meditation</p><p>becomes easier and easier. The energy just has to be exhausted. With
so much energy, trying to meditate is just doing something which is
impossible. So the clue is simple: allow this energy to have its dance –
because when it is gone, then you will ask me, “Now, how to dance, how
to sing?”</p><p><br></p><p>So while it is there, use it creatively. Meditation can wait a
little. And here nobody will think you crazy, because there are far
crazier people – you are just a beginner.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard: in one prison, a man entered a cell in which there was
another man lying by the side of the wall, resting. This man asked, “How
long are you going to be here?” The newcomer said, “I have been
sentenced to fifteen years.”</p><p><br></p><p>The other said, “Then you remain near the door, because you will be
getting out first. I have been sentenced to thirty years. So why take
the trouble of coming too far inside? Just stay there, near the door.
Fifteen years only<span class=s4></span>?”</p><p><br></p><p>You are a newcomer, but you have come to the right place. Here,
nobody will think you are crazy if you start jumping and dancing and
singing on your own. Nobody is going to think that you are crazy – just
a beginner – in the kindergarten.</p><p><br></p><p>Exhaust this energy; and then you will not ask how to meditate: you
will find yourself flat on the ground and you will find meditation is
happening.</p><p><br></p><p>Sometimes it has happened that people have thought that perhaps their
hearts have stopped, or their breathing has stopped: the energy has been
so exhausted that even to breathe or for the heart to beat, very little
energy is left. Those are the moments when meditation is the easiest
thing in the world. Always wait for the right time, for the right
moment.</p><p>Question 4 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>WHAT’S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN “LETTING GO,” “TRUSTING THAT EVERYTHING
COMES BY ITSELF,” AND “GOING FOR IT,” OR “GOING WITH YOUR ENERGY”? MOST
OF THE TIME I FIND MYSELF BETWEEN NOT ABLE TO TRUST AND UNABLE TO GO FOR
IT. WHAT TO DO?</p><p><br></p><p>Anand Virag... then remain in between. Don’t do anything. If you find
yourself in the middle of these two polarities – one is “let go,”
another is “go for it” – and you find yourself in between that is even
better than either one of them. You have found the golden mean. Just
remain there, don’t do anything; and all that has to happen to you will
happen on its own accord.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a very rare question. People find it very easy either to go for
it, with effort, with will, with power; or to let go, to surrender,
trust and relax. But to find yourself in between is far better than
both. There is no need to do anything; there is no need to choose
between the two; just remain in between, silent, and watch whatsoever
happens. Nature, or existence, or God – any name will do – will take
care of you .</p><p><br></p><p>If you do something, then it will be forcing, repressing the other,
and choosing one against the other. The repressed part will remain
within you; and whatever you have chosen is only one half: and there
will be moments when you will start thinking, perhaps I have chosen the
wrong thing, perhaps the other one was right.</p><p><br></p><p>So whatever you choose, if it is only half, you will always repent,
because half can never give you fulfillment. The other half will always
go on pinching you, it will take revenge, it will not allow you so
easily to choose its opposite. It depends on different people.</p><p><br></p><p>For you it is not a question of choice: you already understand that
you are exactly in between. And you are asking me for my suggestion,
what to choose. I am never in favor of choosing anything. Remain
choiceless; and wherever you are, relax at that stage, at that step, at
that space... and remain a watcher. The moment you choose you become a
doer – and my whole effort is somehow to hammer it into your head that
you are not to be a doer.</p><p><br></p><p>Two old ladies went to the zoo. They approached a very dangerous
gorilla. As the zoo-attendant was opening the door of the cage, the
gorilla reached out and pulled one of the old ladies inside and attacked
her savagely. The alarm was raised, and the old lady was rescued. She
was taken to the hospital, where she made a slow recovery. After several
weeks, her friend was visiting her and consoling her, saying that it was
time to forget her ordeal and start living again.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ooohh,” wailed the old lady, “but he never writes, he never
phones.”</p><p><br></p><p>Half-hearted... perhaps somebody has pulled her for the first time in
her whole life. She must have been a Catholic nun.</p><p><br></p><p>Do not choose. Let your life remain a freedom, without choice. A
choiceless freedom and awareness is the very essence of all spiritual
growth.</p><p>Question 5 BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>ARE YOU HOLDING MY HAND OR PULLING MY LEG?</p><p><br></p><p>Devaprem, if it is me, I must be pulling your leg. Holding your hand
is not going to help – because you are not to be pulled out; you have to
be completely drowned.</p><p><br></p><p>This place is not for stepping higher, this place is for going
deeper. And to take you deeper, naturally, I have to pull your leg. You
are trying in every possible way to hold on to something, but there is
nothing to hold on to. I make sure that there is nothing around you to
hold on to – and then I push you. Not even satisfied by that, I start
pulling your leg.</p><p><br></p><p>One day you will be grateful for all the difficult tasks that I had
to do for you. Question 6</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>AT TIMES THE JOY, THE LOVE, THE SILENCE. AT OTHER TIMES IT SEEMS I’VE
GOT A LUNATIC ASYLUM IN MY HEAD. OSHO, WHAT TO DO?</p><p><br></p><p>Satgyana, become friendly with the lunatic in your head. I am against
creating any antagonism in you, any kind of split, any
schizophrenia.</p><p><br></p><p>You are saying, “At times the joy, the love, the silence. At other
times it seems I have got a lunatic asylum in my head.” Everybody has
got that lunatic asylum – that is our heritage. Your parents have given
it to you, your priests have given it to you; your leaders, your
teachers, your whole culture has given you only one thing as a heritage
– and that is a lunatic asylum in your head.</p><p><br></p><p>But they are not responsible. The same has been done to them: every
generation goes on giving all kinds of tensions and diseases,
superstitions, madnesses, to the new generation. They don’t have
anything else to give. But you are fortunate that a part of your mind
feels joy sometimes, and love, and silence. These are such powerful and
potent forces that you need not pay any attention to the lunatic
asylum.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember that paying attention is giving food. Ignore the lunatic
asylum. Pour all the nourishment into your joy and into your love and
into your silence. Don’t leave anything for all the lunatics that are
living in your head. They will start deserting you; they will start
entering into somebody else’s mind. There are always people who are very
receptive; they are only receptive about lunatic things... so don’t be
worried that they will die or starve. They will find their way.</p><p><br></p><p>You should simply ignore them. Let them be there, but behave as if
they are not, and pour all your energy – without holding anything back –
into joy, into love, into silence. So the lunatic part of your mind will
start shrinking on its own accord, will die out.</p><p>This is the difference between western psychology and the eastern
exploration of man’s interior being. Western psychology pays too much
attention to the lunatic asylum – and that is giving food to it. You
will not see Sigmund Freud talking about joy or love or silence or peace
or blissfulness. In the whole literature of psychology you will not find
these words even mentioned. They have their own vocabulary...
schizophrenia, neurosis, psychosis.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever a psychoanalyst looks at you, he is looking for the lunatic;
he is not looking for anything that is sane in you. He goes on bringing
more and more up, digging more and more into the lunatic part of your
mind. He makes you convinced that you are completely mad.</p><p><br></p><p>The eastern approach is so totally different, and so healthy, that
you will not find neurosis, psychosis, schizophrenia, split
personality... all these words and their complex definitions,
explanations... and there is not much difference in them either – but
they are making so much fuss about all these things.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard: somebody asked a great psychoanalyst, “What is the
difference between psychosis and neurosis?” The great psychoanalyst
said, “The difference is very subtle but very great. The psychotic
thinks that two plus two are five; and the neurotic thinks two plus two
are four but is uncomfortable about it.” The difference is very subtle,
but they are making so much business out of it.</p><p><br></p><p>The East has emphasized the healthier part in you, the joyous part in
you, the spiritual part in you. My own experience is that whatever you
pay attention to, starts growing. Attention is nourishment; and whatever
you ignore starts dying out.</p><p><br></p><p>In a small experiment one psychoanalyst was trying to find out
whether giving someone attention or ignoring them made any difference.
The eastern concept is that they make a tremendous difference. So he
raised two small monkeys. Both were given sufficient food, medical care,
everything that is necessary. But one was ignored: nobody even petted
him, nobody hugged him, nobody touched his head with love – this was a
deliberate experiment. The other monkey was given so much attention:
whoever passed by would say “hello” to him, just pat his head or hug
him.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a very surprising revelation to the psychoanalyst who was
working on it, that the monkey who was not given any attention started
shrinking, and the monkey who was given love, attention and
friendliness, was growing perfectly well. The ignored monkey died within
three months, and the other lived a full life. The experiment has been
done many times in different labs, but the same is the result.</p><p><br></p><p>Attention is invisible nourishment: when you look at somebody with
love, with joy, with compassion, you are giving that person something
which cannot be purchased, something which makes him feel needed,
something which makes him feel worthy to exist. When the person is
ignored, slowly, slowly the person starts feeling, “I am not needed;
nobody even takes note of me. So why go on living?” He starts losing
interest in being alive. And the moment you stop being interested in
being alive, you cannot be alive for long, even if every physical
necessity is fulfilled.</p><p><br></p><p>But there is some spiritual necessity. I call it the need to be
needed. Somebody needs you and suddenly you feel a new upsurge of
energy. The meditator starts feeling as if the whole of existence needs
him: the trees need him, the mountains need him, the rivers need him.
The ecstatic life of the</p><p>mystic is based on this experience, that he is needed even by the
faraway stars; that when the rose blossoms, it needs somebody to
appreciate it.</p><p><br></p><p>I had a gardener once, absolutely uneducated, illiterate. But he knew
something that even great botanists are not aware. He was a poor man,
but every year his flowers were winning the competition in the city. I
asked him, “What is your secret?”</p><p><br></p><p>He was my gardener, so he was looking after my plants. He felt a
little embarrassed and said, “It would have been better if you had not
asked.” He was very shy.</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “Don’t be worried, whatever it is, you just tell me.”</p><p><br></p><p>For years nobody has been able... and there were many competitors in
the city, but that poor gardener was always coming first with his
flowers. His roses were so big and so juicy, so red, so fragrant.… He
said, “I am an uneducated man; I don’t know anything. All that I know is
that I love my plants and, when there is nobody, I talk with them.”</p><p><br></p><p>And he asked me, “Don’t tell anybody; people will think I am mad. I
talk with the roses, I sit with them and I tell them, ‘You have to win
the competition – this is a question of my whole prestige: for years I
have been winning; don’t let me down.’ They have never failed me. They
have always listened to me; and they always remembered that the
competition has to be won for this poor old man, who loves them so
much.”</p><p><br></p><p>He has never found in his whole life any garden where he was given
total freedom. He was so happy with me that he was writing again and
again, “... wherever you go, just call me there, I don’t ask anything,
just food, even once a day will do, and I will grow your roses.”</p><p><br></p><p>And it was not only roses, all kinds of beautiful flowers he grew. He
had one plant which is I think does not exist in the West. It is called
the “queen of the night”: it blossoms in the night, with very small
flowers, but thousands of them. When they blossom you cannot see the
leaves, only the flowers, just small white flowers.</p><p><br></p><p>His nightqueen was so fragrant that the neighbors even complained to
me, “We cannot sleep because of the perfume. You have to remove this
plant from here. The perfume is so strong that it keeps us awake. It is
so beautiful, but we also need rest in the night.” I have seen thousands
of nightqueens in different places, but I have never known that so much
fragrance could come out of a single plant and disturb the whole
neighborhood.</p><p><br></p><p>I said, “That is not possible. You can move, you can go to hell, but
that plant can not be removed, because my gardener does not treats the
plants as plants, but as people. He has their names, he calls them by
names.” Slowly, slowly my gardener became aware that I don’t think him
crazy. So even in front of me, he will go on talking with his plants –
working, watering, and talking.</p><p><br></p><p>Now even scientist have come up with the discovery, that plants
understand your feelings. They understand your joy, they understand your
sadness too. And they understand your ignoring them. If this is true
about plants, then mens mind is far more sensitive.</p><p>So just remember one thing, ignore the lunatic asylum that you have
in your head. Everybody has it, so it is nothing special. Just keep your
back towards it. And poor your whole energy in the joy and love and
silence and peace, in compassion, into friendliness.</p><p><br></p><p>You will be surprised that when your whole energy is transformed into
these positive qualities, the negative qualities start disappearing like
darkness. One should never make the problem of negative qualities, that
is the beginning of a wrong journey. If you have something that you feel
should not be there, even this much is giving attention to it, that it
should not be there.</p><p><br></p><p>When I say, “Ignore!”, I am simply saying, “Behave as if it is not
there – and pour your whole energy to the positive world, into all those
beautiful values, which make you not only human beings, but can even
help you to transcend humanity and become a Gautam Buddha.</p><p><br></p><p>Okay Vimal, Yes Osho.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part20>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

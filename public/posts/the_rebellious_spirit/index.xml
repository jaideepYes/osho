‌CHAPTER 1
Meditation is the greatest charity
10 February 1987 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
IN YOUR VISION, IS CHARITY A PART OF RELIGIOUSNESS? IF SO, WHAT WOULD CONSTITUTE CHARITY? FOLLOWING THE CATHOLIC CONCEPT, THE INDIAN LEGISLATURE SPECIFIES: 1) RELIEF FOR THE POOR, 2) EDUCATION, AND 3) MEDICAL RELIEF, AS BEING CHARITY.
WHAT IS THE CONCEPT OF CHARITY IN THE EYES OF A BUDDHA?</description>

‌CHAPTER 10
Freedom opens the door of responsibility
15 February 1987 am in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WAITING FOR THE SHIP TO COME IN, AND BEING PASSIVE AND FATALISTIC?
Satyam Svarup, the difference between waiting for the ship to come, and being passive and fatalistic is immense, although very delicate.
The fatalistic mind does not believe in the individual’s own freedom, does not believe in the individual’s own longing and search.</description>

‌CHAPTER 11
Rebellion is a style of life
15 February 1987 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
WHAT IS YOUR NOTION OF REBELLION AND OF A REBEL?
Giulia, my notion about the rebel and rebellion is very simple: a man who does not live like a robot conditioned by the past.
Religion, society, culture... anything that is of yesterday does not in any way interfere in his way of life, in his style of life.</description>

‌CHAPTER 12
All buddhas are gamblers
16 February 1987 am in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
WHY, WHEN TRUTH AND LIES MEET, DOES TROUBLE ARISE?
Waduda, man almost lives in lies, because they are comfortable, convenient. You don’t have to make much effort to find a lie. The whole of society is ready to give you all kinds of lies – but truth is an individual search.</description>

‌CHAPTER 13
God is the ocean you are in
16 February 1987 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
WHEN YOU SAY THAT YOU WANT US TO RAISE THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE WORLD, IT PUZZLES ME. I FEEL I NEED ALL MY ENERGY TO GET MY OWN FEET OFF THE GROUND. AND I AM IN A WAY TOTALLY FORGETTING “THAT WORLD,” AND GLAD TO BE ABLE TO LET GO AND DISAPPEAR IN THIS BUDDHAFIELD OF DRUNKEN BLISS, DANCE AND SILENCE.</description>

‌CHAPTER 14
The golden key
17 February 1987 am in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
FOR QUITE SOME TIME NOW I HAVE BEEN LOOKING INTO WHY AND HOW I PROTECT MYSELF, AND WHO I’M PROTECTING MYSELF FROM. I FIND IT EXPRESSES ITSELF THROUGH ARROGANCE, AND THE SAFETY OF ONLY WANTING TO STAY ON THE SIDE OF THE GIVER. I FEEL LIKE A ROCKET WHICH IS ALL PREPARED TO BE LAUNCHED: ALL THE SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN CLEARED BUT ONE LOCK IS STILL ON – THE LOCK OF PROTECTION.</description>

God the father – just another teddy bear
17 February 1987 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
WHEN MY FATHER DIED TEN YEARS AGO, HE WAS MY LAST REASON FOR LIVING. AFTER THIS STRONG EXPERIENCE, I HAVE FELT MORE ALONE EVERY DAY. WHEN I MET YOU IT WAS LIKE MEETING MY FATHER AGAIN. BUT NOW, WITH YOU, I FEEL MORE AND MORE ALONE.</description>

‌CHAPTER 16
The present is the only time you have
18 February 1987 am in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
IS IT POSSIBLE TO DIE CONSCIOUSLY WITHOUT BEING ENLIGHTENED?
Nirah, existence follows certain laws – and there are no exceptions. If one wants to die consciously, the only way is to be enlightened.
Death is such a great surgery: your soul is being taken apart from the body and mind, with which it has been involved for seventy or eighty years.</description>

18 February 1987 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
WOULD YOU PLEASE TALK ABOUT PLAYFULNESS? I ASK BECAUSE THERE IS A BEAUTIFUL SMALL BOY WITHIN ME WHOM I HAVE NEGLECTED FOR A LONG TIME. THIS SMALL BOY IS PLAYFUL, CURIOUS AND ECSTATIC – BUT MOST OF THE TIME I DO NOT ALLOW HIM TO LOSE CONTROL.</description>

19 February 1987 am in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
WHEN I LOOK AT THE MOMENTS WHEN I FEEL SEPARATE FROM YOU, FROM MY LOVE AND THE REST OF EXISTENCE, IT IS USUALLY THE SHADOWS OF COMPARISON AND JEALOUSY; AND WHEN I GO DEEPER I USUALLY GET IN TOUCH WITH A DEEP INSECURITY AND THE FEELING OF BEING INFERIOR.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
I FEEL IN MY ELEMENT WHEN EXTROVERTED AND IN ACTION. WHEN I AM QUIET, AND THIS BUSY BUMBLE BEE DOESN’T FEEL SHE HAS TO BE BUZZING, IT IS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE. IS THE “DOER” IN ME DYING? WILL IT EVER BE ABLE TO RELAX IN ACTION AND SILENCE?</description>

20 February 1987 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
WHY DO YOU LIKE TO MAKE US LAUGH SO MUCH? IN THOSE MOMENTS IT FEELS AS IF WE ARE ALL SHARING A CUP OF DIVINE CHAMPAGNE, AND IN THIS REJOICING WE LOSE OURSELVES AND COME CLOSE TO YOU. THANK YOU OSHO.
Prem Vishva, laughter has never been accepted by any religion of the world as a spiritual quality.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
MOVING INTO ALONENESS, INTO SUCH SILENCE, PEACE AND BLISS, I SUDDENLY REALIZED THAT AT THE SAME TIME I WAS COMING CLOSER AND CLOSER TO YOU. DANCING WITH YOUR LOVE, NEVER BEFORE HAVE I BEEN IN SUCH A SPACE – COMING HOME AT LAST. BUT I HAVE TO GO SOON, AND I AM SO AFRAID TO LOSE IT.</description>

Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
PALTUDAS SAYS, “EVERY ART TAKES PLACE IN ITS OWN TIME, SO WHY GET IMPATIENT? NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU WATER IT, THE TREE COMES INTO FRUITION IN ITS OWN TIME.”

‌CHAPTER 9
I am a river continuously flowing
14 February 1987 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium
Question 1 BELOVED OSHO,
TWENTY-FIVE YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE WE SAW YOU, KNEW YOU, AND DISSOLVED IN YOU. THERE HAVE BEEN OTHERS ALSO. THERE HAS BEEN NO “TURNING BACK” EITHER, IN OUR THOUGHTS. WE HAVE SEEN MANY PEOPLE MAKING SUDDEN TURNABOUTS, EVEN AFTER REACHING TO HEIGHTS – EVEN AJIT SARASWATI.</description>

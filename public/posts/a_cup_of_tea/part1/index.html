What a drama!\nBut perhaps all of life is a drama\nand becoming aware of this opens the door to a unique freedom.\nThat which is inaction in action stillness in motion eternity in change – that is truth\nand that is existence.\nReal life lies in this eternity –\neverything else is just the stream of dreams.\nIn truth the world is just a dream\nand the question is not whether to leave these dreams or not,\none just has to be aware of them.\nWith this awareness, everything changes. The centre moves.\nA shift takes place from body to soul. And what is THERE?\nIt cannot be told.\nIt has never been told\nand it never will be!\nThere is no other way but to know it for oneself.\nDeath is known only through dying\nand truth is known only through diving deep within oneself.\nMay God drown you in this truth! 2\nLove.\nI am in bliss.\nI have been meaning to write for a long time but many engagements prevented me.\nMy blessings, however, I send every day. Life is a sadhana;\nthe more you involve yourself in it the more divine it becomes.\nThe light is hidden in the darkness, truth is hidden,\nand from THIS comes the joy of searching. I remember the words of a rishi:\nTRUTH IS HIDDEN UNDER A GOLDEN LID.\nThe golden lid that hides truth is nothing but our mind.\nThe mind has smothered us; we are in it,\nwe identify with it,\ntherefore the suffering comes,\nthe bondage and the chain of rebirths. Rise above it,\nbecome aware that you are distinct from it – that alone brings bliss,\nthat alone is freedom\nand the end of birth and death. We have to be what we truly are:\nthis is the only sadhana.\nIt is the frustration of living through desires that brings this sadhana.\nBecome alert about desire\nand non-attachment begins to appear. This is not to be made to happen,\nit follows naturally from awareness of attachment.\nEach one of us has to become aware of his attachments, and keep being so!\nNothing should be done unconsciously.\nIf this is remembered\none day a totally new kind of revolution takes place in our consciousness.\nGod is leading you towards this revolution – this I know.\n3\nMy respects to you.\nI was extremely pleased to get your letter.\nSo far I have not written anything\nbut a meditation centre has started here where some friends are experimenting.\nWhen I have some definite results\nthere is every possibility of my writing something.\nAbout my experiments on myself, I am sure and certain, but I want to test their usefulness to others.\nI do not want to write anything in the manner of philosophy, my outlook is scientific.\nI want to say something about yoga based on certain psychological\nand para-psychological experiments.\nThere are many illusory notions held about it and these have to be refuted.\nTherefore I am experimenting here also.\nIt is clear to me\nthat this work is not for promoting any group or cause. If you ever come here we can talk more about all this. 4\nMy respects to you.\nI am grateful for your affectionate letter.\nYou are meditating – that is a matter for joy. Drop all ideas of achieving in meditation, just do it naturally;\nwhat happens, happens on its own.\nOne day, effortlessly, everything starts happening by itself.\nEffort does not lead to meditation, in fact it is a hindrance.\nIn effort, practice, study, there is tension.\nAny expectation,\neven the expectation of peace, brings restlessness.\nThe tension has to go. As soon as this happens a divine peace sets in.\nStop feeling: I AM DOING IT;\nrealize instead: I LEAVE MYSELF IN THE HANDS OF THAT-WHICH-IS.\nSurrender,\nsurrender yourself completely;\nas soon as you do this, emptiness comes. Breathing and the body are becoming relaxed, you say.\nThis will happen with the mind too.\nWhen the mind goes\nwhat takes place is indescribable.\nI know that this is going to happen to you both. Just go on naturally and without purpose.\nSoon I shall be there,\nuntil then, go on quietly with what I have told you to do.\nMy respects to all.\nWrite whenever you feel like it. I am in complete bliss.\n5\nLove.\nIt is through God’s grace\nthat you are working towards the discovery of the inner light.\nThat light is definitely there\nand once it is met all darkness in life disappears.\nEach step taken within\npeels away the darkness layer by layer unfolding a world of light in which everything is new.\nThis experience cuts away all bondage –\nand then comes the realization that it was never there!\nLiberation happens to that which is eternally free! I am pleased with your progress.\nYour letter was received long back\nbut as I was busy there was delay in replying, but my memory of you is always there,\nalong with all those eager for the light.\nMy good wishes flow for ever towards them. We have to keep going.\nMany times one becomes disheartened on the path but ultimately the thirsty pilgrim reaches the\nspring.\nIn fact the water is there before the thirst. My kind regards to all.\n6\nMy respects to you.\nI was away, but your letter followed me here. I am pleased to have it.\nI see life as full of bliss.\nOrdinarily, we do not have the eyes to see this and so are deprived of it,\nbut this seeing can be created.\nPerhaps it is not correct to say it can be created; it is already there,\nit is only a matter of opening the eyes,\nand then – everything changes. Meditation achieves this.\nMeditation means: peace; emptiness.\nThis emptiness is there but is concealed by the flow of thoughts.\nAs thoughts cease it comes into view.\nIt seems difficult to become free of thoughts but it is very simple.\nThe mind seems very restless but it can easily settle.\nThe key to this transcendence is witnessing. One has to be a witness,\nan observer of the mind. One has to watch it,\njust watch it.\nThe moment the witness state dawns,\nthat very moment one becomes free of thoughts.\nThis in turn opens the door to bliss\nand then this very world changes into a new world altogether.\nKeep meditating.\nResults will come slowly.\nYou are not to worry about that, their coming is certain.\nMy kind regards to all.\n7\nLove.\nIt is a long time since I received your letter. I am happy that you long for peace –\nbut drop this idea that you are way behind. Nobody is lagging behind.\nIt is just a matter of turning in – and the drop becomes the ocean. Actually the drop IS the ocean but it does not know it –\nthat is the only separation.\nIn the emptiness of meditation even this separation goes.\nMeditation is the centre of life’s sadhana.\nThe thought process will slow down\nand in its place will come peace and emptiness.\nWhen thoughts vanish\nthe seer, the witness, becomes visible\nand the complex of the unconscious disappears. This complex is the cause of bondage.\nIn the beginning it appears as hard as stone but the seeker who practises patiently\nfinds one day that it was just a dream,\na puff of air.\nMay the seed of your meditation blossom into the flower of SAMADHI! My kind regards to all.\nThe rest when we meet.\n8\nMy respects to you.\nMoving around for the whole of May affected my health so all programmes for June: Bombay, Calcutta, Jaipur, were cancelled.\nI am glad to hear you are experimenting with SAMADHI YOGA.\nDon’t worry about results, just be with the experimenting.\nThe return is bound to come one day – not gradually but all of a sudden, effortlessly, without\none’s knowing, it happens. Within a moment life becomes wonderfully different!\nI am not writing anything on Bhagwan Mahavir at the moment. There is no urge whatsoever in me to write. But if you persuade me it is a different thing! Everything\nelse is fine. 9\nLove\nI read your letter on the way here. It has touched my heart.\nIf your desire to know life’s truth becomes strong then what is longing today\nbecomes one day the attainment. Burning desire is all that is needed and nothing else.\nAs rivers seek out the ocean\nso man if he wants to can find the truth. No peak, no mountain can stop him,\nin fact their challenge awakens his sense of adventure.\nTruth is within everyone. Rivers have to find the ocean but our ocean is inside us –\nit is a wonder that so many remain thirsty yet without it.\nActually they cannot really want it.\nThere is a saying of Christ’s: Ask and ye shall be given.\nBut if you don’t ask, whose fault is it?\nThere is no better bargain than the attainment of God.\nWe have only to ask, nothing more.\nAs the asking grows stronger and stronger so he who asks starts vanishing.\nA limit is reached,\na point of evaporation is reached, where the seeker utterly disappears and only the asking remains.\nThis is the very moment of attainment. Truth is where the I is not –\nthis experience alone is the divine experience. Absence of ego is presence of God.\nMy regards to all there. 10\nMy respects to you.\nI was waiting for your letter when it came. I really want your life to be filled with light, for you to surrender yourself to God.\nGod and light are always close by.\nit is only a matter of opening one’s eyes and then what is ours becomes ours.\nThe distance is just that between the eyelash and the eye –\nand perhaps not even that much;\nthe eyes are always open only we don’t know it. There is an old story:\nA fish had long heard stories about the ocean.\nShe began to fret about it\nso one day she asked the Queen of Fishes: What is this ocean and where is it?\nThe Queen was surprised. She said:\nThe ocean? Why, you are in the very ocean itself! Your very existence, your very life, is in the ocean.\nIt is within you\nThe ocean is your everything,\nbut for the ocean, you are nothing.\nFor this very reason\nthe fish couldn’t see the ocean!\nAnd for this very reason we are unable to find God. But He can be found by being empty.\nIn the state of emptiness we meet Him for God is emptiness.\nI am in bliss, or shall I say –\nBliss alone is and I am not! 11\nMy respects to you.\nI received your letter, I was waiting for it. The trip to Rajnagar was blissful.\nReligion robbed of the spirit of yoga has become a matter of morality only, thereby losing its soul.\nMorality is negative.\nLife cannot be based on negation, negation cannot nourish life.\nThe emphasis has to be on attainment not on renunciation.\nIt is not a question of renouncing ignorance but of attaining understanding,\nit is this that has to be central.\nPractise has to be positive\nand this sadhana can happen through yoga. In my talks with Acharya Tulsi, Muni Shri Nathamaljee and others\nI have stressed this point.\nMany letters have come from Rajnagar and Rajasthan in this connection; as you have said\nit seems some fruitful work has been accomplished by going there.\nOne thing is very clear:\npeople are eager for a spiritual life and current forms of religion do not satisfy them.\nIf however the right religion is given to them it can revolutionize human consciousness. I think of you.\nMay God grant you peace. My love and regards to all. 12\nMy respects to you.\nAll your letters arrived in good time\nbut as I have been busy I could not reply sooner.\nI have been out most of the time\nand I have just returned after speaking in Jaipur,\nBurhanpur, Hoshangabad, Chanda and other places.\nHow thirsty people are for spiritual life! Seeing this\nI am surprised that some people say man has lost all interest in religion.\nThis can never be.\nNo interest in religion means no interest in life, bliss, the ultimate.\nConsciousness is by nature God-oriented and it can only be satisfied by attaining God the state of satchitananda, the\ntruth-awareness-bliss state of being.\nHidden within one in the form of a seed is the very source of religious birth, therefore whilst religions may come ant go religion can never die.\nI am glad to know that you feel patient about your progress towards the light.\nPatience is the most important thing of all in spiritual life.\nHow long one must wait after sowing the seed!\nAt first all the effort seems wasted, nothing seems\nto happen, and then one day the waiting ends and there is actuality – the seed breaks, pushes through the\nearth – into a plant!\nBut remember that even when nothing seemed to be happening the seed was working away under the soil. It is the same with the seeker for truth – when nothing appears to be happening much is happening.\nThe fact is that all growth of life-energy is unseen and unknown.\nOnly the results can be observed not the progress. I am in bliss.\nI want you to come closer to God.\nForget about results, just keep going on your path; let the fruits come by themselves.\nOne day one wonders: What has happened!\nWhat was I!\nWhat have I become!\nCompared to the results all the effort seems negligible.\nMy love to all.\n13\nMy respects to you.\nI have just returned from Rajnagar in Rajasthan. I was invited to a religious function there organized by Acharya Shree Tulsi.\nI put four hundred monks and nuns through an experiment in meditation. The results were extraordinary.\nIn my view\nmeditation is the essence of all religious practice.\nAll the rest –\nsuch as non-violence, renunciation of wealth, celibacy etc. – are just its consequences.\nWith the attainment of samadhi, the culmination of meditation,\nall these things come by themselves, they just happen naturally.\nSince we forgot this central sadhana\nall our efforts have been external and superficial. True sadhana IS not just ethical,\nit is basically yoga practice.\nEthics ALONE are negative\nand nothing enduring can be constructed on negation.\nYoga is positive and can therefore form a base. I want to convey this positive basis to all.\n14\nLove.\nI have received your very affectionate letter. You write that my words ring in your ears; what I want is for their echo to carry you\ninto that space where everything is silent, empty. This is the way from words to emptiness.\nThere one meets oneself. I am in bliss.\nTake my love\nI have nothing else to offer, it is my only wealth. The marvel of it is that the more of it you give the more it becomes.\nReal wealth is like that –\nit grows as you give it away; and if it diminishes – it is not wealth at all.\nWrite again,\nfor not only do you wait for my letters, I too wait for yours.\n15\nLove.\nOn returning from the meditation camp I had to leave town again.\nI returned only last night but I thought of you all the time.\nI cannot forget the thirst for God I saw in your eyes\nand the striving for truth in your heart.\nThis is a blessing because no one can attain without passing through this anguish.\nRemember, thirst is a prerequisite for the birth of light and love.\nTogether, light and love are God.\nWhen love has no limits its flame becomes smokeless and so divine.\nI have seen the seeds of this growth within you and it fills my soul with great joy.\nThe seed is there, now it has to become a tree. It could be that the time is at hand.\nGod-realization cannot happen without meditation so\nyou must turn towards this now with courage and perseverance.\nI have great hopes – will you fulfil them? My regards to other friends there.\nI wait for your letter.\nRemember what I said about the blank paper? Everything else is fine.\nI am in bliss. 16\nLove.\nI received your letter.\nWhat you say has made me very happy.\nWords that come out of the depth and fullness of heart echo the infinite\njust as a tiny flower expresses infinite beauty.\nWhen love breathes life into words what is expressed is\nnot what is said\nbut what wants to be said. Inside each of us there is a poet, there is poetry,\nbut because we live on the surface these are never born.\nThose who go deep\nawaken divine love\nand this love fills their lives\nwith music, beauty, peace and poetry – their very lives become music\nand on to this stage truth descends. Truth will descend where there is music so life must be turned into a melody.\nOnly through music can one reach the truth. You too have to become music,\nthe entire life, every little act, has to be turned into music:\nthis happens through love. Whatever is – love it.\nFeel love for the whole world. Feeling love for all with every breath brings the inner music.\nHave you ever seen this happen? See this,\nfill yourself with love and see. Whatever breaks up the inner music – that alone is irreligion, that alone is sin, and whatever fills us with music –\nthat is religion, that alone is religion. Love is religion\nbecause love is beauty, love is music.\nLove is God\nbecause it is all that is needed to attain Him.\nGive my love to everybody there\nand feel the light of my love beside you. 17\nLove.\nI have received your letter.\nYou long for the peace I have within me. It is yours any time.\nIt is the deepest possibility in everyone, it only has to be uncovered.\nAs springs of water lie hidden under layers of earth so does bliss lie hidden within us.\nThe possibility is there for everyone but only those who dig for it can redeem it.\nThe excavation of these hidden treasures lies through religion.\nDigging with it one reaches the well of light within.\nI have shown you how to dig and what with, but the digging has to be done by you.\nI know your soil is absolutely ready, with very\nlittle effort the infinite streams can be reached. This state of mind is attained with the greatest good fortune so don’t waste it or miss this opportunity.\nFill yourself with determination and leave the rest to God.\nTruth runs alongside will.\nDon’t hesitate to write, I have lots of time for you.\nI am for those who need me – nothing in my life is for myself.\n18\nLove,\nso much love.\nI received your letter when I got back.\nI could feel the ardour of your heart through your words.\nI well know the fervour that stirs your soul\nand the thirst that turns into tears within you. I was once there too, I too have suffered it.\nI can well understand your heart because I have travelled those same paths you now have to take in the quest for God. I too have experienced the longing that one day turns into a raging fire in which one has to\nconsume oneself.\nBut this burning brings the birth of a new life.\nThe drop can only become the ocean when it ceases to exist.\nContinue your efforts in meditation;\nyou have to go deeper and deeper into it – it is the only way.\nThrough it and it alone call one reach life’s truth.\nRemember:\nlf you become absorbed in sadhana, fully committed and surrendered, you are bound to reach the truth.\nThis is an eternal law.\nNo step taken towards God is ever wasted. My regards to all.\n19\nMy respects to you.\nYour letters were received.\nI have just got back from a camp at Ranakpur. It was just for friends from Rajasthan, that’s why you weren’t informed.\nIt lasted five days and about sixty people participated.\nIt was a wonderful success and it was obvious that much happened.\nEncouraged by the results the organizers are planning a camp on an all-India basis.\nYou must come to that.\nI am glad to hear your meditation is progressing. You have only to be silent.\nTo be silent is everything.\nSilence does not mean absence of speech, it means absence of thoughts.\nWhen the mind quietens down it becomes linked to the infinite.\nDon’t do anything, just sit and watch the flow of thoughts, just watch.\nThis just watching dissolves thought by itself.\nThe awakening of witnessing brings freedom from the modifications of the mind.\nWith thoughts finished, consciousness is. This is samadhi.\nLove to all friends. 20\nLove\nLast night when lamps and lamps were lit up all over town\nI thought: My Sohan too, must have lit lamps and a few among them must surely be for me!\nAnd then I began to see the lamps you had lit, and also those your love has kept lit always.\nI shall stay here another day.\nI have talked of you to everybody and they are eager to meet you.\n21\nBeloved!\nYour letter came, and your photo too. You look really simple and innocent in it! Such love and devotion!\nThe heart when purified by love turns into a temple and I can see this clearly in your photo.\nMay God help this simple innocence grow!\nTwo thousand years ago someone asked Christ: Who can enter the kingdom of heaven\nJesus pointed to a little child and said:\nThose whose hearts are as innocent as a child’s. Looking at your picture today, I remembered this story.\n22\nLove.\nI have only just arrived here, the train was five\nhours late.\nYou wanted me to write as soon as I got here so I am doing so.\nThroughout the journey I thought of you and of the tears falling from your eyes.\nNothing in the world is more sacred than tears of love and joy.\nSuch tears, so pure, are not of this world. Though part of the body, they express something which is not.\nWhatever can I give you in return. 23\nLove.\nI looked for your letter as soon as I got here yesterday.\nThough it was Sunday, I kept waiting for it.\nIt came this evening – how much you write in so few words!\nWhen the heart is full it pours into the words and so few are needed.\nAn ocean of love can be contained in just a jug! As for scriptures on love – it is enough to know the four letters of the word!\nDo you know how many times I read through your\nletters?\n24\nLove.\nYour letter arrived this morning. The garland you have weaved from flowers of love\nhas a fragrance that I can catch! And the love-vine you have sown spreads through my heart!\nThe tears of your love and joy bring light and strength to my eyes! How blissful it all is!\n25\nLove.\nI am in bliss.\nIt was good that you met me in Bombay,\nmy heart was overjoyed to see what is happening in you.\nThis is how a person prepares\nand moves along the stairway towards truth. Life is a dual journey:\none journey is in time and space the other is within oneself and truth. The first ends in death\nthe second in deathlessness.\nThe second is the real journey because it takes you somewhere.\nThose who take the first journey as it, waste their lives\nthe real life begins the day you start the other journey.\nA really good beginning has taken place in your consciousness\nand I am filled with bliss to feel this. 26\nLove.\nOn my return home from the tour I looked for your letter.\nIt came together with the grapes\nso the letter, already sweet, became still sweeter. I am in bliss.\nYour love enhances it yet more and the love of all makes it infinite. One body – so much bliss!\nWhat else can others do but envy he who feels all bodies to be his!\nMay God make you envious of me, may everybody envy me,\nthis is my prayer. 27\nLove.\nYour letter reached me\nas I was sitting on that very same spot on the grass!\nWhat I was thinking then\nI shall tell you only when we meet.\nWhat a fragrance memories leave behind!\nWhen life is filled with love it is so blissful\nLife’s only paupers\nare those without love in their hearts, and how to describe the good fortune\nof those whose hearts hold nothing but love!\nIn moments of such abundance one encounters God.\nOnly love alone have I known as God. 28\nLove.\nI received your letter.\nI am blissful to learn of your bliss This for me IS bliss\nWith every breath\nI pray for all to be filled with bliss. This is my understanding of religion.\nThe religion that ends in temples, mosques, churches,\nis a dead religion.\nA religion that fails to go beyond dead words and doctrines\nhas no significance\nAn authentic and living religion unites one with the whole\nand leads one to the whole.\nReligion is whatever unites you with the cosmos.\nWhatever feelings\nlead you towards this marvellous meeting and merging\nare prayers,\nand all those prayers can be expressed in a single word;\nthat word is love. What does love want?\nLove wants to share with all the bliss it has.\nLove wants to share itself with everyone!\nTo give of oneself unconditionally – that is love.\nTo love\nis to dedicate one’s being to the whole as the drop surrenders to the sea.\nI pulsate with such love.\nIt has filled my life with nectar and light. Now I have only one wish:\nthat what has happened to me should happen to all! Give my love to everyone there.\n29\nLove.\nI received your letter.\nHow did you hurt your finger?\nIt sounds as if you are not taking care of your body.\nAnd why the restless mind?\nIn this dreamlike world there is nothing worth making the mind restless for.\nPeace is the greatest bliss and there is nothing worth losing it for.\nMeditate on it.\nJust being aware of the truth brings about inner change.\nI think you won’t be coming to Udaipur to assist me and that’s on your mind.\nCome if you can,\nif you can’t – never mind,\nyou are helping me all the time. Isn’t one’s love help enough?\nIf you don’t come I will miss you\nbecause the camp at Udaipur is linked for me with being with you, so I am hoping you can come.\nRegards to all.\n30\nLove,\nand lots of it.\nI looked at once for your letter\namongst the pile waiting for me on my return. I can’t tell you how glad I was to get it – written by hand, too.\nYou write: Now your presence is felt in your absence.\nlove really IS presence. Where there is love space and time vanish,\nand where there is no love\nEven what is near in space and time keeps immeasurably apart.\nOnly lovelessness separates\nand love is the only nearness.\nThose who find total love\ndiscover everything within themselves.\nThe whole world then is inside, not outside and the moon and stars lie in the inner sky. In this fullness of love, ego vanishes.\nI want God to lead you to this fullness. 31\nI arrived here yesterday\nand have been thinking of writing ever since but it didn’t happen until now.\nForgive the delay though even a single day’s delay is no small delay!\nWhat shall I say about the return journey? It was very blissful.\nI kept sleeping, and you were with me.\nIt appeared I had left you behind but actually you were still with me.\nThis is the being-together that is so real that it cannot be divided.\nPhysical nearness is not nearness, there can be no union on that level, only an unbridgeable gulf, but there is another nearness which is not of the body, and its name is love.\nOnce gained it is never lost.\nThen no separation exists despite vast distances in the visible world.\nIf you can arrive at this distancelessness with even one other it can be found with everybody. One is the door, the all, the goal.\nThe beginning of love is through ONE, the end is ALL.\nThe love that unites you with everything, with nothing excluded, I call religion, and the love that stops ANYWHERE I call sin.\n32\nI received your letter;\nI have been waiting for it ever since I returned. But how sweet it is to wait!\nLife itself is a waiting! Seeds wait to sprout, rivers to reach the ocean. What does man wait for?\nHe too is the seed for some tree, a river for some ocean.\nWhoever looks deep inside\nfinds that a longing for the endless and boundless is his very being,\nand whoever recognizes this begins his journey towards God\nbecause who can be thirsty and not look for water? This has never happened and never will!\nWhere there is longing, there is thirst for attainment.\nI want to make everyone aware of this thirst.\nI want to convert everyone’s life into a waiting. The life that has turned into a waiting for God is the true life.\nAll other ways of life are just a waste, a disaster.\n33\nLove.\nI received your letter.\nIts poetry filled my heart.\nIt is said that poetry is born out of love in your letter I saw this happen.\nWhere there is love\nthe whole existence becomes a poem;\nthe flowers of life bloom under the light of love.\nIt is strange that you ask\nwhy my heart holds so much love for you. Can love ever be caused?\nIf it is,\ncan it be called love?\nOh, my mad friend! love is always uncaused! This is its mystery,\nand its purity.\nLove is divine\nand belongs to the kingdom of God because it is uncaused.\nAs for me\nl am filled with love\nas a lamp is filled with light.\nTo see this light one needs eyes.\nYou have those eyes so you saw the light. The credit is yours, not mine.\n34\nLove.\nI never imagined that you would write such a loving letter!\nAnd you say that you are uneducated!\nThere is no knowledge greater than love, and those who lack love – these are the true illiterates, because the heart is the real thing in life not the intellect.\nBliss and light spring from the heart not from the\nmind, and you have so much heart – that is enough! Can there be a better witness of this than me?\nI am surprised that you write asking me to point out any mistakes you have made.\nSo far on earth, love has not made one mistake. All mistakes happen through lack of love,\nin fact this for me is the only mistake in life.\nWriting you you: May God make you envious of me was no mistake.\nI would like the bliss that has arisen in my heart to make you thirst for it more and more.\nQueen of Mewal! there is no reason for you to worry about it!\n35\nLove.\nIt was just this time of night, two days ago that I left you at Chittor.\nI can see now\nthe love and bliss filling your eyes.\nThe secret of all prayer and worship\nis hidden in the overflow of those tears. They are sacred.\nGod fills the heart of those he blesses with tears of love,\nand what to say about the calamity\nof those whose hearts are filled instead with thorns of hate?\nTears flowing in love\nare offerings of flowers at the feet of God\nand the eyes from which they flow are blessed with divine vision.\nOnly eyes filled with love can see God.\nLove is the only energy\nthat transcends the inertia of nature and takes one to the shores of ultimate awareness.\nI think that by the time this letter reaches you you will already have left for Kashidham.\nI don’t know how your journey was\nbut I hope it passed in song and laughter. Give my kind respects to everyone there. I am waiting, for your promised letters.\n36\nLove.\nI was very happy to meet you the other day.\nI felt the stirrings of your heart and the longing of your soul.\nYou have not yet flowered as you were born to: the seed is ready to sprout and the soil is right you will\nnot have long to wait.\nBut now you have to work with great determination. It is only a matter of starting the journey,\nGod’s gravitational pull does the rest. 37\nLove.\nIt is good that you are forgetting the past\nit will open up an altogether new dimension of life.\nTo live completely in the present is freedom.\nThe past does not exist apart from memory and nor does the future apart from castles in the air.\nWhat is, is always present, and if you start living unreservedly in the present\nyou live in God.\nonce you are free of past and future the mind turns empty and peaceful,\nits waves die down\nand what is left is limitless, endless. This is the ocean of truth –\nand may your river reach it!\nP.S. I shall probably go to Ahmedabad in January, can you come with me?\nIt would be good if we travelled together for a few\ndays. 38\nLove.\nI am glad to see such thirst for God! To have this thirst is a divine blessing; where there is thirst – there the way is.\nIn fact, intense longing becomes the way.\nGod is summoning us at every moment\nbut because the strings of our heart are slack we don’t echo His call.\nIf our eyes are closed then even if the sun is at the door we will be in darkness;\nand the sun is always at the door – we only have to open our eyes and let it in, that’s all!\nMay God give you light, that’s my wish. My love and I are always with you.\nRegards to the family and love to the children. 39\nLove.\nI have your letter.\nThe wheel of the world keeps spinning but why spin with it?\nSee what is behind body and mind; that has never moved,\nis not moving, can never move,\nand thou art that, tat twam asi.\nWaves lie on the surface of this ocean but in its depths – what is THERE?\nWhen the waves are taken for the ocean it is a terrible mistake.\nLook at the wheel of a bullock cart:\nthe wheel turns because the axle does not; so remember your own axle,\nstanding, sitting, asleep or awake, keep it in mind.\nBy and by, one begins to encounter the changeless behind all change. You have asked me about the poem.\nI had a little piece read out by someone, then it came to me: I should hear it from you yourself!\nNow when you read it out to me I shall listen – and then I can read both you and your poem. 40\nLove.\nI received your letter on my return.\nI welcome this birth of determination in you.\nSuch strength of will alone takes us to truth.\nOur deepest powers are aroused by it,\nthe unorganized energy becomes organized and then there is music.\nWhat tremendous energy exists in this atom of self!\nBut it can’t be known without utter intensity of will.\nYou must have seen rocks that even the strongest chisel\ncannot break,\nand yet the sprouting shrub or plant\nslips cracks and crevices through it so easily! When the tiniest seed is filled with determination to push through and reach the sun,\neven the hardest rock has to give way.\nSo a weak seed wins over the mighty rocks! The tender seed breaks through the hardest of rocks!\nWhy?\nBecause no matter how strong and powerful the rock, it is dead,\nand because it is dead it has no will. The seed is tender,\nit is weak, but alive!\nRemember, where there is will there is life and where there is no will there is no life. The seed’s will becomes its power.\nand with this power its tiny roots sprout,\nenter the rock and spread out, until one day they break the rock. Life always wins over death.\nThe living force within has never been defeated by the dead obstacles without – and never will be.\n41\nLove.\nYour letter was received with joy When the heart thirsts so much for truth,\nfor peace, for religion,\none day you come face to face with the sun which dispels all life’s darkness.\nThirst!\nPray!\nStrive!\nWait!\nA journey of a thousand miles is covered step by small step,\nso don’t lose heart.\nVast distances can be covered one step at a time and an ocean filled drop by drop.\nMy regards to all.\nI shall be coming soon now. The rest when we meet.\n42\nLove.\nYour Letter has arrived.\nYou ask me about sex.\nThat energy too belongs to God\nand through meditation it too can be transformed. No energy is bad but there can, of course, be wrong use of energy.\nWhen sex energy flows upwards it turns into brahmacharya (celibacy).\nIt is good that you are becoming detached from it but that isn’t enough.\nYou have to go through it to transform it, rejection just leaves you arid and dry!\nIt is true you are not alone in your sex life\nbut sex is not essentially of the body at all but a modification of the mind.\nIf the mind is completely transformed it affects the other person too,\nand one who is related so intimately is quickly affected.\nUntil we meet, keep in mind that:\nthere should be no calculated ill-will towards sex – cultivated detachment is useless:\nstay aware whilst making love, be a witness in this situation;\nif one can stay in a state of meditation and right-mindfulness\nthen the sex energy can be successfully transformed.\nWe shall talk more about this when we meet. Brahmacharya is a complete science in itself and many doors to bliss open on that path.\nStill, the very first thing is\na friendly attitude towards all one’s energies. Enmity towards them does not lead to spiritual revolution\nbut to self-destruction.\nGive my regards to all there.\nYou are not coming to Poona – I shall miss you. 43\nLove.\nYou have asked me about sense of humour. We can talk about it in detail when we meet but first of all:\nthe sense of humour should be directed towards oneself –\nit is a very great thing to laugh at oneself and he who can laugh at himself\ngradually becomes full of concern and compassion for others.\nIn the entire world\nno event, no subject, invites laughter like oneself.\nAbout the truth of dreams as well we shall have to talk in detail.\nSome dreams are definitely true.\nAs the mind quietens down\nglimpses of truth begin to appear in dreams.\nDreams are of four kinds\n– those concerned with past lives,\n– those concerned with the future,\n– those concerned with the present,\n– and those concerned with repressed desires. Contemporary psychology knows something about the fourth type only.\nI am glad to know that your mind moves towards being at peace.\nMind is what we want it to be,\npeace and restlessness are both our own creations.\nMan binds himself with his own chains\nand so he is always at liberty to become free of the mind.\n44\nLove.\nWhat gift is greater than love?\nAnd still you ask – What have I given? Oh, mad one!\nWhen love is given\nthere is nothing left to give, not even the giver,\nfor to give love is to give oneself. You have given yourself,\nnow where are you?\nHaving lost yourself,\nnow you are bound to find\nthe one you have been longing to meet.\nNow she has been born, and I am a witness to it,\nI have watched it happen.\nI can hear the music that you are going to be. The other day,\nwhen your heart was close to me. I heard it.\nIntellect knows of the present\nbut for the heart the future is also the present. 45\nLove.\nI received your letter.\nThe time of my birth will have to be looked up.\nI think the day was the eleventh of December, but even this is not certain.\nBut tell your astrologer friend not to worry; the future will simply come, there’s no point in worrying about it.\nWhatever happens – ultimately it is all the same.\nDust returns unto dust\nand life disappears like a line drawn on water. My regards to everyone.\n46\nLove.\nIt is a long time since I received your letter, you must be tired of waiting for a reply.\nStill, patient waiting has its own joy. On the path to God,\ntimeless waiting is the true sadhana. Waiting and waiting and waiting.\nAnd then,\njust as a bud blooms, everything happens by itself.\nYou are coming to Nargol, aren’t you? My regards to all.\n47\nLove.\nI was glad to receive your letter. Truth is unknown,\nand to know it one has to die to the known. Once the banks of the known are left behind one enters the ocean of the unknown.\nBe brave and take the jump!\nInto emptiness, the great emptiness! Because that’s where God lives.\nLove to all,\nor to the only one!\nFor only THE ONE is.\nHe alone is. He is in all.\nHe is in all and in the emptiness also. 48\nLove.\nI have your letter and your question. Wherever I is there is a barrier;\nIn fact, the i-attitude is the one and only barrier,\nso sleeping, waking, sitting, walking – always be aware of it;\nsee it, recognize it\nand remember it\nwherever and whenever it comes, for recognition spells its death.\nIt is not the truth but just a dream,\nand as soon as one becomes aware of dreaming the dream vanishes.\nDreams cannot be renounced –\nhow can you give up that which is not? To be aware of it is enough.\nEgo is man’s dream, his sleep,\nso those who try to renounce it fall into yet another illusion.\nTheir humility, their egolessness are simply more dreams –\nlike dreaming you are waking whilst still dreaming. Don’t fall into this trap.\nJust keep in mind one thing:\nWake up and see! Regards to everyone there. 49\nLove.\nI am so happy to have got your letter. Can even a ray of love ever come without the fragrance of joy?\nAnd what is joy but the fragrance of love Yet the world is full of mad people seeking happiness their whole lives – but with their backs turned towards love!\nThe doors to God only open\nwhen love turns into the prayer of our total being. But perhaps HIS doors are already open,\nyet eyes dosed to love\nwill, even so, never be able to see them.\nAnd what is this you write? Momentary contact?\nNo! No! How can love’s contact be so? Love turns even a moment into eternity.\nWhere there is love\nthere is nothing momentary, where there is love\nthere is eternity.\nIs a drop just a drop?\nNo! No! It is the ocean!\nThe drop seen through eyes of love becomes the ocean!\n50\nLove.\nI have got your letter.\nI know well how your soul thirsts; soon it can be quenched –\nyou are right at the brink of the lake; you only have to open your eyes,\nand I can see that the lids are about to lift. I shall be with you then,\nalways with you, so don’t worry.\nBe patient and wait;\nthe seed takes its own time to break and bloom. Give my regards to all.\nMore when we meet.\n51\nLove.\nI received your letter. I am always with you. Don’t be worried, don’t be sad,\nand leave your sadhana in the hands of God. Let His will be done.\nBe like a dry leaf,\nlet the winds take you where they will –\nisn’t this what is meant by shunya (emptiness)? Do not swim,\njust float.\nIsn’t this what is meant by shunya? My regards to all.\n52\nLove.\nYour letter has come.\nLove has not to be asked for – it is never obtained by asking; love comes through giving –\nit is our own echo.\nYou feel my love pouring on you\nbecause you have become a river of love flowing towards me,\nand when your love flows like this towards all you will find the whole world flowing in love towards you.\nTo respond with unconditional love towards all, towards that which is,\nis the God-experience. 53\nLove.\nCan two persons ever meet?\nIt is just not possible on this earth, communication seems impossible – but at times the impossible happens. The other day it did.\nBeing with you, I felt meeting IS possible, and also communication,\nand without words, too. Your tears answered me.\nI am deeply grateful for those tears. Such response is very rare.\nI have seen your madhu shala, seen it again and again.\nIf I could sing\nI would sing the same song that is there. I call that sannyas the real sannyas which accepts the world with joy.\nAren’t samsara and moksha really one? Duality exists in ignorance,\nin knowledge there is only one.\nOh, can that really be religion\nwhich cannot sing and dance the songs of bliss auld love?\nP.S. I hear you are due to come here.\nCome, and come soon.\nWho can trust time –\nLook – it is morning and the sun rises; how long will it be before it sets?\n54\nLove.\nI am one with all things – in beauty,\nin ugliness,\nfor whatsoever is – there I am.\nNot only in virtue\nbut in sin too I am a partner, and not only heaven\nbut hell too is mine. Buddha, Jesus, Lao Tzu – it is easy to be their heir,\nbut Genghis, Taimur and Hitler? They are also within me!\nNo, not half – I am the whole of mankind! Whatsoever is man’s is mine flowers and thorns, darkness as well as light,\nand if nectar is mine, whose is poison? Nectar and poison – both are mine.\nWhoever experiences this I call religious,\nfor only the anguish of such experience can revolutionize life on earth.\n55\nI have received your letter.\nI was very glad indeed to get it, more so since you have sent a blank sheet.\nBut I have read in it all that you have not written but wanted to write.\nBesides, what can words say?\nEven after writing, what you had meant to write remains unwritten. so your silent letter is very\nlovely.\nAs it is, whenever you come to see me you are mostly silent, but your eyes tell all, and your silence too.\nSome deep thirst has touched you, some unknown shore has called you.\nWhenever God calls He calls this way – but how long will you go on standing on the shore?\nLook! The sun is out and the winds can’t wait to fill the boat’s sails!\n56\nLove.\nI have received your letters – but they are not\njust letters really, they are poems born out of love, out of love and prayer, for where there is love there is prayer.\nSo it is possible to get glimpses of God through another whom one loves – love providing the eyes that can see God.\nLove is the door through which He appears.\nSo when one loves all he can be seen in all things. Part and whole in fact are not in opposition: deep love for even one other finally spreads to all because love dissolves the self; leaving the no-self.\nLove is like the sun, the individual like frozen ice.\nLove’s sun melts the icebergs leaving a limitless ocean.\nSo the search for love is really the search for\nGod, because love melts, and also destroys; because love only melts and only destroys.\nIt is both birth and death.\nIn it the self dies and THE ALL is born.\nSo there is certainly pain – in the birth as well as in the death.\nLove is a deep anguish of birth as well as death. But the poetry flowering in you shows that you have begun to experience the joy that lies in love’s anguish.\n57\nLove.\nYour letter has filled my heart with joy.\nYou are at the threshold of a great revolution;\nnow, even if you want to run away I will not let you.\nYou will certainly have to perish in it. so that you can be reborn.\nGold has to pass through fire – only then is it purified.\nLove is fire for you and I pray to God that your ego burns in it.\nThen if love comes, prayer can come too; without love. prayer is not possible.\nRemember that body and soul are not two. The part of the person that can be seen is the body, the part that cannot be seen is the soul.\nThe same holds true for God and matter: God made visible is matter and what cannot be seen is God.\nTake life easily and naturally, just as it comes. Welcome it in its endless forms with an attitude of complete acceptance.\nAnd do not impose yourself on life; life has its own discipline, its own wisdom,\nand those who are ready to live totally\nhave no need for any other discipline or wisdom. But you have always been afraid of life and therefore you are afraid of love.\nNow life has begun penetrating you, breaking your walls of security.\nSo, God’s infinite grace showers on you! Don’t run from it now, accept it gratefully and my good wishes are always with you. 58\nLove.\nBe aware in the waking state, don’t try to become aware in sleep or dreams.\nIf you become aware in the waking state awareness\nin dreams and sleep comes easily – but you don’t have to do anything for it, doing only creates difficulties.\nSleep reflects the waking state: what we are when awake we are in sleep.\nIf we are asleep in the waking state only then is\nsleep really SLEEP; the stream of thoughts during the waking state becomes the web of dreams in sleep.\nBeing aware in the waking state will begin to reflect itself in sleep too, and if there are no thoughts in the waking state dreams disappear altogether in sleep.\nEverything else is fine.\nMy regards to everyone there. 59\nLove.\nI was overjoyed to receive your letter – as pure and innocent as your heart.\nYou want to write that which cannot be written so you send an unwritten letter.\nThis is good, for it is better to remain silent\nabout that which cannot be expressed, but beware! silence also speaks, it speaks and speaks so much! Silence can speak even where words fail.\nThe void envelops even that which lines cannot contain, in fact what can resist the embrace of the great void?\nNothing is left unsaid by silence.\nWhere words fail, silence is full of meaning. Where form ends, the formless begins.\nWhere knowledge (VEDA) ends, transcendental knowledge (VEDANTA) begins. When knowledge dies, the beyond begins.\nFreedom from the word is truth. 60\nLove.\nHow can I describe how happy I am to have received your letter?\nWhenever I saw you, only one question arose in my mind –\nHow long are you going to keep away from me?\nI knew you had to come closer to me, it was only a matter of time, so I kept waiting and praying for you. To me, prayerful waiting is love.\nI also knew you were going through the pangs of a\nnew birth and that rebirth is very near – for only this can give soul to your songs.\nWords are the form and form has its own beauty, its own melody, its own music, but this is not enough, and he who considers this enough remains discontented for ever.\nThe soul of poetry lies in silence.\nTo me, prayerful waiting is love, and the void is the door to the divine temple.\nYou have come to me and I want to take you to the Lord for how can you come close to me without first coming closer to Him?\nIn fact without coming close to Him you cannot come close even to yourself.\nThen as so on as you come near Him you attain that life for which you have gone through so many lives. To come close to oneself is to be reborn – the principle of being twice born is just this.\nAnd remember, not even the pebbles lying on the road are just pebbles; they too await a new birth, for that second birth turns them into diamonds.\nP.S. To run after desires is to run after a mirage.\nIt is a journey from one death to another.\nIn the illusion that is life man dies this way time\nand time again.\nBut those willing to die to their desires discover that death itself dies for them.\n61\nLove.\nWhere is truth?\nDo not search for it for when has truth ever been found through seeking? for in seeking, the seeker is present.\nSo don’t seek but lose yourself. He who loses himself finds truth. I don’t say: seek and you will find. I say: he who loses himself, finds. 62\nLove.\nI was happy to receive your letter.\nThe drop doesn’t have to become the ocean. it already is the ocean.\nit just has to know it.\nWhat IS,\nhowever it is,\nto know it as it is, is truth.\nAnd truth liberates.\n63\nLove.\nLife is an infinite mystery, therefore those who are filled with knowledge are deprived of life.\nLife becomes known only to the innocent, to those whose intuition is not covered with the dust of knowledge.\n64\nLove.\nDo not seek nirvana as something opposed to life, rather, turn life itself into nirvana.\nThose who know, do this.\nDogen has these beautiful words to say: Do not strive after moksha (liberation); rather, allow all your actions to become liberating.\nThis happens.\nI can tell you this from my own experience; and the day it happens\nlife becomes as beautiful as a flower in full bloom and brims with fragrance.\n65\nLove.\nI received your letter on my return.\nJust as the seed within the soil waits for the rains so you wait for God.\nPrayerful wholehearted surrender is the door leading to Him.\nLet yourself go completely just like a boat\nfloating on the river; you do not have to row the boat, just let it go loose; you are not to swim, just to\nfloat, then the river itself takes you to the ocean. The ocean is very near – but only for those who float but do not swim.\nDo not be afraid of drowning because that fear\nmakes you swim – and the truth is that he who drowns himself in God is saved for ever; and do not have a goal, for he who has a goal begins to swim.\nRemember always – wherever one reaches, that is a the destination, therefore he who makes God his goal goes astray.\nWherever the mind is free from all goals – there alone is God.\n66\nLove.\nI say: Die, so that you can live!\nWhen the seed destroys itself, it becomes the tree; when the drop loses itself, it becomes the ocean.\nBut man – man refuses to lose himself. How then can God manifest in him?\nMan IS the seed, God is the tree. Man is the drop, God is the ocean. 67\nLove.\nLeave the old track –\nonly the dead walk on trodden paths; life is the continuous quest for the new.\nOnly he who has the flair to be new every moment truly lives.\nDie to the old every moment so that you are for ever new –\nthis is the crux of the transformation of life. 68\nLove.\nTruth is like the sky: eternal, everlasting, boundless.\nIs there a door to enter the sky?\nThen how can there be one to enter into truth? If our eyes are closed, the sky exists not.\nThe same holds good for truth.\nOpening the eyes is the door to truth; closing the eyes is to close that door to truth.\n69\nLove.\nWhere to find truth?\nWell, it has to be sought within one’s own self, within one’s own self\nwithin one’s own self within one’s own self It is definitely there.\nOne who seeks it elsewhere loses it. 70\nLove.\nI am extremely grateful for your loving letter.\nI take life as a whole and I am incapable of viewing it in bits and pieces; it is already the whole\nbut because it has been viewed in fragments for so long it has become perverted.\nThere is no politics, no morality, no religion;\nthere is LIFE, there is God, whole and unfragmented.\nIt has to be sought, recognized and lived in all\nits forms, therefore I shall continue to speak on all its forms.\nAnd this is only the beginning.\nAnswering journalists is just preparing the ground. All paths lead to one end – certain friends might\ntake some time to understand this truth.\nAs things are, this delay in understanding the truth is unavoidable, but seekers of truth won’t be afraid – courage is the first condition in the search for truth.\nRemember, as long as spirituality does not become a philosophy of the whole life it proves impotent, and only escapists will take shelter behind it.\nSpirituality has to be turned into a force, spirituality has to be turned into a revolution, only then can spirituality be saved.\nMy regards to all.\n71\nLove.\nMan becomes a slave because he is afraid to be alone, so he needs a crowd, a society, an organization.\nFear is the basis of all institutions, and how can a frightened mind know the truth?\nTruth requires fearlessness and fearlessness comes from sadhana, not from societies, that is why all religions, institutions and organization, bar the path of truth.\n72\nLove.\nDon’t be in a hurry.\nSo often, hurrying causes delay.\nAs you thirst, wait patiently – the deeper the waiting the sooner it comes.\nYou have sown the seed, now sit in the shade and watch what happens.\nThe seed will break, it will blossom, but you cannot speed the process.\nDoesn’t everything need time?\nWork you must, but leave the results to God. Nothing in life is ever wasted, especially steps taken towards truth.\nBut at times impatience comes, impatience comes with thirst, but this is an obstacle.\nKeep the thirst and throw the impatience. Do not confuse impatience with thirst.\nWith thirst there is yearning but no struggle with impatience there is struggle but no yearning.\nWith longing there is waiting but no demanding with impatience there is demanding but no waiting.\nWith thirst there are silent tears with impatience there is restless struggle.\nTruth cannot be raided, it is attained through\nsurrender not through struggle.\nIt is conquered through total surrender. 73\nLove.\nYour letter has been received. Why seek at all for a purpose?\nIf you seek this you will never find it because it is eternally hidden in the seeker.\nLife is without purpose – life is its own purpose, therefore he who lives without purpose truly lives. Live! Isn’t living itself enough?\nThe desire to have more than just life is a result of not properly living – and that is why the fear of\ndeath grips the human mind, for what is death to one who is really alive!\nWhere living is intense and total there is no time to fear death – and there is no time for death, either.\nDo not think in the language of purpose – that language is diseased in itself.\nThe sky exists without purpose.\nGod is without purpose flowers bloom without purpose\nand stars shine without purpose –\nwhat has happened to poor man that he cannot live without purpose!\nBecause man can think he gets into trouble. A little thinking always leads to trouble.\nIf you must think, think completely, utterly! Then the mind whirls so fast with thoughts that freedom from thoughts is attained.\nThen you begin to live. 74\nLove.\nRest is the supreme goal, work is the medium. Total relaxation, with complete freedom from effort, is the supreme goal.\nThen life is a play, and then even effort becomes play.\nPoetry, philosophy, religion are the fruits of repose.\nThis has not been available to everyone\nbut technology and science will make it so in the near future.\nThat is why I am in favour of technology. Those who attribute intrinsic value to labour oppose the use of machines – they have to.\nFor me, labour has no such intrinsic value: on the\ncontrary, I see it as a burden.\nAs long as work is a prerequisite for rest it cannot be blissful.\nWhen work flows out of a state of rest voluntarily then it is blissful.\nSo I cannot call rest a sin. Nor do I support sacrifice.\nI do not want anyone to live for anybody else, or one generation to sacrifice itself for another.\nSuch sacrifices turn out to be very costly – those who make them expect an inhuman return.\nThis is why fathers expect the impossible from their sons.\nIf each father lives for his son who will live for himself?\nFor every son is a potential father.\nNo, I want everyone to live for himself – for his own happiness, his own state of rest.\nWhen a father is happy he does much more for his son – and easily, because it comes out of his happiness.\nThen there is neither sacrifice nor renunciation; what he does comes naturally out of his being a father –\nand a happy father at that.\nThen he has no inhuman expectations of his son and where there is no pressure from expectations, expectations are fulfilled – out of the son being a son.\nIn short, I teach each person to be selfish.\nAltruistic teachings have taught man nothing but suicide. and a suicidal man is always homicidal; the unhappy sow their sorrow amongst others.\nI am also against the sacrifice of the present for\nthe future, because what is is always present; if you live in it totally the future will be born out of it –\nand when it comes it too will be the present.\nFor he who has the habit of sacrificing the present\nfor the future the future never comes because whatever comes is again always sacrificed for that which has not yet come.\nFinally, you ask why i too work for others and for the future.\nFirst of all, I do not work.\nWhatever I do flows out of my state of rest. I do not swim, I just float.\nNo one can ever do anything for another\nbut if something happens to others out of what I\nam,\nthat is something else,\nand there too I am not the doer. As for the future –\nfor me, the present is everything.\nAnd the past too is also a present – that has passed away;\nand the future too – that is a present that is yet to come.\nLife is always here and now\nso I do not bother about past and future.\nAnd it is amazing that ever since I stopped\nworrying about them they have begun to worry about me! My regards to all there.\n75\nThere is a music which has no sound; the soul is restless for such silent music. There is a love in which the body is not; the soul longs for such unembodied love. There is a truth which has no form;\nthe soul longs for this formless truth. Therefore melodies do not satisfy, bodies do not satisfy\nand forms cannot fulfil the soul.\nBut this lack of fulfillment,\nthis dissatisfaction has to be understood properly, for such understanding ultimately brings about transcendence.\nThen sound becomes the door to the soundless, the body becomes the path to the unembodied, and form becomes the formless.\n76\nLove.\nGod is our only wealth.\nDo not depend on any other wealth,\nriches of any other kind bring only disaster.\nSt. Theresa wanted to set up a large orphanage but at the time she had only three shillings.\nShe wanted to start this enormous project with just this small amount.\nFriends and admirers advised her: Get the funds together first.\nWhat can you do with just three shillings?\nTheresa laughed and said: Naturally Theresa can do nothing with three shillings, but with three shillings PLUS GOD – nothing is impossible!\n77\nLove.\nSamsara is nirvana. sound is mantra,\nand all living beings are God. It depends on how you look.\nThe world is nothing but how one sees it. See! Open your eyes and see!\nWhere is darkness? – there is only light. Where is death?\n– there is only deathlessness. 78\nLove.\nI have received your letter.\nAs the earth thirsts for the rains after a hot summer\nso you are thirsting for God.\nThis thirst becomes an invitation to the divine clouds –\nand the invitation has arrived.\nJust keep drowning yourself in meditation and His grace will definitely pour on you. If you are ready here –\nHe is always ready there.\nLook! Can’t you see His clouds hovering in the sky?\n79\nLove.\nDo not fight with yourself; you are as you are,\ndo not strive to change. Do not swim in life,\njust float,\nlike a leaf on the stream.\nKeep away from sadhanas, mere sadhanas, this is the only sadhana.\nWhere is there to go? What is there to become? What is there to find?\nWhat is, is here and now – Please, stop and see!\nWhat are the animal instincts? What is low? and high?\nWhatever is, is –\nthere is no high, no low. What is animal?\nWhat is divine?\nSo do not condemn, do not praise,\nnor condemn nor praise yourself:\nall differences are of the mind. In truth no differences exist;\nthere, God and animal are one and the same; heaven and hell are just two sides of one coin; SAMSARA and nirvana are two expressions of one unknown.\nAnd do not think about what I have said; if you think you will miss.\nSee. Just see. 80\nLove.\nOn the road to God the only sustenance is infinite hope – hope shining like the north star in darkness,\nhope keeping you company like a shadow in loneliness.\nDark and lonely life’s path certainly is – but only for those without hope.\nThe famous geographical explorer Donald Macmillan was preparing for his journey to the north pole when he received a letter.\nOn it was written:\nTo be opened only when there is no hope of survival. Fifty years passed; the envelope remained with Macmillan as it was – sealed.\nSomeone asked him the reason for this and he\nreplied:\nFor one thing I want to keep faith with the unknown sender, and for another, I have never given up hope. What priceless words! – Ihave never given up hope 81\nLove.\nI am delighted you have taken sannyas.\nA life without the flower of sannyas is like a barren tree.\nSannyas is the supreme music of life.\nIt is not renunciation, on the contrary, it is life’s highest enjoyment.\nSomeone who finds diamonds and pearls is not going to bother about pebbles and stones.\nBut note – he does not renounce them, interest simply drops away.\n82\nLove.\nThought is man’s strength\nbut blind belief has robbed him of it,\nthat is why he has become weak and impotent. Think fully,\nthink tirelessly,\nfor amazingly enough the state of no-thought\nis achieved only at the peak of thought, it is the culmination of thought,\nand at this point all thought becomes useless. In this emptiness, truth lies.\n83\nLove.\nAll crutches bar the way.\nShun all support and then you will receive His. He is the only help for the helpless.\nThere is no other guide but Him – all other guides are obstacles on the path.\nIf you want to reach the Master avoid all teachers.\nDon’t be afraid to make yourself empty for that alone is the door,\nthat alone is the path –\nand that alone is the destination.\nThe courage to be empty\nis all that is needed to become one with the all. Those who are full stay empty,\nand those who are empty become filled – such are His mathematics.\nDo not consider doing anything – through doing you can never reach Him, nor through chanting,\nnor through austerity, for He is already here! Stop and see!\nTo do is to run, not to do is to halt.\nYes! If He were far away we could run to meet Him, but He is the nearest of the near!\nIf we had lost Him we could search for and find Him,\nhut to us He has never been lost! 84\nLove.\nI am glad to have received your letter.\nThe I is not to be given up because – how can you drop that which is not?\nThe I has to be looked into, understood.\nIt is like taking a lamp to search for darkness – the darkness vanishes!\nDarkness cannot be stamped out because it doesn’t exist.\nYou just have to bring a light and darkness is unmasked.\nIt is the same with your thoughts – do not fight with them; the effort to be free of thought comes\nitself from a thought.\nKnow your thoughts, watch them, be aware of them, then they quieten down without difficulty.\nWitnessing finally leads to emptiness and where there is emptiness – there is the ALL.\n85\nLove.\nWhy does man suffer so much?\nBecause in his life there is pandemonium but no soundless music,\nBecause in his life there is a babble of thoughts but no emptiness,\nbecause in his life there is a turmoil of feeling but no equanimity,\nbecause in his life there is a mad rushing around but no stillness which knows no directions,\nand finally because in his life there is much of himself\nbut of God, nothing at all. 86\nLove.\nThe time is ripe.\nThe hour draws nearer every day. Innumerable souls are restless.\nA path has to be created for them. So hurry!\nWork hard!\nSurrender totally!\nForget yourself!\nPlunge into God’s work like a madman; here, only madness will do –\nand there is no greater wisdom than such madness for God.\n87\nLove.\nNon-attachment is not concerned with things but with thoughts.\nNon-attachment is not related to the outside but to the within.\nNon-attachment is not to do with the world but with oneself.\nOne day a beggar went to see a Sufi fakir and found him seated on a velvet cushion inside a beautiful tent with its ropes tied to golden pegs.\nSeeing all this the beggar cried: What is this! Honourable Fakir, I have heard much about your spirituality and non-attachment, but I am completely disillusioned by all this ostentation around you.\nThe fakir laughed, replying :I am ready to leave all this behind and come with you.\nSo saying, he immediately got up and walked off\nwith the beggar not even waiting to put his sandals on! After a short while the beggar became distressed.\nI left my begging bowl in your tent, he said. What shall I do without it!\nPlease wait here while I go and fetch it. The Sufi laughed. My friend, he said,\nthe gold pegs of my tent were stuck in the earth not in my heart,\nbut your begging bowl is still chasing after you! To be in the world is not attachment.\nThe presence of the world in the mind is the attachment, and when the world disappears from the mind – this is non-attachment.\n88\nLove.\nOnce the ego is surrendered there is no suffering, no sorrow, for the ego is basically the cause of all suffering and the moment it is seen that everything is God there is no more cause for complaint.\nWhere complaining has ended, there is prayer. It is a feeling of gratitude, it is trust in God.\nIn this trust in God, benediction pours. Trust and know.\nIt is very difficult to trust but there is no austerity greater than accepting life as it is. 89\nLove.\nDo not look for results in meditation – this is an obstruction.\nDo not seek to repeat any meditative experience, for this too is a hindrance.\nWhen meditating, just meditate, the rest then happens by itself.\nThe way to God does not lie in our hands so leave yourself in His.\nSurrender, surrender, surrender! Remember always – surrender! Sleeping or waking – remember! Surrender is the only door to God.\nEmptiness is the only boat that sails to Him. 90\nLove.\nHow much longer will you go on letting your energy sleep?\nHow much longer are you going to stay oblivious\nof the immensity of your self. Don’t waste time in conflict, lose no time in doubt –\ntime can never be recovered and if you miss an opportunity,\nit may take many lives before another comes your way again.\n91\nLove.\nI received your letter.\nDo not fall into the whirl of calming the mind; this in itself is the restlessness.\nThe mind is what it is, accept it as such. This acceptance brings peace.\nRejection is restlessness, acceptance is peace – and he who reaches total acceptance attains to God. There is no other way than this.\nUnderstand this well because this understanding brings acceptance.\nAcceptance cannot come from an act of will – the action of will is itself non-accepting;\nI DO conceals non-acceptance because will is always of the ego.\nEgo cannot live unless fed by rejection.\nAcceptance can never be brought about by action, only understanding life can bring it about.\nLook, look at life. What is IS, it is as it is.\nThings are such – do not ask for them to be\notherwise because they cannot be even if you so desire. Desire is altogether impotent.\nAh, how can there he restlessness without desire? 92\nLove.\nSearch, search and search –\nso much that finally the seeker vanishes. There you meet Him.\nWhere the I is lost, there He is. There is not, and never has been, any wall between –\nexcept for the I.\n93\nLove.\nWhen the moon lifts into the sky watch it, be absorbed by it – forget everything else, including yourself!\nOnly then will you come to know the music that has no sound\nWhen the morning sun rises bow town to the earth ant lose yourself in homage to it.\nOnly then will you know of the music that is not made by man.\nWhen the trees burst into flowers, like a flower, dance with them in the breeze.\nOnly then will you hear the music that lives in one’s innermost self.\nHe who knows this music knows life too – its song is another word for God.\n94\nLove.\nDon’t float with the current of thoughts, just be aware of them.\nKnow that you are separate from them, distinct, distant, just an observer.\nJust watch the flow of thoughts like traffic, watch\nthan as you watch the dry leaves flying everywhere in the fall.\nDon’t be the one who makes them happy, don’t be the one to whom they happen.\nThen the rest takes place by itself. This rest is what I call meditation. 95\nLove.\nThis is a good beginning to the struggle and I am glad to have pushed you into it\nSannyas is a challenge to the world, a fundamental declaration of freedom.\nTo live in freedom every moment is sannyas. Now, insecurity will be with you always, but that is a fact of life.\nThe only certainty is death and life IS insecurity, and that is its joy and its beauty.\nTo be locked in security is suicide, a living death effected by one’s own hand.\nSuch living-dead are everywhere, they have turned the world into a graveyard, and they number amongst them many celebrated corpses.\nThey all have to be awakened. though for their part they are trying to put back to sleep even those who are awake.\nNow the struggle will go on and on In it your total resolution will be born.\nFar off I see your destination the other shore. 96\nLove.\nI was travelling, then on my return, there was your\nletter.\nYou can meet friends of Jeevan Jagruti Kendra and begin working for Yuvak Kranti Dal (Revolutionary Youth Force).\nThere are no rules about it – there can never be rules in revolution.\nThere needs to be an awakening of understanding among youth with scientific studies replacing blind faith – this is all I wish for.\nDo meet me this time when I come to Indore Everything is fine.\nMy regards to everyone there. 97\nLove.\nMy work is only God’s work;\napart from this there is neither me nor mine. No other work exists apart from His.\nYou just live in God, that’s all, and the rest happens by itself.\nJesus sail: First seek ye the Kingdom of God, then all else will be added unto you.\nI say the same.\nBut the mind of man seeks all else first, so what is bound to happen, happens –\nnothing else is gained.\nand he even loses whatever he had. 98\nLove.\nThe fragrance of SANNYAS has to be spread around the world.\nReligions like goals\nhave imprisoned the flower of sannyas too within their great walls.\nHence the SANNYASIN has to say now:\nI belong to no religion – all religions are mine.\nIt was an awful mistake to tear sannyas away from the world.\nIt has become bloodless.\nAnd the world without sannyas has lost its life. A new bridge has to be built between the two.\nSannyas has to be given back its blood and the world, its soul.\nSannyas has to be returned to samsara, fearless and unattached,\nin the world yet not of it, in the crowds, yet alone!\nAnd the world has to be fetched to sannyas too, fearless and unattached.\nThen sannyas will be a real sannyas and not an escape from the world.\nIt will be sannyas and in the world,\nonly then can that bridge of gold be built joining the seen with the unseen,\nthe form with the formless. Commit yourself to this great work,\njoin in the building of this great bridge! 99\nLove.\nEven the impossible is not impossible if resolution\nis there, and even the possible becomes impossible if one lacks will.\nThe world we live in is our own creation.\nThe time gap between sowing and reaping creates confusion.\nBecause cause and effect are so separated the mind fails to understand what would otherwise be obvious. Nothing is fragmented or disconnected.\nThe missing links are always there if you look deeply.\nUnderstanding the life process opens the door to peace.\nThe light lies close by, waiting for the seeker.\n100\nLove.\nI am glad to receive your letter.\nYou have the strength within but you don’t know about it.\nTo find it you need a catalyst.\nThe day you realize all this you will laugh,\nbut until then I am prepared to be your catalyst.\nI am already laughing\nand just waiting for the day you can join in this cosmic laughter.\nSee! Krishna is laughing! Buddha is laughing! Listen! The earth and heaven are laughing!\nBut man is weeping for he doesn’t know what he is. What a joke! What a lark!\nEmperors go on begging and fish are thirsty in the ocean!\n101\nLove.\nExistence is a play of sun and shade of hope and despair\nof happiness and sorrow of life and death.\nSo existence is duality\na tension of opposite poles a music of contrary notes.\nTo know it\nto recognize it\nto experience it as such is to go beyond it.\nThis transcendence is the real sadhana, the real achievement.\nThe key to this transcendence is the witness state.\nBid goodbye to the doer, live in the witness state. Watch the drama,\ndon’t drown in it,\nrather be drowned in observing – then happiness and sorrow\nbirth and death remain just a play, they do not affect you they cannot affect you.\nAll error, all ignorance, comes from identification.\n102\nLove.\nI received your letter.\nIt is good to know that your mother’s death has made you consider your own.\nOne has to go through the very awareness of death to reach deathlessness.\nThe thrust of death goes deep\nbut cunningly the mind goes on evading it. Don’t evade it,\ndon’t console yourself –\nany kind of consolation is a suicide.\nLet yourself completely feel the wound of death: wake up and live with it!\nThis will be hard\nbut revolution always is. Death is,\nit is there always,\nbut we forget about it. Every day death is there, every moment.\n103\nLove.\nI received your letter. So many questions!\nTo answer them I would have to write a book\nbigger than the MAHABHARATA!\nBut even then you would not get your answers because some questions others can never answer – your answers lie deep within your own life.\nAnd some questions have no answers because they are wrong questions\nfor which no answers can be found.\nAs the search continues\nthese questions always gradually drop away. Then there are some questions which are right questions\nbut have no answers at all.\nThey have to be experienced deep within oneself. 104\nLove.\nDo not desire bliss\nbecause that desire gets in the way.\nLive life unchained to desire and without an eye on a goal. Live free!\nLive from moment to moment! And don’t be afraid, be free of fear because there is nothing to lose – and nothing to gain\n– and the moment you realize this the totality of life is attained.\nBut never approach the gates of life as a beggar, never go begging,\nfor those gates never open to beggars! 105\nLove.\nIt brings me happiness to bear witness to your new birth.\nYou have worked for it over many lives and now the boat flows rightly,\nI can rest assured about you. Once I made you a promise and this is now fulfilled.\nIt is your turn to fulfil your part of the promise; make sure you don’t miss the chance,\ntime is short\nand I may not be able to be with you again. Muster your whole will,\ntake the oars in your hands\nand begin the journey that is infinite.\nYou have wasted much time sitting on the banks; now the winds are favourable –\nthis I know,\nand that’s why I am pushing you off the banks so earnestly.\nGod’s grace is showering, be open to it and let it in. Dance it and drink it in!\nWith such nectar at hand will you still stay thirsty?\n106\nLove.\nWhat is sought totally is always attained. Thoughts, when concentrated,\nbecome things.\nAs the river finds the ocean,\nthirsty souls find the temple of God.\nBut the thirst must be intense and the work tireless\nand the waiting without end\nand the calling with the whole heart, and all this thirst, work, waiting, calling – are contained in one small word\nand that word is prayer.\nBut praying cannot be performed, it is not an act,\nyou can only be in it.\nIt is a feeling, it is the soul,\nit is a surrender of oneself without words or demands. Leave yourself to the unknown and accept whatever comes.\nWhatever God makes of you – accept it, and if He breaks you accept that too. just for dancing’s sake;\nsing for singing’s sake;\nthen the whole life becomes divine and only then becomes prayer.\nTo live so is to be free. 107\nLove.\nMy blessings on your new birth – sannyas is a new birth,\nin oneself, by oneself, of oneself. It is also a death,\nnot an ordinary death but the great death. It is the death of all that you were up until yesterday,\nand what you are now –\nthat too must keep dying every moment\nso that the new can be born and born and born again.\nNow you will not remain you even for a moment, you have to die and be reborn every moment – this is the only sadhana.\nLive like a river, not like a pond. The pond is a householder,\nthe river, a sannyasin.\n108\nLove.\nThe temple of God is open only to a dancing, singing, happy heart.\nA sad heart cannot enter there so avoid sadness;\nfill your heart with colour as vivid as a peacock – and for no reason.\nHe who has reason to be happy is not really happy. Dance and sing –\nnot for others, not for a reason,\njust for dancing’s sake; sing for singing’s sake;\nthen the whole life becomes divine\nand only then becomes prayer. To live so is to be free.\n109\nLove.\nI am glad to get your letter.\nThe moment of the inward revolution is near but first you have to go through the birth pangs. Nothing hurts more than this giving birth to oneself\nbut what comes after it is life’s greatest bliss. So, longing, waiting, prayer –\ntake these for your sadhana. Everything else is fine.\nMy regards to all.\n110\nLove.\nAs the birds sing each morning at sunrise, the heart fills with song at the dawn of meditation.\nAs flowers bloom in spring,\nthe soul is drenched in fragrance as meditation is born.\nAs everything glistens green beneath the rain, the consciousness shines with many colours as\nmeditation showers –\nall this and much more takes place, and this is only the beginning – ultimately everything goes; fragrance, colour, light, music – everything disappears,\nand an inner space, like the sky, appears – empty, formless, without quality.\nWait for that. Long for that.\nThe signs are good, so do not waste even a moment. Go on! I am always with you.\n111\nLove.\nThirst is good\nlonging is good an aching heart is good because He comes through the vale of tears.\nWeep so much\nthat only the tears remain, not you.\nIf the tears alone remain and he who weeps vanishes then God comes by Himself.\nThat is why I let you go, not stopping you. I knew you would regret it but this regret is good;\nI knew you would weep\nbut these tears have their usefulness –\ncan there be a profounder prayer than tears? 112\nLove.\nWhat is truth?\nThis much at least can be said:\nIt cannot be defined,\nso forget about all definitions,\ndrop all evaluations and interpretations – these are all mind games,\nall creatures of thought. What is, is beyond the mind.\nThoughts are as unaware of reality\nas the waves are of the peace of the lake.\nWith waves\nthe lake loses its tranquility; when the lake is calm\nthen the waves cannot exist. One has to know that-which-is\nIts interpretation is very different from knowing it. Interpretations take one astray,\nthey are as illusory as scarecrows.\nThe seeker of truth has to be wary of words.\nWords are not the truth, truth cannot be words. Truth is an experience, truth is reality,\nand the path to it is NETI, NETI – neither this nor that.\nDrop explanations, drop definitions,\ndrop scriptures and doctrines, remember neti, neti not this, not that! Then drop I and thou.\nand say neti, neti.\nWhat is left manifest in the emptiness – that is truth,\nand that alone is. All else is dream. 113\nLove.\nThe decision to take sannyas is propitious – and sadhana follows decision like a shadow. Seeds have to be sown in the mind as well, there too – as we sow we reap,\nTHE WAY has to be carved out of the mind too. The temple of God is close\nbut the mind is like a dense forest\nwe have to hack our way through to reach it. The first steps have to be taken from where you are,\neven for a long journey\nthe first steps have to be taken just close by, and in every journey,\nnot only that towards truth,\nthe beginning is not different from the end – they are two ends of the same span,\ntwo poles of the same entity.\nYet often you cannot guess from the first step where you will end up;\nthose first steps may seem quite unrelated to the last!\nCharles Catering recollects this interesting incident:\nOnce I bet a friend\nthat if I bought him a birdcage to hang in his sitting-room\nhe would have to buy a bird.\nThe friend laughed and said he could keep a cage without a bird –\nthere was nothing to it!\nHe accepted the bet\nand I bought him a beautiful cage from Switzerland which he hung in his sitting-room.\nNaturally, the inevitable happened – life has its own logic.\nWhosoever saw the cage immediately sympathized with him, asking:\nWhen did your bird die?\nHe would answer: I never had a bird.\nThen they would say: So why the empty cage?\nFinally he got sick and tired of explaining and went and bought a bird.\nWhen I asked him about it he said:\nIt was easier to buy the bird and lose the bet than to explain things to each and every one from morn till night.\nAnd also,\nseeing this empty cage hanging there day in and day out, my mind kept repeating: The bird! The bird! The bird!\nSo, if you hang commitment like a cage in the mind it won’t be long before the bird of sadhana comes! 114\nLove.\nMan lives not in reality but in dreams.\nEach mind creates a world of its own which exists nowhere.\nDuring the day as well as the night the mind is swamped in dreams.\nWhen the dreams become too much, too intense, insanity comes.\nTo be clear and healthy is to be without dreams. Once, the president of a country went to inspect the nation’s largest lunatic asylum.\nThe director took him to a room and told him:\nIn this room, the inmates suffer from car-phobia. The president, curious, looked through the window. But there is nobody there, he said.\nThey are all there, sir – under the beds repairing cars, the director replied.\nEveryone is lying under their dreams in the same way. If this president had looked within, what would he have found?\nIs not every capital a great madhouse?\nBut one cannot see one’s own madness – this is a sure trait of madness.\nWhen someone starts doubting himself, seeing his madness, know well that the time has come for his unsanity to go.\nAwareness of madness marks the end of madness. Awareness of ignorance heralds its end.\nAwareness of dreaming brings dreams to an end. What is left is truth.\n115\nLove.\nI am very glad to have received your letter. Anxieties in life exist but there is no need to worry about them.\nWorrying stems not from the anxieties but from our attitude towards them.\nTo be anxious or not is always our open choice. It is not that a non-anxious mind is free of anxieties – anxieties are there, they are an unavoidable part of life – but it does not burden itself with them.\nSuch a person always sees beyond them;\ndark nights surround him too but his eyes look to\nthe rising sun and therefore his soul is never drowned in darkness –\nand this alone is enough –\nthat the soul be not drowned in darkness. The body is bound to drown in it – in fact it already has.\nThose who are condemned to die live their lives in darkness; only the deathless have their lives rooted in the light.\nBlessings to the children and regards to all. 116\nLove.\nThere is no greater power than trusting oneself – its fragrance is not of this world;\npeace, bliss and truth flow from this fragrance.\nHe who trusts himself is in heaven and he who mistrusts himself holds the keys of hell in his hands.\nThe Scottish philosopher David Hume was an atheist, but every Sunday he made it a point\nto attend the sermon of John Brown, a confirmed theist.\nWhen people pointed out\nthat going to church was against his own principles he laughed – and replied: I have no faith whatever in what John Brown says,\nbut John Brown has total faith in what John Brown says.\nSo once a week I make a point of hearing a man who has total faith in himself!\nLove is also fire, but a cool fire.\nYet we have to burn in it because it also purifies; it burns only to purify.\nThe dross burns leaving pure gold.\nIn the same way my love will bring suffering\nbecause I wish to destroy you in order to recreate you. The seed must be broken –\nhow else can the tree be born? The river must end –\nhow else is it to merge with the ocean? So let go of yourself and die –\nhow else will you find the SELF? 117\nNote: Is missing...\n118\nLove.\nTruth is discovered not through swimming but through drowning.\nSwimming is a surface happening,\ndrowning takes you to the depths without end. 119\nLove.\nThe search for meaning is disastrous;\nit has brought nothing but meaninglessness.\nTo see that there is no meaning is to have the real meaning\nwhere meaninglessness cannot be, where meaning doesn’t matter\nand so its disasters are avoided. What remains just is and what is,\nis and what is not, is not and that’s all.\nYou ask for a clear statement about motivelessness. Your attempt to understand cannot succeed because it is motivated!\nWhy bother about understanding?\nLook, isn’t the thing clear there before you? All things are open!\nAll things are clear!\nBut man is so busy understanding no one is left to see what is clear, what is obvious, what is there! Confusion is the effort to understand.\nIgnorance is the effort to know.\nIf you don’t try to understand or know nothing can hide itself from you!\nTruth is always in front of you, naked, clear.\n120\nLove.\nYou say you feel broken.\nIt would be better if you broke down completely and disappeared.\nThat which is will always be the case\nand that which has become is bound to vanish. Becoming always leads to dissolution so do not try to save yourself.\nOne who loses himself goes beyond life and death, and he who saves himself is lost.\nYou are busy saving yourself\nand that is why you are afraid of breaking down. But what is there to save?\nAnd that which is worth saving is already saved. 121\nLove.\nYou long for the sun\nand you will get it for sure,\nbut you have to have the courage to burn! You can’t reach the light without dying, for ego is darkness,\nand besides, the sun isn’t anywhere outside but is born within when everything else there\nburns.\nWhen the self is alight – that is the light. The fear of dying is darkness,\nthe jump into death is the light. Die, and know this!\nDisappear, and you will find it. That is why I say love is prayer – it is the first lesson in death.\nRegards to all.\n122\nLove.\nDo not look for a purpose in life but live, and live totally.\nDo not be serious and grave but turn life into a dance.\nDance – like the waves on the sea! Blossom – like the flowers in spring! Sing – as the birds do continuously!\nAll without purpose, for no reason; then purpose is there, and all mystery is solved.\nThe famous physician Rocky Tonsky once asked a student:\nWhat is the purpose of life? What is its meaning? The student hesitated and stammered, as if trying\nto remember, then said: Yesterday I knew, but right now I seem to have forgotten.\nRocky Tonsky looked up at the sky and cried: God in heaven!\nThe only man who ever knew and now he has forgotten!\nLove to all the family. 123\nLove.\nYou ask for my ten commandments. This is very\ndifficult because I am against any sort of commandment. Yet just for the fun of it I set down what follows:\n1. Obey no orders except those from within.\n2. The only God is life itself.\n3. Truth is within, do not look for it elsewhere.\n4. Love is prayer.\n5. Emptiness is the door to truth, it is the means, the end and the achievement.\n6. Life is here and now.\n7. Live fully awake.\n8. Do not swim, float.\n9. Die each moment so that you are renewed each moment.\n10.Stop seeking. That which is, is: STOP AND SEE. 124\nLove.\nThe news of the commune delights me. The tree’s seed is sprouting,\nsoon innumerable souls will shelter under its branches.\nSoon the people for whom I have come will gather – and you are going to be their hostess!\nSo prepare yourself; that is,\nempty yourself completely\nbecause only emptiness can be the host.\nYou are already on your way singing, dancing, blissful\nlike a river flowing to the sea. I am delighted,\nand I am always with you. The ocean is close –\njust run, run, run!\n125\nLove.\nEverything changes except change, only change is eternal.\nBut the human mind lives in the past – and that is the confusion of all confusions.\nOne day the sky was filled with the clouds of\nwar –\nplane upon plane loaded with death. Beasts, birds, worms and beetles – all that could flee, fled.\nHorses, donkeys, rats, sheep, dogs and cats, wolves –\nall ran for their lives\nand the paths and tracks were full of them. As they fled, this multitude saw two vultures sitting on a wall by the road.\nBrothers! they cried to them. Flee! At once! Man is on the warpath again.\nThe vultures just smiled. They knew!\nOne said: Since time immemorial man’s wars have been good news for vultures.\nOur ancestors have said so, and so too our scriptures.\nIt is also our own experience.\nIn fact it is for the benefit of vultures that God sends man to war!\n– God has made man and war just for vultures!\nThis said, the two vultures flew off towards the battle –\nand in the next moment were blown to pieces by falling bombs. If they had only known how things can change over\nthousands of years\nBut does even man himself realize this? 126\nLove.\nI received your letter.\nDon’t be afraid of sexual desire because fear is the beginning of defeat. Accept it,\nit is and it has to be.\nOf course, you must know it and recognize it, be aware of it,\nbring it out of the unconscious into the conscious mind.\nYou cannot do this if you condemn it because condemnation leads to repression\nand it is repression that pushes desires and emotions into the unconscious.\nReally, it is because of repression\nthat the mind is divided into conscious and unconscious,\nand this division is at the root of all conflict, and it is this division that prevents man from being total –\nand without integration there is no way to peace,\nbliss and freedom. So meditate on sexual desire. Whenever the desire arises,\nwatch it mindfully. Do not resist it,\ndo not escape from it,\nencountering it leads you to unique experiences. And whatever you have learned or heard about celibacy –\nthrow it once and for all into the dustbin,\nfor there is no other way than this of reaching to brahmacharya.\nMy regards to all there. 127\nLove.\nBe like steel – clay will no longer do.\nTo be a sannyasin is to be a soldier of God. Serve your parents – even more than before, give them the joy of a sannyasin son,\nbut don’t relent,\nkeep your resolution firm,\nit will bring glory to your family.\nThe son who compromises with a thing like SANNYAS shames his family.\nI have complete trust in you,\nthat’s why I have been a witness to your SANNYAS. Laugh and go through everything.\nListen to everything and laugh. This is your sadhana.\nLet the storms come and go. 128\nLove.\nIn sannyas, samsara is just a drama; to know the world as a play is sannyas; then no one is small,\nno one great,\nno Ram and no enemy, Ravan,\nand everything is a ram-leela, God’s play. Whichever part you are given play it well; the part is not you\nand as long as we identify with our part in the play\nself-knowledge is impossible,\nand from the day that this identification is broken ignorance becomes impossible.\nPlay your part\nbut know well it isn’t you.\n129\nLove.\nI have received your letter.\nThere is a great difference between love and pity.\nThere is pity in love\nbut there is no love in pity;\ntherefore it is important to know things as they are: love as love, pity as pity.\nTo take one for the other\nis to create unnecessary worry. Ordinarily, love has become impossible because as he is man cannot be loving:\nto be in love the mind must be completely empty and we love only with our minds,\nso that when our love is at its lowest it is sex and at its highest it is compassion,\nbut love is a transcendence of both sex and compassion.\nTherefore understand what is\nand do not strive for what should be – what should be\nflows out of the acceptance and understanding of what is.\n130\nLove.\nI received your letter.\nNow never worry about me –\nnot even mistakenly! For two reasons – first: the day I surrendered myself for God I transcended all anxiety\nbecause trying to look after oneself is the only anxiety!\nEgo is anxiety.\nBeyond it: what anxiety? whose? and for whom? Secondly: men like me are born to be crucified;\nThe cross is our throne and our mission is fulfilled\nonly when stones are showered, not flowers.\nBut on the divine path\neven stones turn into flowers, and on the contrary path\neven flowers turn out to be stones.\nTherefore when the stones start raining on me, be happy and thank God!\nTruth is always received like this.\nIf you don’t agree ask Socrates\nask Jesus ask Buddha ask Kabir\nask Meera.\nMy regards to all.\n131\nLove.\nWhat does the seed know of its own potential? It is the same with man,\nhe doesn’t know what he is nor what he can be! The seed, perhaps, cannot look within but man can. This looking in is called meditation.\nTo know one’s truth as it is here and now is meditation.\nDive into it, deeper and deeper;\nthere, in the depths, all that is possible can be clearly seen,\nand once seen it begins to happen –\nthe awareness of what is possible turns it into a reality,\nlike a seed stirred by a vision of its potential beginning to sprout.\nTime, effort, energy – pour it all into meditation because meditation is the gateless gate through which\nthe self becomes aware of itself. 132\nLove.\nNothing in life is sure – except death, otherwise life is another name for insecurity.\nWhen this is realized\nthe desire for security simply vanishes;\nto accept insecurity is to become free of it.\nUncertainty will stay in the mind because that is its nature;\ndon’t worry about it\nbecause that will add fuel to it, just let the mind be, where it is, and you go into meditation.\nYou are not the mind\nso where is the problem of the mind?\nLeave the darkness where it is and just light your lamp.\nAre you going to think carefully and then surrender?\nO mad one! Surrender is a leap outside thought.\nEither jump or don’t jump\nbut for God’s sake don’t ponder about it! 133\nTheism is another name for infinite hope. It is patience,\nit is waiting,\nit is trust in leela, in the play of life,\nand therefore with theism complaining cannot be. Theism is acceptance,\nit is surrender –\nacceptance of what is beyond the self and surrender to the source of the self.\nIn 1914 a fire broke out in Thomas Edison’s laboratory.\nMachinery worth millions\nand all the papers pertaining to his lifelong research\nwere burnt to ashes.\nHearing of this tragedy his son Charles came looking for him\nand he found him standing by the side enjoying the sight of the leaping flames.\nOn seeing Charles, Edison said to him: Where is your mother?\nGo and find her and bring her here quickly; such a sight she will never see again!\nThe next day, walking amidst the ashes of his hopes and dreams,\nthe 67 year-old inventor said:\nWhat benefit there is in destruction!\nAll our mistakes have been burnt to ashes, thank God! Now we can begin afresh all over again!\nGod’s grace is endless.\nWe just require the eyes to see it. 134\nLove.\nWittgenstein has said somewhere:\nOf that which one cannot speak, one should remain silent.\nOh, if only this advice was heeded\nthere would be no useless arguments about truth! THAT-WHICH-IS cannot be spoken of.\nWhatever is said in words is not, cannot be,\nTHAT-WHICH-IS.\nTruth is beyond words,\nonly silence is related to truth. But silence is very difficult;\nthe mind wants to speak even of that which is beyond words.\nReally, the mind is the only barrier to silence. Silence belongs to the state of no-mind.\nA preacher came to address some small children. Before beginning he put a question to them:\nIf you were asked to address a gathering of such intelligent boys and girls\nwho expect a good lecture from you, and if you had nothing to speak on, what would you say?\nA small child replied: I would keep quiet. I would keep quiet.\nThis child-like simplicity is needed to experiment with silence.\n135\nLove.\nSANNYAS is a pilgrimage to Mt. Everest, naturally there are difficulties on the way. But the fruits of determination are sweet too, so bear everything calmly and joyously\nbut don’t give up your commitment.\nServe your mother even more than before – sannyas is not a running away from responsibility. Your family is not to be given up,\nrather do you have to make the whole world your family. Encourage your mother to take SANNYAS too,\ntell her: You have seen enough of the world,\nnow raise your eyes towards God.\nBut make sure she is caused no trouble on your account.\nThis doesn’t mean giving in or compromising – sannyas knows no compromise.\nStrong, bold and resolute is the soul of SANNYAS. 136\nLove.\nLove does not discriminate even in dreams,\nand in that love which is prayer too, there are no distinctions at all.\nNow I am no more.\nThe word I is simply a convenience and as such causes many difficulties. When the clouds of the I disappear nothing remains but love –\nlove without cause, unconditional love.\nHere I stand in the marketplace,\nwho is ready to come and take it from me?\nKABIR STANDS IN THE MARKETPLACE, TORCH IN HAND.\nIF YOU ARE READY TO BURN YOUR HOUSE DOWN, COME WITH ME. 137\nLove.\nAh, if the veena were outside you could hear its music,\nbut it is inside\nand we do not hear it.\nBut we can become one with it.\nAnd how much is music worth that ends with listening?\nFinally the musician, the veena, the music, the listener\nare not separate. Look inside,\ngo within,\nand see who is waiting there for you. 138\nLove.\nThe springs of meditation are close at hand\nbut the layers of suppressed sex work like rocks.\nThe repression of sex has choked your life with anger, its smoke pervades your whole personality.\nWhen you were meditating in front of me the other day I saw all this very clearly,\nbut I could also see that your will is very strong too, your thirst for God is also strong\nand you are working mightily,\nso there is no need to be disheartened. Difficulties are there,\nblocks are there,\nbut they will break up\nbecause the breaker is not yet broken. Meditate totally and soon the springs will be reached\nBut you have to put your whole being at stake – nothing less will do;\nhold back a bit and you will miss.\nTime is short so gather all your strength; whilst the opportunity is here\nyour effort must be total.\nIt is difficult to say whether you will have such an opportunity in another life,\nso everything must be finished in this one.\nIf the gates don’t open this time\nyou will have to start from the very beginning next time –\nand then it is far from sure that I will be with you.\nIn your last life you worked for it but the work was not completed;\nand it was the same in the life before that.\nFor three lives you have repeated the same cycle again and again –\nit is time now to break it. It is already late,\nany further delay would be foolish. My regards to all.\n139\nLove.\nThe meaning of sadhana\nis to enter into one’s own nature, to live in it,\nto be it.\none must therefore know what is not one’s nature so as to be aware of what one wants to be free of. Recognizing it becomes freedom from it.\nA disciple of Bankei asked him:\nI become overwhelmed by anger.\nI want to be rid of it but I cannot be. What shall I do?\nBankei did not say a word,\njust stared deep into the disciple’s eyes,\nwho began to sweat in those few heavy minutes of silence.\nHe wanted to break the silence but couldn’t gather\nthe courage.\nThen Bankei laughed ant said: It’s strange!\nI searched and searched but could find no anger within you.\nStill, show me a little of it, here and now. The disciple said: It is not always here.\nIt comes all of a sudden, how can I produce it now? Bankei laughed again and said:\nThen it is not your true nature.\nThat remains with you always\nand if your anger had been part of it you could have shown it to me.\nWhen you were born it was not with you, when you die it will not be with you.\nNo, this anger is not you. There is a mistake somewhere. Go away and think again, search again, meditate again. 140\nLove.\nGod purifies in every way.\nIt is not only gold that has to pass through fire to be purified\nbut man too.\nFor man this fire is the anguish of love.\nIt is a blessing when this fire enters a person’s life, it is the fruit of infinite prayers,\ninfinite births.\nIt is the intensity of thirst that turns finally into love,\nbut unfortunately few are able to welcome it because few can recognize love in the form of anguish.\nLove is not a throne, it is a cross; but those who gladly offer.\nthemselves to it attain the very highest throne. The cross can be seen, the throne cannot –\nit is always hidden behind the cross. And even Jesus hesitated for a moment;\neven his heart cried out: FATHER, WHY HAST THOU FORSAKEN ME?\nBut the next moment he remembered and said: THY WILL BE DONE.\nThat was enough:\nthe cross became a throne and death a new life.\nIn the moment of revolution between one statement and the next\nChrist descended into Jesus.\nYour suffering is intense and a new birth is at hand; be happy, be grateful,\ndon’t be afraid of death, be thankful,\nit is the tidings of a new birth\nand the old must die to give birth to the new; the seed must break to blossom into the flower. 141\nLove.\nWhat is suppressed becomes attractive, what is negated, invites!\nOnly alertness to the mind’s games brings freedom. Negation does not really negate,\non the contrary, it invites.\nThe mind plays around the forbidden\nlike the tongue around the gap of an extracted tooth.\nA small shopkeeper in London once caused a sensation.\nHe hung in his show window\na black curtain with a small hole at the centre; under the hole was written in large letters: PEEPING STRICTLY FORBIDDEN.\nNaturally, it brought the traffic to a standstill!\nCrowds gathered around the shop\njostling one another for a peep through the curtain.\nThere they saw nothing but a few towels – it was just a small towel shop\nand the shopkeeper had devised this sure-fire method of increasing his sales.\nIt worked like magic.\nMan’s mind works the same way and he becomes trapped by it.\nTherefore – always be wary of negation, opposition, suppression .\n142\nLove and blessings. Live the truth,\nfor there is no other way to find it. Become the truth,\nfor there is no other way to know it. You cannot know truth through words, not through the scriptures,\nnor through learning, study, contemplation. Truth is within, in the emptiness within.\nIn the state of no-mind,\nin the mind free of desires where only awareness is, there truth manifests itself.\nTruth simply is,\nit has not to be found, simply uncovered.\nThe lid of gold covering it is the ego. Ego is darkness;\ndie, and become light!\nWhere the darkness of the ego is no more there, in that emptiness, truth is;\nand that is truth, and that is bliss,\nand that is immortality. Do not seek it,\njust die and it is there. 143\nLove.\nI am glad to receive your letter.\nYes, this much suffering has to be gone through – it is the birth pangs of our own rebirth.\nAnd going back is not possible\nfor where is the past to which to return?\nTime demolishes the steps we climb to reach the present.\nThere is no going back –\nonly going forward is possible – forward and forward –\nand the journey is endless! There is no goal, no destination, only resting places –\nwhere the tents are dismantled as soon as they are pitched.\nBut why this fear of anarchy? All systems are false –\nlife is anarchic, insecure;\nhe who seeks security dies before his death. Why this hurry to die?\nDeath itself will take care of that for us so is it not proper that we learn to live?\nAnd the miracle is\nthat death does not call on the one who learns how to live –\nand this alone is needed:\ndoesn’t the gardener silently wait after sowing the seed?\nWhenever you need me you will find me beside you. Regards to all there.\n144\nLove.\nAtheism is the first step towards theism, and a must.\nIf you haven’t been through the fire of atheism you’ll never know the light of theism.\nIf you haven’t the true strength to say No your Yes will always be impotent,\nsol am glad you are an atheist –\nsomething that can be said only by a theist. So I say: Go deeper into atheism.\nSuperficiality won’t do,\nso don’t just think atheism, live it – and it will ultimately lead you to God. Atheism isnt IT.\nit is just a doubting.\nDoubt is good but it isn’t IT. Actually, doubt is a search for trust.\nSo go on, take your journey\nfor the path to truth starts with this doubt.\nDoubt is sadhana\nbecause doubt eventually exposes the incontestable truth.\nInside the seed of doubt is the tree of trust so if you plant the seed of questioning\nand work on it\nyou are bound to harvest trust. And beware all religions!\nOnly religions obstruct the true path of RELIGION. 145\nLove.\nDreams too are true\nbecause what we call truth is only a dream –\nit is just the difference between open and closed eyes.\nUnderstand this fully\nand then one can go beyond both, and the way lies beyond both.\nBoth are the seen and beyond both is the seer. 146\nLove.\nNot only is a seed a seed man is also a seed.\nNot only seeds bloom man also blooms.\nNot only seeds blossom into flowers 147\nHow can the search begin unless there is doubt?\nHow will the heart stir to know the truth unless there is doubt?\nRemember –\nbelief and faith bind man, doubt liberates him.\n148\nLove.\nI was glad to receive your letter. Make love your prayer now.\nLove alone is worship, is God.\nLet there be love with every breath this is your only sadhana.\nSitting, rising, sleeping, waking just remember: LOVE.\nThen you will see that His temple is not far off. 149\nLove.\nGod is testing you every moment. Laugh and take the test –\nit is beautiful that he considers you worth testing!\nBut don’t be in a hurry\nfor the more you hurry the more some goals recede, and without doubt the temple of God is a goal like that\nHe who travels with patience travels fastest on this journey. The mind will roam again and again – that is its way;\nthe day its roaming stops it will be dead. Sometimes it sleeps –\ndo not mistake this for death:\nsometimes it gets tired –\ndon’t mistake this for death either:\nsome rest and sleep and it is strong and alive again.\nSo stop bothering about it altogether for even this worry gives it strength. Surrender even this to God.\nSay to Him: Whatever it’s like, good or bad, take care of it –\nand then just be a witness, simply watch the whole play.\nWatch the play of the mind with detachment and then suddenly –\nthere is the consciousness which is no-mind. 150\nLove.\nGod is far off\nbecause we don’t know how to see Him close by. Actually there is nothing closer than Him.\nmore than that – He is the here and now.\nThe name God is just for those who can’t find the here and now.\nWords, names, doctrines, scriptures, religion, philosophy –\nall these are created for those who can see Him only at a distance.\nHence they have no connection with God but only with those who are blind to the near. That’s why I say,: Drop the distant.\nDrop paradises in the sky. Drop salvations in the future.\nand see the near in time and in space. Be here and now and see!\nSee the instant in time. see the atom in space.\nIn the time moment time ceases to exist. In the space atom space ceases to exist. I here is no space, no time, here and now. What is left is truth,\nis God, is that.\nYou too are that.\nTAT TWAM ASI – that art thou. 151\nLove.\nThe word is not the thing.\nthe word God is not God,\nbut the mind goes on accumulating words and words and words,\nand then the words become the barrier. See this as a fact with you:\ncan you see anything without the word can you feel anything without the word.\ncan you live even for a single moment without the word? Do not think but see.\nand then you will be in meditation.\nTo exist wordlessly is to be in meditation. 152\nLove.\nAlways see WHAT IS. The facts.\nTHAT WHICH IS.\nDo not project anything, do not interpret,\ndo not impose any meaning\nthat is, do not allow your mind to interfere – and you will begin to encounter reality.\nOtherwise everyone lives in his own world of dreaming.\nAnd meditation is coming out of these worlds,\nthese dreaming patterns.\nA philosopher stopped Mulla Nasrudin on the street.\nIn order to test whether the Mulla\nwas sensitive to philosophical knowledge he made a sign, pointing at the sky.\nThe philosopher meant: There is only one truth, which covers all.\nNasrudin’s companion, an ordinary man, thought: The philosopher is mad.\nI wonder what precautions Nasrudin will take. Nasrudin looked in his knapsack and took out a coil of rope.\nThis he handed to his companion. Excellent, thought the companion.\nWe will bind him up if he becomes violent. The philosopher saw that Nasrudin meant:\nOrdinary humanity tries to find truth by methods as unsuitable as attempting to climb into the sky with a rope.\nNow can you remain content with the fact\nof Mulla Nasrudin giving the rope to his companion without any interpretation whatsoever?\nRemain with the fact, and you will be in meditation.\n153\nThe ego is necessary\nfor both the sensation of pain and the feeling of pleasure:\nand vice versa also –\nthe sensation of pain and the feeling of pleasure are necessary for the existence of the ego.\nIn fact these are two sides of the same coin. The name of the coin is ignorance.\nUnderstand this\nand do not fight with the ego or with pain and pleasure\nbecause unless ignorance is gone they will not go, they cannot go, and you cannot fight with ignorance\nbecause ignorance is just absence of something – absence of yourself.\nSo be present to your ignorance, be aware of it,\nand then you will be and there will be no ignorance because you and ignorance cannot exist simultaneously,\nas with light and darkness. 154\nLove.\nA small boy\nwith a penny clutched tightly in his hot little hand entered the toyshop\nand drove the proprietor to distraction asking him to show this and that\nand everything\nwithout ever making up his mind.\nLook here, my boy, said the storekeeper finally. What do you want to buy for a penny –\nthe whole world with a fence around it?\nThe boy thought for a moment and then replied: Let us see it.\nAnd I say to you that ordinarily\nno one is different from that small boy in this world.\nBut unless one is different, one is not mature. And maturity does not come with age alone, maturity comes through understanding the distinction\nbetween that which is possible and that which is not possible. 155\nLove.\nThings go on changing without. You must mirror them,\nyou must reflect them,\nbut remember always that the mirror remains the same. Mirroring does not change the mirror.\nDo not be identified with mirroring. Remember yourself as the mirror – that is what is meant by witnessing. And witnessing is meditation.\nLieh-Tzu exhibited his skill in archery to Po-Hun Wu-Jen.\nWhen the bow was drawn to its full length a cup of water was placed on his elbow and he began to shoot.\nAs soon as the first arrow was let fly\na second one was already on the string and a third followed.\nIn the meantime he stood unmoved like a statue.\nPo-Hun Wu-Jen said: The technique of your shooting is fine, but it is still a technique.\nYou look only like a statue from without.\nNow let us go up to a high mountain\nand stand on a rock projecting over a precipice and then you try to shoot.\nThey climbed up a mountain.\nStanding on a rock projecting over a precipice ten thousand feet high\nPo-Hun Wu-Jen stepped backward\nuntil one third of his feet were hanging over the rock. He then motioned to Lieh-Tzu to come forward.\nLieh-Tzu fell to the ground\nwith perspiration flowing down to his heels. Po-Hun Wu-Jen said:\nThe perfect man soars up above the blue sky or dives down to the yellow springs,\nor wanders about all over the eight limits of the world,\nyet shows no signs of change in his spirit.\nBut you betray a sign of trepidation and your eyes are dazed.\nHOW CAN YOU EXPECT TO HIT THE TARGET? 156\nLove.\nDo you want to ask questions? Or do you want to get answers?\nBecause if you want to ask questions then you will not get answers,\nand if you want to get answers\nthen you cannot be allowed to ask questions – because the answer is in that consciousness where the questions have not yet been raised, or have been uprooted and thrown out.\n157\nLove.\nI hope you will be moving in deep meditation.\nBreathe in it sleep in it live in it –\nlet meditation be your very existence. Only then is the happening.\nDon’t do it, but be it –\nAnd my blessings are always with you.\nIf you need any help from me just ask when you are thoughtLESS,\nand it will be given to yon. 158\nLove.\nA madman entered the bazaar and declaimed: The moon is more useful than the sun.\nBut why? asked someone.\nWe need the light more\nduring the night than during the day, he said.\nAnd I say to you that\nall our metaphysical theories and explanations are not of more worth than the explanation of that madman.\n159\nLove.\nAsk for nothing and you will never be frustrated. Anticipate darkness with light and sorrow with happiness because such is the nature of things.\nThen you will never be frustrated.\nSay to life: What can you do to me? I want nothing! And say to death: What can you do to me? I have already died!\nThen you will be truly free\nbecause unless one is free of life one can never be free of death.\nAnd when one is free of both\none knows that life which is eternity itself. 160\nLove.\nMan is an everlack,\nbecause he desires without knowing himself, because he desires to become something without knowing his being,\nand this is absurd.\nFirst one must know his being otherwise there will be anguish.\nBecoming is anguish\nbecause it is a constant tension\nbetween that which is and that which should be – and it is an impossible longing also\nbecause only that can be which is. So know yourself as you are without any ideals,\nwithout any judgement\nand without any condemnation.\nGo deep within yourself without any desires to become because only then can you know yourself.\nDiscover yourself,\nnot according to anybody else, but as you are.\nDiscover the fact, discover the real\nin its total nakedness. In this total authenticity just be a witness,\nand then there is an altogether different quality to life, the quality of let go.\nThen one is relaxed totally.\nAnd all flowering is in relaxation, and all benediction.\n161\nLove.\nFear cripples consciousness,\nand fear is the source of unconsciousness, that is why without transcending fear\nno one can attain to full consciousness. But what is fear?\nFear is awareness of death without knowing what death is.\nFear exists in the gap between you and your death, and if there is no gap, no space,\nthen there is no fear.\nDo not think of death as something outside you because it is not.\nAnd do not think of death as something in the future\nbecause it is not.\nDeath is within you,\nbecause death is the other side of life. Life cannot exist without death;\nthey both belong to the same energy as positive and\nnegative poles.\nSo do not identify yourself with life – because you are both.\nThe identification with life creates the gap. And death has nothing to do with the future – it is always here and now.\nEvery moment, it is.\nAnd when one ceases to regard it as something outside oneself\nand, so to speak, draws it into his consciousness and assimilates the idea of it,\none is completely changed. He is in all truth born again. And then there is no fear because then there is no gap. 162\nThinking is necessary but not enough, one must know living also,\notherwise one becomes like the philosopher mentioned by Soren Kierkegaard\nwho builds a fine palace\nbut is doomed not to live in it – he has a shed for himself\nnext door to what he has constructed for others,\nincluding himself, to look at!\nMeditation is not thinking, but living Live it daily, moment to moment; that is, live in it or let it live in you.\nIt is not something other-worldly either, because all such distinctions are from the mind: they are speculative and not existential,\nand meditation is existential.\nIt is no more than one’s everyday life lived totally. When Mencius says: The truth is near and people seek it far away,\nhe means this.\nWhen Tokusan is asked about it he replies: When you are hungry you eat,\nwhen you are thirsty you drink,\nand when you meet a friend you greet him. He means this.\nSings Ho Koji: How wondrous this, how mysterious! I carry fuel, I draw water.\nHe also means this.\nAnd when you are near me\nwhatsoever I may say I always mean this. Or I may not say anything –\nbut then too I always mean this. 163\nLove.\nReligion is so much an experience\nthat it cannot be handed over by one to another. But there are traditions of religious experience – which are bound to be false\nbecause of the very nature of the religious experience.\nOne has to travel the path alone\nwith no footprints of other travellers even to guide.\nHasan of Basra was asked: What is Islam and who are the Muslims?\nHe is reported to have said:\nIslam is in the books\nand Muslims? Muslims are in the tombs. 164\nLove.\nThe world itself is a punishment enough, so really there is no need for hell at all.\nOnce a man who had married three wives was brought before the king of the country for punishment.\nThe king called in his counsellors and asked them to devise\nthe worst possible punishment for the offender, even death itself.\nBut they did not order his execution,\nruling instead that it would be still worse for him to live with all three wives at the same time.\nTwo weeks later the man committed suicide. 165\nLove.\nI have no special doctrine or philosophy, no set of concepts or intellectual formulas, but only certain irrational devices\nthrough which I can push you into the unknown.\nI do not believe in any theories or any systems of thought,\nbut I have faith in certain existential situations through which I can throw you into the unknown. Intellectual understanding is not understanding at all but only a deception.\nUnderstanding is always of the total, of the whole being.\nIntellect is only a part, and that too a minor one, but it plays as the whole\nand thereby creates all sorts of stupidities. Do not be identified with your intellect.\nDissolve it into the whole of your being,\nand then you will know what understanding is – and the bliss and the ecstasy that follow it inevitably.\n166\nLove.\nMeditation is a mirror – and the most faithful one.\nWhoever goes into meditation risks a confrontation with himself:\nThe mirror of meditation never lies, and it does not flatter.\nIt is impartial and innocent and it never projects anything.\nIt only faithfully shows your real original face, the face we never show to the world,\nthe face that we ourselves have forgotten.\nSo it is possible that you yourself\nmay not be able to recognize it the first time! But do not escape from it.\nFace it and you will come to know it and recognize it.\nThis confrontation is the first test of courage on the inner way.\nSo when it comes to happen – rejoice and feel blessed.\n167\nLove.\nYes, there is tension.\nTo be consciously conscious is to be tense, but it is not because of consciousness\nbut because of partial consciousness.\nThe unconscious is always behind the so called consciousness –\nthis situation creates tension because this creates a dichotomy, a duality;\nhence the tension,\nbecause the being is divided – which cannot be divided.\nHence the tension,\nThe unnaturality of the situation is the root cause of this tension,\nand for that matter of all tensions, because then one is not individual, that is, indivisible;\ntherefore there is tension,\nand one cannot really relax unless one is ONE. Either be totally unconscious as in deep and dreamless sleep –\nand then there is no tension, or be totally conscious –\nand then you are in the state of no-tension because the total can never be tense.\nThat is why the whole is the holy.\nBut falling into deep sleeplike trance is just escaping the problem,\nand that too only for the time being, because you will be back soon – and worse,\nbecause by such escapes\nthe gap between the conscious and the unconscious is not bridged\nbut, on the contrary, widened even more. One becomes split and schizophrenic.\nSo always be aware of the mind\nbecause it tries to find solace in unconscious states in so many ways –\nthrough chemical drugs, through auto-hypnotic means,\nand otherwise.\nBegin to be aware of anything\nwhich ordinarily happens unconsciously, for example – anger, jealousy, pride –\nand your consciousness will be deepened. Act consciously,\neven in day-to-day acts be conscious, for example – walking, eating, talking –\nand your consciousness will be expanded. Be alert when thinking.\nNo thought should be allowed to pass unwitnessed.\nAnd then, in the end, there is explosion in which you become totally conscious with no unconsciousness behind.\nWhen this happens one is one, and to be one is to be silent.\nThis silence is beyond time and space, because it is beyond duality.\n168\nLove.\nGod is when you are not.\nWhen you are IT IS not\nbecause YOU are nothing but a blindness. The ego cannot see.\nthe ego cannot be aware,\nthe ego exists only as a by-product of unconscious living. One goes on living as if in sleep.\nIn this sleep the part begins to dream itself as the whole,\nand this dreaming becomes a barrier to knowing the whole. Begin to be aware,\naware of your actions, thoughts and emotions, just aware.\nBecause if you condemn or appreciate you will not be aware –\nin any choice the awareness is contaminated and the darkness of unawareness comes in, so just be aware without any choice;\nthen awareness is pure and innocent, and then awareness is a mirror.\nIn this mirror-like awareness one never finds oneself but one finds THAT-WHICH-IS.\nAnd that is God.\nBut it is only when you are not\nbecause you are the dust which makes the mirror blind. Because you are the blindness.\n169\nLove.\nThere are three forms of knowledge. The first is intellectual knowledge,\nwhich is in fact not knowledge but information only, and the collection of facts and the use of these\nto arrive at further intellectual concepts. The second is emotional knowledge which also is really not knowledge\nbut feeling of the mental states in which man feels he has known something,\nbut there is no transformation or mutation of his being.\nThe first is objective and out of it science is born,\nand the second is subjective and is the source of all art. The third is neither;\nit is beyond both,\nand this third is the real.\nIt is achieved through meditation\nbecause meditation does not use thinking and feeling as doors of perception –\nreally these are not doors of perception but forces of projection;\nthrough them pure knowing is impossible, whatsoever comes through them is changed and coloured by them.\nSo unless one is free from all projections one cannot know THAT-WHICH-IS.\nWhen there are no ripples of thought and emotion in the consciousness, then and only then\ndawns the third form of knowledge,\nand this third is the only real knowledge. Out of it religion is born,\nand out of it is total transformation. 170\nLove.\nThe journey is long\nand the path is pathless – and one has to be alone.\nThere is no map and no one to guide. But there is no alternative\nOne cannot escape it, one cannot evade it.\nOne has to go on the journey.\nThe goal seems impossible\nbut the urge to go on it is intrinsic. THE NEED IS DEEP IN THE SOUL.\nReally, you are the urge, you are the need – and consciousness cannot be otherwise because of this challenge\nand because of this adventure. So do not waste time – begin. Do not calculate – begin.\nDo not hesitate – begin. Do not look back – begin.\nAnd always remember old Lao Tzu’s words: A tree that takes both arms to encircle grows from a tiny rootlet.\nA many-storied pagoda\nis built by placing one brick upon another brick. A journey of three thousand miles is begun by a single step.\n171\nLove.\nWhen I say mutation I do not mean simply change. Change is from the known to the known:\na sinner becomes a saint –\nthen it is change and not mutation.\nYou can practise change but you cannot practise mutation because only the known can be practised –\nand then any change is going to be only a modified past because the past will be continuous in it,\nand the past also will be the master of it because it is cultivated by the past.\nIn other words, change is from this to that, it is a movement in the known.\nBut mutation is explosion:\nfrom THIS to nothingness, from here to nowhere.\nYou cannot practise it –\non the contrary, you are the only hindrance. So what is to be done.\nReally nothing can be done. Be aware of this helplessness,\nand remain in this helplessness.\nDo not do anything because any doing\nwill be escaping from this fact of helplessness. Do not move at all –\nand then there is explosion, and then there is mutation. 172\nLove.\nReligion is not a promise for the future but an experience HERE AND NOW. But through priesthood it has become promises and promises and promises. At an examination of a class in First Aid\na member, who was also a priest, was asked: What would you do if you found a man in a fainting condition?\nI would give him some brandy, was the answer. And if there was no brandy? he was then asked. I would promise him some, replied the priest.\n173\nLove.\nWherever there are words there is no real meaning. But here also are words?\nThen what to do?\nREAD BETWEEN THE WORDS.\nOr read that which is said but not written, or that which is shown and not even said, or that which is meant and not even shown. That is – LOOK IN,\nbecause the words are without but the meaning is within.\n174\nLove.\nReason is not enough;\nit is necessary but not enough.\nThe beyond must be remembered – and always, because reason in itself is destructive;\nalone, it is nothing but a cutting weapon. It creates a man anti-all and pro-nothing.\nIt creates absolutely negative minds which can criticize but cannot create,\nbecause reason has no healing force within itself; it is only a tiny part and not the whole of life\namd the healing force is always with the whole. 175\nLove.\nWith thought the mind has boundaries\nbut without thought the mind is just infinite space.\nThat is why in thoughtless awareness one stops being a drop\nand becomes oceanic.\nAnd then there is great energy.\nThis energy wipes out everything which is dead. It wipes out the whole karmic past –\nand with no effort at all.\nThe greater absorbs the lesser and remains untouched.\n176\nLove.\nThe will to wholeness is inherent in everything,\nbut only in man has it become conscious. Therefore man lives in tension,\nand only when this longing is fulfilled\nis his negative state of tension wiped out.\nThe tension is symbolic of the infinite potential and also of the infinite possibilities.\nMan is not what he can be,\nand unless he is that which he can be he cannot be at ease.\nThis dis-ease is man,\nand health is in wholeness.\nThe fact that language has one root for the words whole, holy and to heal conceals a deep truth:\nHe who is whole is also healed, and to be healed is to be whole.\nThis wholeness can only be achieved\nby becoming totally conscious of oneself:\nThe darkness of the unconscious is to be penetrated and transformed into light.\nAnd meditation is the method. 177\nLove.\nThe new world revealed in meditation\nis not something added from the outside. It has always been there – within,\nis in being itself. It IS being itself.\nOne may know it or not, but it is THERE – as a seed of course, as a potentiality,\none has to make it actual, that is all. That is why when it is revealed, when it flowers,\none laughs uproariously\nbecause it has always been there and one never knew it. To work towards meditation is just like sculpturing because just as the sculptor chisels out a figure\ndeeply buried in a mass of inert matter. so the meditator transforms his won inert potentialities.\ninto living, dynamic and conscious creations. of course, here\nthe creator and the creation and the means of creation are not different but one\nbecause the meditator himself is all.\nAnd that is why I call meditation the greatest art. 178\nLove.\nDo not think of others and waste your time;\nreally, that is a subtle and cunning way of the mind to escape from itself.\nOnce a monk asked Ummon:\nSir, you always say that Buddhism helps us in every possible way,\nbut how can it help the blind, the deaf or the dumb? The blind cannot see the teacher’s staff that is raised before them,\nthe deaf cannot hear the teacher’s words, no matter how wise,\nthe dumb cannot ask their questions or speak their understanding:\nso since we cannot help these people\nhow can we say that Buddhism helps in every possible way?\nWhat good is it?\nUmmon just remained silent for a while\nand then abruptly poked at the questioner with his stick. The monk of course jumped back.\nAh! said Ummon. I see you are not blind!\nThen he told the monk to come forward, which he did. Ah-ha! said Ummon. I see you are not deaf!\nThen he asked the monk\nif he understood what all this to-do was about. The monk said he did not.\nAh-ha! said Ummon. I see you are not dumb! 179\nLove.\nMeditation does not require any application of the mind or use of effort.\nIt descends upon you as effortlessly as sleep. You cannot try to sleep,\nnor can you try to meditate. On the contrary,\nevery effort hinders its smooth and silent coming. There is no place in it for action or aggression – and action is ways aggressive.\nMeditation is passive receptivity. Mind is aggressive,\nmeditation is passive.\nBe passive nd receptive and open\nand vulnerable and WAIT.\nThe real miracle happens through waiting. The moment that waiting is total\nthere is happening,\nand – THE EXPLOSION. 180\nLove.\nThe problem of life is not philosophical, it is existential.\nYou cannot solve it from the outside; you cannot just be a spectator to it – you are in it – you ARE IT.\nAnd moreover, what is philosophy?\nAt the worst a linguistic misunderstanding, or at best a linguistic analysis.\nAnd even at its best it leads nowhere because the problem is existential\nand it cannot be solved through language analysis and grammar.\nOne dark night a dervish was passing a dry well when he heard a cry for help from below.\nWhat is the matter? he called down. I am a grammarian,\nand I have unfortunately fallen,\ndue to my ignorance of the path, into this deep well,\nin which I am now all but immobilized, responded the other. Hold, friend, and I’ll fetch a ladder and a rope,\nsaid the dervish.\nOne moment please! said the grammarian. Your grammar and diction are faulty.\nBe good enough to amend them.\nIf that is so much more important than the essentials, shouted the dervish, you had best stay where you are until I have learned to speak properly.\nAnd he went his way. 181\nLove.\ndon’t think about surrender at all\nbecause that which thinks about it is the only barrier,\nand therefore no one can surrender: it is not a doing at all.\nIt happens,\nyou cannot go to it, it comes to you.\nAnd any effort on your part will hinder its coming. Be open and effortless, relaxed and passive,\nand it will come – it always comes I am a witness to it.\n182\nLove.\nMulla Nasrudin was searching for something on the ground. What have you lost, Mulla? someone who saw him searching, asked. My key, said the Mulla. So they both went down on their knees and looked for it. After a\ntime the other man asked: Where exactly did you drop it? In my house, said the Mulla.\nThen why are you looking here?\nThere is more light here than inside my house.\nI ask you also – where are you looking for the key? Inside the house?\nOr out there, where there is more light? 183\nLove.\nThere is no end to man’s self-deception, because whatsoever he is going to do he can rationalize it.\nOne day one man boasted in the bar that he is a man of iron WILL,\nand now he will show it\nby not touching wine again in his life. But not even that day could pass.\nIn the evening he came to the bar and said loudly for all to hear –\nI am stronger than my willpower.\nI fought the whole day and finally conquered my\ndamn willpower!\nA double scotch, please!\n184\nLove.\nThe way of meditation is above the self; its base is surrendering.\nSurrender the self to your own no-self; Be as if you are not.\nOh, the benediction\nwhen one just leaves everything to the no-self!\nBuddha called this phenomenon anatma or anatta (no-selfhood).\nOne must turn oneself into a puppet in the hands of the no-self,\nand then everything begins to flow naturally and spontaneously\njust like a river flowing to the sea\nor like a cloud wandering in the sky. Lao-tzu says this is doing by non-doing.\nOne ceases to be one’s own master\nand becomes an instrument of the unknown – and what nonsense it is to be one’s own master because there is no one to be so!\nDo not search and you will continue to believe in it. Search and it is nowhere to be found.\nThe self exists only in ignorance. It IS ignorance.\nIn knowing there is nos elf because there is no knower.\nThen knowing is enough unto itself. 185\nLove.\nThere is conflict in the mind – always,\nbecause the mind cannot exist without the conflict. It gets strengthened through conflict;\neven warring against conflict is conflict\nand struggling to go beyond the mind is mind.\nSee this deeply and immediately without motive,\njust as if you have come across a snake in the street – and the jump.\nThen it is not that you jump but – the jump.\nThe jump happens spontaneously without effort\nand without conflict.\nWhen this happens there is no-mind and no-mind is the door to the divine.\n186\nLove.\nIn meditation, enjoy doing nothing.\nBe in a state of perfectly quiet passivity – then you are in harmony with the world.\nThe thought-forms dissolve automatically because they cannot exist with total passivity: they are forms of an activity-addicted mind, and with them dissolves the ego –\nbecause it cannot exist without thought-forms.\nThe ego is nothing but\na whirlpool centre of constantly revolving thought-forms.\nRemain in passivity,\nthat is, in the state of absolute doing-nothingness,\nand meditation deepens to the depths where there is no meditator;\nand remember that only when there is no meditator has meditation really come into being.\nIf you are then there is no meditation, and when there is meditation you are not. 187\nIt is tragic but true that few people ever possess\ntheir souls.\nThey possess everything except themselves, and then naturally they just become a thing among their other things.\nThe possessor becomes the possessed. Nothing is more rare in any man, says Emerson, than an act of his own.\nBut this is just what can be expected because no one is one’s own,\nno one is oneself.\nMost people are other people.\nThey are not living\nbut only acting roles given to them by others. Their thoughts are someone else’s opinions and their faces are just masks.\nThey are faceless.\nThey have no authentic being at all.\nTheir lives – a mimicry\nand their passions – a quotation.\nBreak this vicious circle otherwise you will never BE.\nBreak this through meditation –\nand it cannot be broken by anything else because through mind it cannot be broken,\nand except for meditation, all else is mind. Mind is the prison,\nmeditation, the door. And the only door.\n188\nLove.\nOnly God is –\nthat is why it is so difficult to find Him, and God is everywhere –\nthat is why He seems to be nowhere, and the seeker is the sought –\nthat is why all seeking is so futile. Stop and see.\nBut the mind is running constantly. Do not be, and see.\nBut the mind is trying to be continuously. Says Auden:\nFor the garden is the only place there is, but you will not find it.\nUntil you have looked for it everywhere and found nowhere that is not a desert; The miracle is the only thing that happens, but to you it will not be apparent,\nUntil all events have been studied\nand nothing happens that you cannot explain; And life is the destiny you are bound to refuse until you have consented to die.\nSTOP AND SEE.\nDO NOT BE, AND SEE.\n189\nLove.\nLive in the body intimately and deeply.\nFeel the body more and let the body feel more.\nIt is astonishing how many people\nare almost completely unaware of themselves physically. The body is suppressed and denied life too much,\nthat is why it is just a dead weight and not a living joy.\nThat is why I insist: be back in the body\nand regain the wonderful joy in its movements, sheer movements.\nMake it a meditation and you will be enriched beyond comprehension.\n190\nLove.\nJohn Burroughs remembers:\nOne day my boy killed what an old hunter told him was a mock duck.\nIt looked like a duck, it acted like a duck,\nbut when it came on the table – it mocked us!\nRemember to make a clearcut distinction between your self and your mock-selves – the masks,\notherwise in the end they will all mock you! 191\nLove\nMan is strange, very strange,\nbecause he begins by deceiving others and ends with deceiving himself.\nA fakir was walking down the village street deep in thought when some urchins began to throw stones at him.\nHe was taken by surprise,\nand besides he was not a big man. Don’t do that, he said, and I will tell you something of interest to you.\nAll right, what is it? But no philosophy.\nThe king is giving a free banquet to all comers – he just lied to them.\nThe children ran off towards the king’s palace as the fakir warmed to his theme –\nthe delicacies and delights of the entertainment... He looked up and saw them disappearing in the distance,\nand then suddenly he tucked up his robes and started to sprint after them\nI had better go and see, he panted to himself, because it might he true after all.\n192\nLove.\nTo be religious is to be a yea-sayer: yes to everything –\nyes to life and yes to death,\nyes to light and yes to darkness. Total acceptance is religion.\nSays Nicolas De Cusa: Yes God! Yes God! Yes, yes and always yes\nSay YES – and feel it,\nand you have entered the temple of the divine. Say no and you yourself have closed the doors – or closed yourself to the divine.\nNo is suicidal, no is poisonous – know this and be a yea-sayer.\nLet your heart say yes with every beat. Breathe YES in and out\nand you will feel the divine all around you within and without.\nHe is always present but He cannot enter through a NO sign,\nHe cannot trespass on you.\nWith a no you are an ego\nbut with a yes you are just egolessness.\nEgo is a Leibnizian monad without any doors or windows,\nand egolessness is the gate.\nBe a gate – the divine is waiting to enter you from eternity.\n193\nLove.\nBegin to live positively, that is – with positive emotions.\nTo be negative is to be self-destructive and ultimately suicidal.\nBut ordinarily the mind works that way\nbecause it is only an instrument for safety and security; it detects death only and not life.\nSo to be completely positive is to transcend mind.\nSome fakir was asked to talk to a group about the negative nature of the mind.\nHe tacked up on the wall a large sheet of perfectly white paper.\nHe made a black spot in the paper with a pencil. Then he asked each man to say what he saw.\nEach man replied: A black spot.\nThe fakir then said: Yes, there is a little black spot.\nBut not one of you saw the big expanse of white paper\nand that is the point of my speech. 194\nLove.\nThe forms of existence are finite – all forms.\nReally, to have a form means to be finite.\nBut existence is infinite\nbecause only the formless can be infinite and existence is formlessness,\nthat is why it can take all the forms.\nBut to take form in any way is to allow death in because form is a death sentence\nwhilst existence itself is eternal life. Do not be identified with the form:\nthis identification creates the fear of death\n– in fact, all fear.\nRemember the formless\nand you will know immortality because you will be that – then. 195\nLove.\nThe attitude is everything. Negative attitudes negate life –\nthey are good for dying but not good for living. Life needs positive attitudes;\nlife feeds on them\nbecause they make you not only happy but creative also.\nOnce there lived an old woman,\nbut the older she became the younger she felt – because youthfulness has nothing to do with age, it is an attitude,\nand with age and its richness\none can really be younger than the young. The old woman was so cheerful and creative that everyone wondered at her.\nBut you must have some clouds in your life. said a visitor. Clouds? she replied. Why, of course:\nif there were no clouds\nwhere would the blessed showers come from In the presence of trouble –\nand there are troubles in life – the positive mind grows wings but others buy crutches.\nGrow wings, and do not buy crutches. 196\nThere is no security in life\nbecause life cannot exist except as insecurity – that is why the more secure one is\nthe less alive one becomes.\nDeath is complete security\nso never be in search of security because you are searching for death.\nTo live totally and in ecstasy never demands security.\nAccept insecurity blissfully and when you accept it\nthen you will know that it has a beauty of its own.\nMulla Nasrudin’s tomb\nwas fronted by an immense wooden door, barred and padlocked.\nNobody could get into it – at least through the door: as his last joke\nthe Mulla decreed that the tomb should have no walls around it.…\nOh, what the Mulla did with his tomb everybody is doing with his life – and unknowingly!\nIf you also want to do it – at least do it knowingly,\nbecause I know that knowingly you cannot do it! Not only you cannot, but no one can do it, because no stupidity can be done with oneself knowingly.\n197\nLove.\nThe universe cares for little but play.\nBut man in his life does hardly anything but work,\nand because of this everything has become upside down. Hence the agony.\nThe law, the TAO of the universe, is play – leela, and the law of the human reason is work because reason cannot think beyond utility.\nBut existence exists beyond utility.\nMeditate on this gap and you will find the bridge – and the bridge is necessary\nbecause you cannot exist without work,\nand to exist only for work is unbearable and unlivable.\nThe meditative mall works that he may play – the reason for his work is play,\nand the unmeditative man plays that he may work – the reason for his play is work.\n198\nLove.\nLife does not need comfort when it can be offered meaning nor pleasure when it can be shown purpose,\nbecause in the total intensity of intentional living is the fruition of the seed of consciousness.\nAnd consciousness without the self is the goal. Consciousness without the centre –\nand you have reached. Consciousness without ego is nirvana:\nor you may call it God or whatsoever you like. Know that everyone is seeking this state of being, but unless the seeker is lost this state of being cannot be found –\nand the seeker can only be lost\nin the fire of total intensity of living.\nSo live totally\nand live in the moment\nand moment to moment,\nbecause there is no other way to live totally,\nand no other way to dissolve the centre, the self, the ego.\n199\nLove.\nThe secret of meditation is the art of unlearning. Mind is learning;\nmeditation is unlearning:\nthat is – die constantly to your experience; let it not imprison you;\nexperience becomes a dead weight\nin the living and flowing, riverlike consciousness. Live in the moment unburdened by the past, flow in the moment unblocked by the mind,\nand you will be in meditation.\nKnow well that it is innocence that is full and experience that is empty although the surface appearance is quite the contrary.\nIt is innocence that knows and experience that knows not –\nthough innocence never claims\nand experience is nothing but claims and claims and\nclaims!\nAnd that is why I say:\nInnocence is meditation because it opens the doors of the unknown.\nSo learn how to unlearn.\nSo learn how to be beyond the mind.\nDo not cling to the known\nand the masterkey will be in your hands.\nBe open and vulnerable\nliving and flowing always into the unknown and you will be in meditation you will BE meditation.\n200\nLove.\nThree men made their way to the circle of a Sufi seeking admission to his teachings.\nAlmost at once\none of them detached himself from the group, angered by the erratic behaviour of the Master.\nOn the Master’s instructions\nthe second was told by a disciple that the sage was a fraud.\nHe withdrew soon afterwards. The third was allowed to talk\nbut was offered no teaching for so\nlong that he lost patience and left the circle.\nWhen they had all gone away\nthe teacher instructed his circle thus:\nThe first man was an illustration of the principle: Do not judge fundamental things by sight.\nThe second was an illustration of the injunction:\nDo not judge things of deep importance by hearing. The third was an example of the dictum:\nNever judge by speech or the lack of it.\nWhen asked by a disciple\nwhy the applicants could not have been instructed in this matter\nthe Master retorted: I am here to give real knowledge,\nnot to teach what people pretend\nthat they have already learned at their mother’s knees.\n201\nLove.\nAlways remember the golden rule:\nONE STEP AT A TIME.\nA goodnatured woman was often asked for food by tramps. She finally decided to refuse them;\nit was becoming too burdensome.\nBut shortly after she made her resolution one young man stopped\nand asked her for a little piece of thread.\nShe noticed that his pants were badly ripped, that he had a needle,\nand she realized he could not get work with his pants in their present condition, so she gave him the thread.\nThe fellow took the thread,\nwent down the road and sat under a tree for a few minutes, then came back to the house.\nHe told the woman he could not repair the pants unless he had a piece of cloth for a patch.\nShe gave him a small piece of material.\nAbout an hour later the young fellow came again to the house and said: Madam, these pants are beyond repair.\nIt would be very good of you\nif you could give me a pair of your husband’s old pants.\nSo she gave him a pair of old pants and smiled at his cleverness.\nThe young man went behind the barn and changed into the pants given to him.\nThen he returned to the house and told the woman\nthat the pants were sort of big around the waist, but if she could give him some food\nhe was sure they would fit perfectly. This time the woman burst out laughing and gave him a big dinner.\nAnd all because he took one step at a time. 202\nLove.\nKnowledge is accumulation,\nthat is why knowledge is always dead while learning is moment to moment\nbecause learning is not accumulation but movement.\nSo do not be dead with knowledge but move with learning,\nonly then you will be alive.\nDo not be tethered to experience – experience is slavery.\nAlways transcend that which has been so that you are ready to receive the new. Ecstasy is always with the new,\nwith the fresh, with the young,\nwith the discontinuous –\nand to be always in the discontinuous is to be in\nthe divine. 203\nLove.\nIf one is aware of the present moment\nthen one also becomes aware of the fact that there is no ME inside.\nThe me is my past,\nthe me is the dead past.\nThe me is not my life because it is not living.\nThe ego can exist only in the past or in the future –\nwhich is nothing but a projection of the past;\nthat is why awareness, moment to moment awareness, leads to egolessness:\nbecause the ego cannot exist in the present\nand because awareness cannot exist except in the present. So they both cannot exist simultaneously.\nEgo is unawareness\nand awareness is egolessness. 204\nLove.\nI live not by planning\nand I feel also that this is the only way to be alive at all.\nIn fact I live a wild life, absolutely unplanned,\nnot knowing anything about the future – not even about the next moment.\nToday is enough for me – really more than enough!\nThe moment that is present is the only living moment – the past is dead in the sense that it is no more\nand the future is also dead\nin the sense that it is not yet born.\nAnd so to be concerned with the past is to be dead and to be concerned with the future is also to be dead. The only way to be alive is to be here and now –\nin the moment and totally in it.\nLiving moment to moment I have found that ecstasy and bliss which is not of this world at all.\nThe single moment lived totally transcends time itself. It becomes the gap between two moments of time, and if one can be in this gap\nthen one is beyond death because time is death and timelessness is life.\nLife is not something fixed and finished, life is living what is,\na process, just riverlike,\nflowing always into the unknown,\nfrom the shores of the known to the shores of the unknown.\n205\nLove.\nAnger, violence, greed or envy\ncannot be overcome by the cultivation of their opposites, because anger itself will cultivate its opposite\nand violence will be present in its cultivated non-violence. So always be aware of the hypnotic spell of the opposite: it never solves any problem\nbecause it is beating around the bush. Do not fall into the trap of the opposite but understand anger, violence or greed or anything else directly.\nTo seek the opposite is a way of escape. To seek the opposite is cowardice.\nLive with your mind as it is. Do not try to change it.\nBe brave and face it and understand it.\nWhen the light of awareness falls on anger or greed or envy\nthere is change.\nAwareness acts as a catalytic agent –\nand then anger does not change into its opposite, it is not that violence becomes non-violence,\nbut there is no-anger, there is no-violence,\nand when there is no-violence there is no-mind,\nand an altogether different dimension opens its door: the dimension of the spontaneous,\nthe dimension of the divine. 206\nLove.\nMoment to moment life passes into death, because it is death.\nCovered, it appears as life, uncovered it is death.\nRemember this fact always. This is silent meditation.\nAnd when this remembering penetrates even in your dreams\nyou will have a new door opened unto you. Through it in fact you will be altogether new. And ultimately reborn.\nRemembering death gives a new dimension to consciousness\nbecause to remember death is not natural.\nOn the contrary nature has arranged that one should not be aware of it\nbecause the moment one transcends death one transcends nature also.\nAnd one cannot transcend death unless one is totally aware of the fact. So be totally aware of death.\nAnd it is happening each moment within and without. It is present everywhere.\nAnd because it is so obvious one becomes absent to it.\nRemember – and deepen the consciousness, because as the awareness of death goes deeper one becomes capable of feeling that which is deathless.\nReally, death is the door – the opening to the deathless. But be conscious of it.\nBe conscious and transcend.\nBe conscious and know that which is before birth and after death.\nAnd – you are that.\n207\nLove.\nBe a stranger to yourself.\nSee life as a river flowing through time.\nStand on the bank, neither curious nor concerned. Glance or gaze at the driftwood of your past floating in memory –\njust like the incidents one reads about in the paper. Detached and indifferent remember that nothing matters. ONLY EXIST –\nand the explosion.\n208\nLove.\nBe always positive, in each and every situation – that helps meditative awareness very much.\nNegative attitudes negate the whole effort.\nDiogenes was looking for an honest man in New Delhi. What luck? asked the wayfarer.\nOh, pretty fair, sir, replied Diogenes. I still have my lantern.\n209\nLove.\nPhilosophy cannot cure you of questions – on the contrary, it can give you more.\nThis I have heard at a chemist’s shop:\nDid the patent medicine you purchased cure your aunt?\nMercy, no.\nOn reading the circular that was wrapped around the bottle she got two more diseases.\n210\nLove.\nMulla Nasrudin was carrying home some liver which he had just bought.\nIn the other hand he held a recipe for liver pie which a friend had given him.\nSuddenly a buzzard swooped down and carried off the liver. You fool! shouted Nasrudin.\nHaving the meat is all very well,\nbut what will you do without the recipe? 211\nLove.\nMan can only know what God is not.\nTo know what God is, is impossible because there begins the realm of being. You cannot know God but you can BE, and in that dimension is the only knowing; but that knowing\nis altogether different from all our other knowings\nbecause in that knowing there is no knower and no known,\nbut only knowing.\nThat is why in that dimension knowing and being are the same.\nThere is no knowledge even\nbecause knowledge is dead and therefore a thing. Moreover, knowledge is always of the past,\nand God is never in the past nor in the future.\nGod is now, always now; and here,\nand always here.\nClose your eyes and see. Then open your eyes and see.\nThen neither close your eyes nor open your eyes and see. 212\nLove.\nThere was once a man\nwho was obsessed with the idea\nthat there was a secret knower in those who achieved success.\nTo discover this secret\nhe devoted years to study and research:\nancient masonry, philosophy, astrology, psychology, salesmanship, religious beliefs,\nthe various cults that have had their rise and fall –\nall these he studied long and diligently, but no conclusion was visible.\nHe struggled and struggled but still there was no conclusion.\nAnd then instead of success in his search for the secret of success came death – and as death approached him\nhe realized the goal of his whole life’s efforts, and finally he gave his conclusion to those who were near him.\nIt came in two short words: I WILL. 213\nLove.\nDo not believe in thinking because that is the greatest of all superstitions –\nbut well hidden\nbecause it pretends to be anti-superstitious! Thinking is nothing but dust in a blind mind because you cannot think that which is not known – and you need not think that which is already known.\nThe encounter is always with the unknown. The unknown is everywhere,\nwithin and without,\nand thinking is always in the known and of the known.\nYou call never be in contact with the unknown through the known so throw the known and be in contact with the unknown.\nAnd this is what I call meditation. 214\nLove.\nMan goes on dreaming and desiring but basically remains where he is. and in the end\nnothing but ashes of his dreams and desires are in his hands –\nand of course tears in his eyes. Panchatantra has a beautiful story:\nIn a certain town lived a Brahmin named Seedy who got some barley meal by begging,\nate a portion,\nand filled a jar with the remainder. This jar he hung on a peg one night, placed his cot beneath it\nand fixing his gaze on the jar fell into a hypnotic reverie.\nWell here is a jar of barley meal, he thought.\nNow if famine comes\na hundred rupees will come out of it. With that sum I will get two she-goats.\nEvery six months they will bear two more she-goats. After goats, cows.\nWhen the cows calve I will sell the calves. After cows, buffalos.\nAfter buffalos, mares.\nFrom the mares I shall get plenty of horses. The sale of these will mean plenty of gold.\nThe gold will buy a great house with an inner court.\nThen someone will come to my house and offer his lovely daughter with a dowry.\nShe will bear a son whom I shall call Moonlord. When he is old enough to ride on my knee I will take a book,\nsit on the stable roof and think. Just then Moonlord will see me,\nwill jump from his mother’s lap in his eagerness to ride on my knee\nand will go too near the horses.\nThen I shall get angry and tell my wife to take the boy but she will be too busy with her chores\nand will not pay attention to what I say. Then I will get up and kick her!\nBeing sunk in his hypnotic dream\nhe let fly such a kick that he smashed the jar\nand the barley meal it contained turned him white all over.\n215\nLove.\nGo on discarding: not this, not this (NETI, NETI). and ultimately when nothing remains to be discarded –\nthen is the explosion.\nDo not cling to anything, to any thought. Go on and on until the nothingness.\nI have heard about a little boy Toyo and his meditations.\nHe was only twelve years old\nbut he wanted to be given something to ponder, to meditate on,\nso one evening he went to Mokurai, the Zen master, struck the gong softly to announce his presence, and sat before the master in respectful silence.\nFinally the master said: Toyo, show me the sound of two hands.\nToyo clapped his hands.\nGood, said the master.\nNow show me the sound of one hand clapping. Toyo was silent.\nFinally he bowed and left to meditate on the problem.\nThe next night he returned and struck the gong with one palm.\nThat is not right, said the master.\nThe next night Toyo returned and played geisha music with one hand.\nThat is not right, said the master.\nAnd again and again Toyo returned with some answer but the master said again and again, That is not\nright.\nFor nights Toyo tried new sounds\nbut each and every answer was rejected.\nThe question itself was absurd so no answer could be right.\nAnd when on the eleventh night Toyo came and before he spoke anything the master said: That is still not right!\n– then he stopped coming to the master.\nFor a year he thought of every possible sound and discarded them all,\nand when there was nothing left to be discarded any more\nhe exploded into enlightenment.\nWhen he was no more he returned to the master\nand without striking the gong he sat down and bowed.\nHe was not saying anything and there was silence.\nThen the master said: So you have heard the sound without sound!\n216\nLove.\nThought is divisive,\nit divides ad infinitum,\nso thought can never come to the total, to the whole.\nand the whole is while the parts are not – or they are only for the mind:\nand if there is no mind then there are no parts.\nWith the mind and because of the mind the one becomes many – or appears so; and with the mind and through the mind, to conceive the one is impossible.\nOf course it can think about the one,\nbut that one is nothing but a putting together of all the parts,\nand that one is quite different from the one which is.\nThe one which is conceptualized by the mind is just a mathematical construct:\nit is not a living whole, it is not organic,\nand unless one experiences the cosmos as an organic whole one has not known anything at all.\nThis is not possible with thought, but this is possible with no-thought. 217\nLove.\nEMPTINESS IS ALL –\nand to get hold of emptiness is to get all and be all. But it is very arduous to get hold of emptiness – because it is emptiness! And it hurts much – though it is emptiness, still it hurts much!\nBecause to make way for it the ego has to die.\nBut I am happy that you are dying\nbecause this is the only way to be beyond death – I say: the only way.\nRemember this always.\nSekkyo said once to one of his monks: Can you get hold of emptiness –\nI will try, said the monk; and he cupped his hands in the air.\nThat is absurd, said Sekkyo.\nYou have not got anything in there.\nWell, Master, said the monk, please show me the right way.\nThereupon Sekkyo seized the monk’s nose and gave it a great yank.\nOuch! yelled the monk. You hurt me!\nI cannot help it\nbecause that is the only way to get hold of emptiness!\nsaid Sekkyo. 218\nMan asks questions and then answers them himself. Nothing is answered in this way.\nBut man is capable of deceiving himself – and the whole of philosophy\nis nothing but such a deception. Man asks: What is mind?\nand then answers himself: Not matter? nd then asks: What is matter?\nand then answers: Not mind? and this stupid game goes on.\nI have heard about a distinguished philosopher\nwho customarily began his speeches with: Why are we here?\nHe had occasion to address the inmates of a mental hospital and finally said: Ladies and Gentlemen, why are we here?\nOne of the inmates called out:\nWe are all here because we are not all there! 219\nLove.\nThe mind always thinks in terms of the self. It is egocentric.\nDuring the French revolution\na man from Paris stopped at a village\nand was asked by a friend what was happening.\nThey are cutting off heads by thousands, said the visitor. How terrible! cried the villager.\nThat could ruin my hat business! But this is the way of the mind,\nand because of this it is never in tune with the cosmos, so how can it know life?\nIt cannot know it because it cannot be one with it.\nReally with the mind there is no knowing but only superficial acquaintance.\nIntimate and deep knowing comes only with no-mind –\nand meditation is dissolving mind into no-mind. 220\nLove.\nA monk asked Hyakujo Yekai:\nWhat is the most miraculous event in the world? Hyakujo said: I sit here all by myself!\n221\nLove.\nFreedom from becoming means freedom for being. Becoming is desiring,\nbeing is that which is.\nBecoming is longing for the future, being is to be in the present.\nBecoming is mental, being is existential.\nThat is why becoming must cease for the being to reveal itself.\nBecoming is just like the smoke around the flame, or just like the outer covering around the seed,\nso please let the smoke go\nfor the flame to explode in its complete glory and splendour, and let the seed die to its outer shell\nso that it may be what it is in its innermost depth.\n222\nLove.\nNo more principles are needed.\nThe world is already much too burdened with principles\nand persons who are men of principles.\nI have heard that once a priest was consoling a widow.\nHe said feelingly about her dead husband that he was a man of principle.\nThat he was, sighed the widow.\nEvery Saturday night for these twenty years the poor man would come home\nand faithfully hand me his pay envelope – that he never missed doing.\nOf course the envelope was always empty, but mind you,\nhe was loyal to the principle of the thing. 223\nLove.\nReligion is – living without conflict, that is – without ideas\nand without ideals,\nbecause whenever one lives with ideals there is conflict,\nthere is conflict between\nthat which is and that which should be,\nand then life is misery. See this and go beyond.\nIn fact the very seeing of the fact is going beyond. And please do not ask the seemingly inevitable how? because there is no HOW to it.\nEither you see it or you do not see it –\nand moreover the how is again the creator of conflict.\n224\nLove.\nBhakti needs only time to absorb the shock she has come across\nin her deep meditations;\nremember – only time and nothing else. The shock is nothing new.\nIt happens whenever the deeper layers of the unconscious are encountered\nBefore any mutation this is absolutely necessary.\nBe grateful to the divine because this is a good omen.\nBhakti needed it badly\nand when she is out of it she will be a new person totally. Soon she will be twice-born.\nAt present she is passing through a great spiritual crisis, so you be with her – but just as if you are not.\nBe present, but with absolute absence.\nThis is the only way you can be helpful to her. Let her be alone as much as possible.\nDo not talk with her except where it is needed absolutely –\nand then too be telegraphic.\nBut if she herself wants to talk let her talk as much as she likes,\nand you yourself be just a passive listener.\nLet her do whatsoever she wants to do or not do and soon everything will be okay.\nDo not worry at all.\nI will be there beside you always –\nand if you can see, you will be able to see me also.\nOf course Bhakti will feel my presence\nand become aware of me these days so many times. Convey my blessings to her.\n225\nLove.\nOne day a man came to the Sufi teacher Bahaudin.\nHe asked for help in his problems and guidance on the path.\nBahaudin told him to abandon spiritual studies and to leave his court at once.\nA kind-hearted visitor began to remonstrate with Bahaudin.\nYou shall have a demonstration, said the Master.\nAt that moment a bird flew into the room darting hither and thither\nnot knowing where to go in order to escape.\nThe Master waited\nuntil the bird settled near the only open window\nof the chamber and then suddenly clapped his hands. Alarmed,\nthe bird flew straight through the opening of the window to freedom.\nTo him that sound must have been something of a shock, even an affront, do you not agree? said Bahaudin.\n226\nLove.\nFu Ta Shih says:\nEach night one embraces a Buddha while sleeping Each morning one gets up again with him\nRising or sitting –\nboth watch and follow one another Speaking or not speaking –\nboth are in the same place\nThey never part even for a moment\nbut are like the body and its shadow.\nIf you wish to know the Buddha’s whereabouts, in the sound of your own voice –\nthere he is.\nDo you understand this?\nIf not now – when will you understand?\nAnd this is not being asked for the first time, but many many times in many many lives the same question has been raised –\nand you have not yet answered! Now, is it not time enough?\n227\nLove.\nMind is localization of consciousness,\nand it can be localized in any part of the body.\nOrdinarily we have localized it in the head\nbut other cultures and other civilizations in the past have tried other parts of the body also,\nand on other planets\nthere are beings with other parts of their bodies working as their minds,\nbut whatsoever may be the part chosen localization of consciousness means its freezing, and whenever it ceases to flow freely as is needed\nit is no more consciousness in its suchness. Meditation means: consciousness in its suchness, so let consciousness fill the whole body,\nlet it flow throughout the totality of your being and you will have a feeling of aliveness which is never known and felt by localized consciousness.\nWhenever there is localization of consciousness the part in which the localization happens becomes tense and diseased\nand the remainder of the body becomes a dead weight.\nBut with meditative consciousness or flowing consciousness everything changes completely:\nthe whole body becomes alive, sensitive and aware and consequently weightless.\nThen there is no centre for tensions to exist and accumulate because they cannot exist without frozen blocks of consciousness.\nThe flowing, the moving, consciousness\nwashes them out constantly with every movement, and when the whole body is alive\nonly then you begin to feel the cosmic consciousness all around you.\nHow can a frozen consciousness,\nand that too surrounded by a dead body,\nfeel the cosmic?\n228\nNow man knows more about man than ever and yet no problem is solved.\nIt seems that something is basically wrong with our so-called knowledge itself.\nThis whole knowledge is derived from analysis and analysis is incapable of penetrating\ninto the depths of consciousness.\nThe analytical method is all right with matter or with things because there is no inside to them,\nbut consciousness is insideness,\nand to use the analytical method with consciousness is to treat it as an object\nwhile it is not an object at all. And it cannot be made an object; its very nature is subjectivity,\nits being is subjectivity,\nso it must not be approached from outside\nbecause then whatsoever is known about it is not about it. Consciousness must be approached from inside –\nand then the method is meditation and not analysis. Meditation is synthetic:\nit is concerned with the whole and not with the parts\nit is subjective and not objective,\nit is irrational or super-rational and not rational, it is religious or mystic and not scientific.\nAuthentic knowledge of consciousness\ncomes only through meditation and all else is just superficial acquaintance and basically erroneous\nbecause the very source of it is fallacious and poisonous. 229\nLove.\nLife is a dream so enjoy it;\nbut do not ask for more because then you only disturb the dream\nand get nothing except a disturbed night.\nBe a witness to the dreaming mind and then there is transcendence:\nthen you go beyond dreaming and beyond mind itself.\nAnd know well that there is an awakening BELOW the dreaming mind which is nothing but just a disturbed dream.\nOne can get to this below-dreaming state of awakening through asking for more desiring more –\nas ordinarily we all do.\nIn a dream Mulla Nasrudin saw himself being counted out coins and when there were nine silver pieces in his hand\nthe invisible donor stopped giving them.\nNasrudin shouted: I MUST HAVE TEN! So loudly that he woke himself up.\nFinding that all the money had disappeared he closed his eyes again and murmured, All right then give them back –\nI will take the nine.\nThere is also an awakening above the dreaming mind – the real awakening\nin comparison to which man ordinarily is asleep.\nOne can get to this awakening\nthrough witnessing the dreaming mind –\nand unless one gets to it one is not really alive. 230\nLove.\nThe divine is that from which one cannot depart, and that from which one can depart is not the divine.\nSo find that from which you have never departed and cannot ever depart from –\nand then laugh at the absurdity of the human mind and its efforts!\nBuddha is still laughing because of that Listen!\n231\nLove.\nWhy does man suffer?\nMan suffers because of his craving,\ncraving to possess that which cannot be possessed, and craving to keep things for ever with himself which are essentially impermanent.\nAnd chief among these things is his own ego, his own persona.\nBut all things are impermanent. Except for change itself. everything changes.\nReally nothing is\nbecause everything is only a process,\nso as soon as one tries to possess anything it slips away.\nThe possessor himself is slipping away constantly! Then there is frustration.\nand then there is suffering. Know this well,\nrealize this well and there will be no suffering because then you have uprooted the root.\n232\nLove.\nThe self can never be free –\nbecause the self itself is the bondage.\nThis is the meaning of the penetrating saying of Jesus:\nHe that saveth his life shall lose it\nand he that loseth his life shall keep it unto life eternal. Or that of Lao Tzu in TAO-TE-KING:\nHe who humbles himself shall be saved, he who bends shall be made straight\nand he who empties himself shall be filled. One is not to make the self free;\nrather on the contrary, ONE HAS TO BE FREE FROM THE SELF. The self is nothing but the husk of the seed.\nDo not cling to it.\nSings Wu Ming Fu:\nThe seed that has to grow must lose itself as seed,\nand they that creep may graduate through chrysalis to wings.\nWilt thou then, O mortal, cling to husks which falsely seem to you the self?\n233\nLove.\nThe gates of the temple are wide open and it is only after thousands of years that such opportunity comes to this earth.\nKnow well that they will not remain open for ever, the opportunity can be lost very easily,\nand you are still wavering, and you are still hesitating – to enter or not to enter –\nto be or not to be.\nI know that the challenge is great, but I know also that your being is completely ready to take the jump. Hence my insistent call for you to come and enter.\nAnd this is not for the first time that I have called you. nor the first life;\nI know you Bhakti, through so many births! And soon you will also remember many things. But not before the jump.\nOnly your superficial persona is resisting, not you –\nand it is expected to resist always\nbecause the moment one take the plunge into the unknown\nit has to die naturally.\nSo please do not identify yourself with it;\nbe a witness to it, and you will be in the jump. Oh, it is time enough now to die to the old ego and be reborn to the supreme self!\n234\nLove.\nLogic is not all; neither is consistency;\nbecause even madness has its own methods, rationalizations and inner consistencies.\nA madman was throwing handfuls of crumbs around his house. What are you doing? someone asked him.\nKeeping the elephants away, he answered.\nBut there are no elephants in these parts, said the enquirer.\nThat is right.\nMy method is effective isn’t it? declared the madman. 235\nLove.\nTotal acceptance of existence is impossible for the mind because the mind exists as denial.\nIt exists with the NO.\nand with a total YES it dies.\nSo it continues to find reasons to say no even if there are no reasons.\nWalking with a disciple one day\nMulla Nasrudin saw for the first time in his life a beautiful lakeland scene.\nWhat a delight! he exclaimed. But if only, if only... If only what, Master? asked the disciple.\nIf only they had not put water into it! said the Mulla. 236\nLove.\nMeditation is like the sea:\nreceiving the dirty river and yet remaining pure. You need not be purified before it,\nbut you will come purified out of it. Meditation is unconditional,\npurity is not a prerequirement but a consequence. 237\nLove.\nBe like a dead one,\nand then dualisms will not contaminate you\nand you will reach the state of non-arising of thought, the brightness of self-nature will appear in full –\nand when this happens you are no more.\nThis disappearance is the appearance of the divine, so please – DISAPPEAR!\n238\nLove.\nExistence exists in order to exist – And likewise life.\nThere is no meaning to it beyond itself so never posit any meaning\notherwise you will feel its meaninglessness. It is not meaningless and it cannot be so because there is no meaning in it all!\nThe very search for meaning is mean and ugly because it comes from the utilitarian mind of man.\nExistence simply is and likewise life:\nthere is no purpose in it and there is no end to it. Oh, feel it here and now!\nPlease do not practise it\nbecause that is the way of the utilitarian mind.\nBe playful\nand only then will you know the playfulness of the universe.\nAnd to know that is to be religious. 239\nLove.\nDo not continue circling in the old rut – and the way out is just by your hand. The mind is the past, the dead past;\none has to break it somewhere and jump out of it The mind is the prison, the slavery.\nBe free of it.\nAnd the moment is ripe.\nOf course I know that you are still not clearly aware of it but you are not unaware either.\nGather courage and jump into the unknown.\nOne step only is enough\nbecause the next follows it automatically.\nBut do not go on thinking and thinking and thinking.\nThinking promises to lead you somewhere but the promise remains always a promise\nbecause thinking is just impotent as far as life is concerned. So please, be existential.\nDo not hesitate.\nAnd You have nothing to lose – because you have nothing!\nRealize this and be nothing – no-one. 240\nLove.\nLife is movement, process,\nfluidity;\nbut ideas become fixed,\nso they become also anti-life. They become dead blocks.\nDo not remain with them.\nMOVE.\nAnd do not fear inconsistency because life is not a syllogism, life is not a theory\nbut a mystery.\nSomeone asked Mulla Nasrudin: How old are you, Mulla? Forty.\nBut you said the same last time I asked you, five years ago!\nYes, I am always consistent and always stand by what I have said. 241\nLove.\nMind means consciousness somewhere – centred,\nfocussed and tense.\nMeditation means consciousness nowhere, and when it is nowhere it is everywhere – decentralized.\nunfocussed and non-tense.\nMind is agony by its very nature, meditation – ecstasy.\nDo not treat consciousness like a cat tied to a string. This very treatment –\nor mistreatment –\ncreates the mind\nThe consciousness must be left to itself. utterly free to move\nand be,\naccording to its nature. Do not localize it.\nDo not partialize it.\nThis is the essence of my discipline of no-discipline.\nPreserve the absolute fluidity of your consciousness and then you will not he.\nand when you are not and only consciousness is then for the first time the doors of the divine are open to you.\n242\nLove.\nYes, man learns by experience!\nTwo old drunkards\nwere in the habit of coming together twice a week to the wineseller to get drunk.\nAfter years of this one of them died. His old friend came in on the Saturday and they told him his pal had died –\nthat the whisky had been taken into blood circulation\nand so saturated his blood and his breath that one night before going to bed\nthe old man went to blow out the candle\nand his breath caught fire and he was burned to death.\nThe other man promptly called for a bible and took all oath that from that time forward\nhe would never blow out another candle in his life! Yes, man learns by experience!\n243\nLove.\nDo not imitate anyone, do not follow anyone,\notherwise you will be just a pseudo existence – and that is worse than suicide.\nBE YOURSELF –\nand only then can you be responsible and authentic\nand real.\nBut ordinarily everyone is just secondhand and borrowed,\nand that makes everything ugly.\nMulla Nasrudin went to a mosque and sat down.\nHis shirt was rather short\nand the man behind him pulled it lower,\nthinking it looked unseemly.\nNasrudin immediately pulled the shirt of the man in front of him. What are you doing? asked the man in front.\nDon’t ask me. Ask the man behind – he started it, said Nasrudin.\n244\nLove.\nThe real religious experience\ncannot be organized, taught or transmitted. To systematize it is to kill it.\nIt is so living and moving and dynamic\nthat to impose a pattern on it is impossible;\nand the experience is always so unique and individual that it cannot be put into any category –\nalthough it happens when the individual is not! It cannot be followed,\nfor everyone has to find it for himself, and that is the beauty of it,\nand also its freedom and virginity.\nIt is not new in the sense of any opposition to the old, it is new in the sense of timelessness –\nthat is, with eternal freshness and innocence – as every flower is new\nand every sunrise is new\nand every love is new.\nIt is not borrowed from the past, it is not based on any tradition. it is not derived from without,\nit happens within without any causality.\nIt happens unconditionally.\nIt is not continuous with the mind, it is a discontinuous explosion.\nThere are clouds in the sky and the sky cannot be seen, but there is no causal chain.\nThe clouds have gone and the sky is clear\nbut there is no cause-and-effect relationship. The sky has not even known the clouds!\nIt has not been affected by them in any way whatsoever.\n245\nLove.\nLife becomes more authentic\nin the encountering of death directly.\nBut we always try to escape the fact of death, and thereby life becomes pseudo and phoney.\nEven death when authentic has a beauty of its own while pseudo-life is just ugly.\nMeditate on death\nbecause there is no way to know life unless you stand face to face with death – and it is everywhere;\nwherever life is death is also;\nthey are really two aspects of one and the same phenomenon, and when one comes to know this, he transcends both.\nOnly in that transcendence is the total flowering of consciousness\nand the ecstasy of being. 246\nLove.\nMan adds everything to his ego – while everything goes on without him. He is nothing,\nbut he thinks himself everything.\nMulla Nasrudin was walking past a well when he had the impulse to look into it. It was night,\nand as he peered into the deep water he saw the moon’s reflection there.\nI must save the moon! the Mulla thought.\nOtherwise she will never wane and the fasting month of Ramadan will never come to an end.\nHe found a rope, threw it in and called down: Hold tight! Keep bright, succour is at hand! The rope caught in a rock inside the well and Nasrudin heaved as hard as he could.\nStraining back he suddenly felt the rope give way as it became loose and he was thrown on his back.\nAs he lay there panting\nhe saw the moon riding on the sky above. Glad to be of service, said Nasrudin.\nJust as well I came along, wasn’t it? 247\nLove.\nAre you really aware of what anger is?\nAre you really aware of it when it is present?\nI ask these questions\nbecause man is never present in the present.\nMan lives in the past\nand only becomes aware of anything when it has become a part of memory.\nOne becomes aware of anger and sadness only when they are all over,\nand then awareness is just pseudo-awareness; it is not awareness but remembering\nand remembering leads nowhere because it is running in a circle. Then one can fight with anger but can never understand it,\nand fighting with anger is anger – of course more subtle\nand therefore more strong and more poisonous.\nSo do not think about anger or sadness or happiness\nand do not misunderstand remembering them as an awareness but be aware when anger is present.\nBe totally conscious of it,\nlive it consciously and do not escape from it and then you will know what it is.\nTo understand it is to transcend it.\nThen you will find a silence descending on you which passes all understanding.\n248\nLove.\nNever to have seen the truth is better than to have seen it and not to have acted upon it. 249\nLove.\nOne should never be afraid of rising thoughts or desires but only of the delay in being aware of them.\n250\nLove.\nThe purest ore is produced from the hottest furnace;\nand the brook would lose its song if we removed the rocks. 251\nLove.\nBe empty and you will know.\nBe empty and you will be the mirror.\nOh, only total nothingess is capable fo knowing all!\nI have heard that the nun Chiyono studied for years\nand meditated for years on the ultimate questions of existence but was unable to find the light.\nThe thinking was filling her so much\nthat she could not be a passage to the divine.\nShe was so much filled by herself\nthat she could not be a host to the divine guest, and the more she longed for enlightenment\nthe more far off it was.\nBut one moonlit night she was carrying an old pail filled with water\n– and the thing happened!\nShe was watching the full moon reflected in her pail water when the bamboo drip that held the pail staves broke.\nThe pail fell all apart, the water rushed out,\nthe moon’s reflection disappeared – and with it disappeared Chiyono herself.\nShe was not – but the enlightenment was there! She wrote this verse:\nThis way and that way\nI tried to keep the pail together hoping the weak bamboo would never break.\nBut suddenly the bottom fell out:\nno more water\nno more moon in the water – and emptiness in my hand! 252\nLove.\nOne day Lin-chi was asked: What is the essence of meditation?\nLin-chi came right down from his seat\nand taking hold of the questioner by the front of his robe, slapped his face, then let him go.\nThe questioner, of course, stood there stupefied.\nThen Lin-chi laughed and said to him: Why don’t you bow?\nThis woke him from his reverie,\nand when he was about to make a bow to the Master he had his first taste of meditation!\nPlease read this again and again and again, and if you do not have the same taste\nthen slap your face yourself\nthen laugh and bow down to yourself –\nand then you will have the same taste, surely! 253\nThe sun is rising high in the sky.\nIts light enters the house through an opening.\nThe dust is seen moving in the ray of light\nbut the empty space of the room is unmoving. Now close your eyes and be silent.\nThen ask yourself: Who am I –\nthe moving dust or the unmoving space of the room? Do not answer intellectually,\nbecause intellectual answers are not answers, but wait and realize.\nHsu Yun says: The mind is nothing but the foreign dust. Who are you – the mind? – the foreign dust? or – ?\n254\nLove.\nThe mind is, to raise questions,\nbut only questions, it never answers,\nand it can never answer – that is beyond it,\nit is not meant for that, that is not its function. But it TRIES to answer,\nand the result is the mess called philosophy! Meditation never questions,\nbut it answers. It is the answer,\nbecause it is life, because it is existence.\nQuestion – and there is no answer.\nDo not question – and you are the answer. Why is it so?\nIt is so because the questioning consciousness, mind,\nis disturbed,\nand the non-questioning consciousness, no mind, is silent, quiet and at rest in its suchness.\nPhilosophy comes out of questioning,\nreligion out of the non-questioning consciousness. Logic is the method of philosophy\nand meditation the method of religion. 255\nLove.\nIf the present is just continuous with the past then it is not present at all.\nTo be present,\nthe present must be discontinuous with the past, only then is it young, fresh and new –\nand then it is not a part of time but is eternity itself.\nThe now is eternal\nbut we live in the past or in the future –\nwhich is nothing but a faint echo of the past itself. our whole activity springs from the past\nor for the future –\nwhich is the same thing.\nThen the present is false and dead:\nand if the present is false then we cannot be real, and if the present is dead then we cannot be alive.\nThat is why I insist on living in the present and dying each moment to the past.\nLive atomically – moment to moment,\nand then your life will have a totally different quality – the quality of the divine.\n256\nLove.\nTo me meditation means:\nbe playful and transcend all seriousness. See: life is not serious.\nLook around: existence is not serious.\nOnly disease is serious, and of course death, and the exploiters of death: the priests!\nLife is playful and festive and therefore purposeless.\nIt is not going anywhere, because there is nowhere to go. It is always here and here.\nIt is always now and now.\nIt is just abundant energy overflowing from here to here and from now to now,\nand once you know it and be it\nyou are in that ecstasy which is the purpose of purposelessness!\nDon’t be a mind and you will know it and be it. Meditation is nomindedness.\nMind is thinking, and thinking is going astray from the being. Mind is forgetfulness of ‘that which is’.\nMeditation is coming back home. So, come back home.\nAnd I create situations so that you may remember the forgotten,\nand I will go on creating situations until you are back. 257\nThere are things which cannot be proved, and there is no evidence for them because they are self-evident,\nand to try to prove them is ridiculous,\nand the effort shows that one is not acquainted with them. Such are all the proofs of God.\nSitting one day in the teahouse\nMulla Nasrudin heard the rhetoric of a travelling scholar. He was arguing for the existence of God;\nquestioned by one of the company on some point the scholar drew a book from his pocket\nand banged it on the table:\nThis is my evidence! AND I wrote it myself!\nA man who could not only read but write was a rarity, and a man who had written a book...!\nThe villagers treated the pundit with profound respect – and of course Mulla Nasrudin was impressed!\nSome days later Mulla appeared at the teahouse and asked whether anyone wanted to buy a house. Tell us something about it.\nMulla, the people asked him.\nfor we did not even know that you had a house of your own\nActions speak louder than words! shouted Mulla, and from his pocket he took a brick\nand hurled it on the table in front of them. This is my evidence! Examine it for quality – and I built the house myself!\n258\nLove.\nWhen you are with me be completely at ease and relaxed; that is, be totally yourself.\nIf you feel like crying, then cry;\nif you feel like weeping, then weep; but just be uninterruptedly aware.\nDo not think about what you are doing – just be the doing,\nand when your senses are shaken like leaves in the wind – then enter this shaking,\nbecause only in such situations the being is revealed.\nIf a mood against someone or for someone arises do not place it on the person in question\nbut remain centred in yourself\nand you will know a transcendence which is not of this world at all.\n259\nLove.\nThe past is not nor the future is,\nbut the mind exists between these two non-existences,\nand therefore – the misery.\nTo live in the mind is to live in misery. In agony and in hell.\nThe mind is the hell.\nBe aware suddenly of this\nand then there is a new opening:\nthe opening of the present, the opening of that-which is.\nThe present is the only existence or, it is the existence.\nBE in it and you are liberated. Live in it and there is bliss.\n260\nLove.\nNo ideology can help to create a new world or a new mind\nor a new human being\nbecause ideological orientation itself\nis the root cause of all the conflicts and all the miseries. Thought creates boundaries,\nthought creates divisions\nand thought creates prejudices –\nand thought itself cannot bridge them; that is why all ideologies fail.\nNow man must learn to live without ideologies:\nreligious, political or otherwise.\nWhen the mind is not tethered to any ideology it is free to move to new understandings.\nAnd in that freedom flowers all that is good and all that is beautiful.\n261\nLove.\nA disciple of Rinzai met a party of three men on a river bridge. One of the three asked him: How deep is the river of meditation? Find out for yourself, he said,\nand offered to throw the questioner from the bridge.\nBut unfortunately the man ran away from him in time and escaped!\nIf you meet such a man who can throw you in the river be fortunate enough to be thrown so!\nAnd you have met such a man! Now be THROWN.\n262\nLove.\nYou possess only that which will not be lost in death;\nall else is illusion – even the possessor,\nbecause that too will not be able to stand the final shipwreck.\nThen find out what is left. Turn in and meditate.\nDiscard all that is vulnerable to death.\nSay: Not this, not that\nand go deep to the point where nothing more remains to be discarded\n– and the illumination.\n263\nLove.\nNothing great is ever accomplished without going mad, that is, without breaking through\nthe ordinary level of consciousness\nand letting loose the hidden powers lying further below, and also penetrating to the realm that is further above.\n– And it may not be true for any other great thing,\nbut it is absolutely true as far as meditation is concerned. Meditation means MADNESS –\nof course, with a method! 264\nLove.\nDetach yourself from all fixed ideas:\nthey are the killers of all livingness and innocence – which are musts for illumination.\nBeware of the trap of preconceptions;\nthey make a stagnant pool of your consciousness, and to meet the ocean you need a dynamic one. Be alive and fluid and flowing –\nthen the goal is not far off. 265\nLove.\nMeditation is disciplined opening of the self to God.\nBecause of fear we are closed, and only love can become a door. So love more –\nor rather be loving, then there is less fear and less tension, and you are more open.\nThis help meditation as nothing helps. Meditation plus love is the path.\n266\nLove.\nTruth is never secondhand, it cannot be transferred.\nOne has to know it and be it oneself – that is why all tradition falsifies it,\nand all scriptures,\nand all words, and in the end\nit is nothing but the soup of Mulla Nasrudin... But first I must tell you the story.\nA kinsman came to see Nasrudin from the country and brought a duck.\nNasrudin was grateful,\nhad the bird cooked, and shared it with the guest. Presently another visitor arrived.\nI am a friend, he said, of the man who gave you the duck. Nasrudin fed him as well.\nThis happened several times.\nNasrudin’s house had become like a restaurant for out-of-town visitors.\nEveryone was a friend at some remove of the original donor of the duck.\nFinally Nasrudin was exasperated.\nOne day there was a knock at the door and a stranger appeared.\nI am the friend of the friend of the friend of the man who brought you the duck from the country, he said. Come in, said Nasrudin.\nThey seated themselves at the table\nand Nasrudin asked his wife to bring the soup.\nWhen the guest tasted it\nit seemed to be nothing more than warm water. What sort of soup is this? he asked the Mulla. That, said Nasrudin,\nis the soup of the soup of the soup of the soup of the duck.\n267\nLove.\nMan is not a rational animal, but only a rationalizing one;\nand that is more dangerous than just to be irrational. Give me a shot of bourbon and a shot of water – said the obviously heavy drinker to the bartender.\nWhen the order was placed before him on the bar the lush pulled a worm from his pocket\nand dropped it into the glass of water.\nAfter watching it swim around for a few seconds the man drew the worm from the water\nand dropped it into the whisky.\nIt wriggled briefly, then curled up and died. You see that? said the lush to the bartender. It proves that if you keep on drinking whisky you will never have worms.\n268\nLove.\nLife is a sermon;\nexistence preaches in its own way, but always indirectly –\nand that is the beauty of it.\nThe harmony in nature teaches, without any intention,\nthe lesson of proportion m life. Look at a bird on the wing –\nand you will go into meditation without effort, or listen to its song –\nand your heart will move with it without any motivation, and when there is no effort on your part\nthe meditation goes deep and transforms you suddenly; and when there is no motivation and you move –\nthe movement is in the divine. 269\nLove.\nI know your inner condition more than you know it yourself because now your inner is not my outer.\nThings that are happening to you unconsciously and even against your conscious will are good. Welcome them and be grateful,\nbecause nothing divine can happen to you with your will,\nrather, your will is the only barrier in the way. Say wholeheartedly: THY WILL BE DONE! and feel it\nand live it.\nCome home soon,\nI am waiting for you,\nand much is waiting to happen to you also. I know you are sceptical.\nThat is not bad\nbut a good beginning to start with. Wherever there is mind there is scepticism.\nMind IS scepticism and therefore conflict.\nThat is the way of the mind and its nature.\nPlease do not fight with it\nand neither be identified with it. These are the obvious alternatives, but both are false,\nand aspects of the same coin. You will have to walk in between.\nCome and be with me, and you will understand. 270\nDear Mukta.\nLove.\nYes, you were related to Yoga Vivek in one of your past lives.\nNow many things will be remembered by you soon because the key is in your hands.\nBut do not think about them at all\notherwise your imagination will get mixed up with the memories and then it will be difficult to know\nwhat is real and what is not.\nSo be always aware from now\nthat you are not to think about past lives: let the memories come up by themselves. No conscious effort on your part is needed; on the contrary it will be a great hindrance. Let the unconscious do the work,\nyou be just a witness,\nand as the meditation will go deeper many locked doors will be opened to you.\nBut always remember to wait for the mysteries to reveal themselves.\nThe seed is broken – and much is to follow. You need only wait and be a witness.\n271\nLove.\nOh, just drop yourself into the divine and be purified!\nSurrender and be reborn. Do not resist.\nLet go!\n272\nLove.\nSee: this is a white paper – it contains words.\nYou can look at it as white paper or as words. Or, listen to the silence which contains a sonata; you can be aware of the silence or of the sonata. Or, think of the space which contains a building; you can be aware of the space or of the building. Or, imagine an empty house;\nyou can conceive of it as the walls or as an emptiness.\nIf you see the words, the building, the sonata and the walls you are in the mind,\nbut if you see the white paper or the silence or the space\nor the emptiness\nthen you are in meditation. 273\nLove.\nFrom sound to soundlessness is the path. Intone a sound as A-U-M,\nslowly, and as sound enters soundlessness so do you; or: remain in the gap between any two sounds\nand you yourself will become soundlessness; or: bathe in the continuous sound of a waterfall, or any other;\nor: by putting fingers in the ears\nhear the source sound of all sounds – and there will be a sudden explosion\nof the silent music of the cosmos upon you.\nIn any way fall into the abyss of soundlessness and you will achieve the divine.\n274\nLove.\nI am thrilled with great expectations about you.\nOh, much is to happen within you and without also. You are on the verge of the explosion,\nso be alone.\nNot lonely but alone,\nand live with that aloneness. Rather, BE that aloneness;\nthat is the only meditation for you now. Loneliness is negative.\nTo be lonely is to be aware of the absence of others but to be alone is the most positive state of mind.\nIt is to be aware of the presence of oneself: Be aware of the presence that is you.\nJust be aware and wait, wait for the happening.\nNear, very near is the moment.\nAnd remember that I am always with you.\nI have always been with you even when you did not know me. And always feel my blessings.\n275\nLove.\nTakuan says: You cannot bathe in solid ice, neither can you live in frozen consciousness – and what is mind except that?\nGo in and find out; do not ask anybody,\ndo not go to the scriptures, go in and find out.\nDo not think about it because that is absurd –\nhow can you think against mind?\nAny conclusion out of thinking can only strengthen the mind.\nDo not think\nbecause thinking is stopping, halting and freezing. Thinking is the disease.\nGo in and find out – IMMEDIATELY.\nA moment’s thinking\nand you are again in the old rut.\nA moment’s thinking\nand you are as far off from the real as is possible. 276\nLove.\nWe kneel down to ourselves\nbecause we kneel down to the gods we make\nout of our experience or out of our desires and dreams or out of our so called logic and foolish arguments.\nThis is neither humility nor prayer,\nrather on the contrary this is the most egoistic attitude possible. The true religious mind is one which just kneels down –\nnot to anyone, not to any image in particular.\nThis kneeling down is nothing but\na flowering of one’s total nothingness.\nThen this kneeling down becomes an inner way of life, and unless prayer is such, prayer is not.\nOne cannot pray, one can only be prayerful. 277\nLove.\nYou cannot run away from the self because you are the self –\nhow can you run away from it?\nIt is like running from one’s own shadow and all your efforts are bound to be futile. Rather, stop and see it,\nwitness it,\nbe aware of it.\nFace the shadow and then – where is it? It has never been, really.\nYou created it by not facing it\nand you strengthened it by running from it. Is it not time enough now to stop the game? 278\nLove.\nSearch – and the ego is always somewhere behind. Search – and in every act the ego is the motivation.\nBut if one can find it so and can realize it\nso one goes beyond it\nbecause the very realization is the going beyond. Brother, said Mulla Nasrudin to a neighbour,\nI am collecting to pay the debt of a poor man who cannot meet his obligations.\nVery laudable, said the other, and gave him a coin. Who is this person?\nMe, said Nasrudin as he hurried away.\nA few weeks later he was at the door again. I suppose you are calling about a debt, said the non cynical neighbour.\nI am.\nI suppose someone can’t pay a debt and you want a contribution?\nThat is so.\nI suppose it is you who owes the money? Not this time.\nWell, I am glad to hear it.\nTake this contribution.\nNasrudin pocketed the money. Just one thing Mulla –\nwhat prompts your humanitarian sentiments in this particular case?\nAh, you see...I am the creditor! 279\nLove.\nKnowledge is through experiencing. Mere information is not knowledge,\non the contrary it cannot give the clarity\nwhich knowledge gives to the mind and may confuse one more\nbecause a confused mind is still more burdened with it. Two men had played chess regularly together for several years.\nThey were quite evenly matched\nand there was keen rivalry between them.\nThen one man began to beat his rival nearly every time they played\nand the other man was completely at a loss to understand this phenomenon.\nOn the contrary, he was expecting his game to improve because he was reading a four-volume set\non HOW TO PLAY CHESS!\nAfter much thought he came up with an idea. He sent the books to his friend as a gift –\nand it was not long before they were evenly matched again!\n280\nLove.\nThere is no proof of the divine in the world for it is hidden and hidden and hidden.\nBut in you there is the absolute proof, for it is hidden and hidden and hidden.\nGo in and discover it. Thinking about it will not help:\naction is needed, action upon oneself – so ACT.\nThat is, TURN IN.\nMan is like a sealed book written before he was born,\nand ordinarily he carries it unopened inside himself until he dies.\nOne who opens it knows that HE IS NOT and only the divine is.\n281\nTruth is aristocratic;\nit cannot be decided by votes or numbers because truth is enough in itself,\nit needs no help or support;\nit needs no proof even because truth is self-evident.\nA certain man was believed to have died and was being prepared for burial\nwhen he revived.\nHe sat up but\nhe was so shocked at the scene around him that he fainted. He was put in a coffin\nand the funeral party set off for the cemetery.\nJust as they arrived at the grave he regained consciousness, lifted the coffin lid\nand cried out for help.\nIt is not possible that he has revived, said the mourners, because he has been certified as dead by competent experts. BUT I AM ALIVE! shouted the man.\nHe appealed to a well-known and impartial scientist and jurisprudent who was present.\nJust a moment, said the expert.\nHe then turned to the mourners, counting them:\nNow we have heard what the alleged deceased has had to say; you fifty witnesses tell me what you regard as the truth\nHe is dead, said the witnesses. Bury him, said the expert.\nAnd so he was buried.\n282\nLove.\nChoice is the root cause of all anguish. CHOOSE and you always choose hell – even when you choose heaven!\nAnd who chooses hell directly? Yet everyone lives in hell!\nOh, the trick!\nThe gates of heaven open into hell! Then what is to be done?\nNothing at all,\nbecause in doing nothing\nyou can rest content with all things as they are. and you have knocked at the right door\nwithout even knocking!\n283\nLove.\nSilence is benediction\nbut not the silence you can create, because you are the noise\nso you cannot create silence:\nbut you can create the illusion of it,\nand this illusion is created by all sorts of autohypnotic techniques.\nSo never use autosuggestions to be silent;\nrather, be aware of the constantly chattering mind, and be aware, not to make it still, but to understand it,\nand this very understanding flowers into a silence which is not just absence of noise\nbut a positive bliss. 284\nLove.\nTo explore truth one must be free of one’s prejudices – that is, from oneself,\notherwise one goes round and round in circles –\nbecause the known can never be the door for the unknown; and the known is the mind,\nso mind becomes the barrier:\nlook attentively at this fact.\nBe alert to the vicious circle of the mind – and then there is transcendence.\nThe known must cease for the unknown to be. The known must go for the unknown to come in – and this cessation of the known is meditation.\n285\nLove.\nThe more deeply you go within yourself the less and less you will find yourself –\nand yet THAT is the very heart of your being. And vice versa also:\nbecause the more you go without\nthe more and more you will find yourself –\nand yet that is the very heart of your non-being. These are the two ways you can go.\nThe first is the way of meditation,\nand the second is the way of the mind. 286\nLove.\nBe ordinary, so ordinary that virtually you come to be nobody –\nand there is the opening, and there is the explosion.\nOnly when you are not are you the extraordinary!\nBut do not think about it and do not crave for it,\nand if the craving comes – be aware and laugh.\nIt will be stopped in awareness\nand the created energy will be used by the laughter, and after the laugh you will feel a deep relaxation.\nThen begin to dance or sing\nand the negative state of the mind will be transformed into the positive.\nThe craving to be someone, somebody, is absolutely negative because the ego is the negation of being.\nThe ego is the principle of negation,\nand if the negative is negated then you are positive. The ego is the source of all inferiority,\nbut the trick is subtle\nbecause the ego promises superiority\nand in the end only results in inferiority.\nDecode this secret and understand it very clearly. One who thinks in terms of superiority will remain always inferior\nbecause these are two aspects of the same coin.\nOh! Sow the seeds of superiority\nand you will reap the crop of inferiority.\nBegin with the longing of superiority\nand you will end with nothing but inferiority and all the hell that is involved in it.\nBegin with humbleness, with humility, and you are nearer to the divine.\nIn fact you are divine\nbut the ego will not allow you any gap to look into your own divinity.\non the contrary it will go on creating new imaginary heavens\nonly to make way for new hells.\nEnter heaven and you are entering hell!\nBeware of this, and beware of your so-called self – the creator of all the agonies that exist on earth.\nAnd be a no-self and you will be that which you are already and have been always –\nthat which is bliss eternal,\nand freedom,\nand the cosmic being, the brahman. TAT TWAM ASI – that art thou, my love. 287\nLove.\nMan is unaware of himself.\nHe does not know what is happening to him, nor does he know the state of his being.\nA man cut down a tree one day.\nA Sufi who saw this taking place said:\nLook at this fresh branch which is full of sap and happy because it does not know yet that it has been cut off.\nBut his companion said:\nYes, ignorant of the damage it has suffered it may be, but it will know in due time.\nHearing this the Sufi laughed and said: Meanwhile you cannot reason with it. This reverence is the state of man.\nthis ignorance is the state of man –\nand meanwhile you cannot reason with him! Or can you?\nBut this is irrelevant.\nIf you can reason with yourself that is more than enough!\n288\nLove.\nIn life everything is whole, and organically whole.\nYou cannot divide it or do it in part.\nLove is like that\nand meditation is also like that. Even death is like that.\nThat is why I say:\nDeath is not dead but organically one with life. You cannot die partially!\n– either you die or you do not die. Nor can you die gradually.\nPlease remember this always\nwhen you are in meditation or in prayer or in worship.\nA very valuable dachshund\nowned by a wealthy woman was run over.\nThe policeman detailed a man to tell the woman of her misfortune. But break the news gently, he said. She thinks a lot of this dog.\nThe man rapped on the mansion door\nand when the woman appeared he said: Sorry lady, but part of your dog has been run over.\n289\nLove.\nThere is no use for artificial and outward discipline – the inner and natural discipline is enough.\nBut what is the inner discipline? In one word: ACCEPTANCE – total acceptance.\nAnd acceptance can be only total\nbecause partial acceptance is just a contradiction in terms.\nIf you live – live!\nIf you die – die!\nIf you suffer – suffer!\nAnd then there is no problem and no anxiety\nand no anguish – and what FREEDOM!\nA Zen Master was once asked:\nIt is terribly hot, how shall we escape it Why not go, answered the Master,\nto the place where it is neither – neither hot nor cold?\nWhere is that place?\nAnd then the Master laughed and said:\nIN SUMMER WE SWEAT AND IN WINTER WE SHIVER.\n290\nLove.\nHow can a man learn to know himself? enquires Goethe, and then answers:\nNever by reflection but only by action. John Burroughs doubts this.\nHe says:\nIs not this a half-truth?\nBecause one can only learn his powers of action by action and his powers of thought by thinking.\nBut I say that\nman is always more than all his actions and all his thoughts, and unless that MORE is known no one knows himself.\nThat MORE can be known neither by action nor by reflection because they both belong to the periphery\nand that MORE IS eternally the centre.\nIt can only be known witnessing action and thought both: not BY them but by witnessing them.\nAnd witnessing IS meditation. 291\nLove.\nThere is no answer to man’s ultimate questions because the questions are absurd,\nand moreover there is no one to answer them.\nExistence is silent and has always been so, so do not ask\nbut be silent and live it and know it. because there is no knowing except living. The search for answers is meaningless.\nA patient in a mental hospital\nplaced his ear to the wall of his room, listening intently. Quiet, he whispered to an orderly and pointed to the wall. The attendant pressed his ear against the wall,\nlistened, and then said: I don’t hear anything. No, replied the patient.\nIt’s awful, it’s been this way always! 292\nLove.\nThe mind lives in a logical somnambulism, and it feeds on arguments and words.\nYou cannot come out of it gradually or logically\nor rationally,\nrather TAKE THE JUMP, illogical and irrational –\nand the jump can be nothing else than that.\nIt cannot be calculated or conceptualized\nor predetermined\nbecause it is going into the unknown and the uuchartered\nand the unpredictable,\nand ultimately not only into the unknown but into the unknowable also.\n293\nLove.\nMeditation cannot be taught directly because it is not a mechanical technique, but a living art.\nDogo had a disciple called Soshin. Soshin waited long with his Master to be taught the art of meditation.\nHe expected lessons the way a schoolboy is taught at school, but there were no special lessons coming,\nand this bewildered and disappointed the disciple. One day he said to the Master:\nIt is a long time since I came here but not a word has been given to me regarding the essence of meditation.\nDogo laughed at this heartily and said: What are you saying, my boy?\nSince your arrival\nI have ever been giving you lessons on the matter! At this the poor disciple was even more bewildered and for some time he could not think what to say.\nThen one day he gathered courage and asked again: What kind of lesson could it have been, sir?\nDogo said:\nWhen you bring me a cup of tea in the morning, I take it; when you serve me a meal, I accept it\nand when you bow to me I return it with a nod. How else do you expect to be taught in meditation?\nSoshin hung his head\nand began to think about the puzzling words of the Master, but at this the Master said again:\nIf you want to see, SEE, RIGHT AT ONCE, because when you begin to think\nyou miss the point altogether. 294\nLove.\nMeditate, pray and wait.\nDo not will anything,\nfor in you there is strength greater than any strength of your own.\nBut it works only when your will is at rest. 295\nLove.\nBe free at the centre;\nlet the centre relax and die:\nbe a circumference only –\nand this is the only renunciation I know.\nNo man is free until he is free at the centre. When he lets go then he is free indeed – and then life is not anguish\nand then life is not agony\nbecause no hell can exist without the self, the centre. 296\nLove.\nDo you hear me?\nDo you see me?\nI stand at the door and knock,\nand I block because of a promise made in another life and another age\n297\nLove.\nBe in the crowd as if you are alone and vice versa.\nReceive a guest with the same attitude you have when alone,\nand when alone\nmaintain the same attitude you have in receiving guests. In this way the drop drops into the ocean.\nUpon retiring, sleep as if you have entered your last sleep, and upon awakening be reborn again.\nIn this way the ocean drops into the drop. 298\nLove.\nEmptiness is not really emptiness: rather, it is the All.\nIt is not negative:\nrather, it is positivity itself\nIt is out of it that everything is born and to it everything returns.\nIt is the source and ground of all existence. So whenever I say EMPTINESS\nI never mean just emptiness!\nTo me emptiness is not the absence of anything but the presence of emptiness itself:\nAnd now you can understand it because you yourself are in it, and it is in you.\nOnce a student asked Joshu: Sir, you teach that we must empty our minds,\nbut I have nothing in my mind;\nnow what shall I do?\nThe old Master laughed and said: Throw it out!\nBut I have nothing. How can I throw it out? If you can’t throw it out, carry it out!\nDrive it out!\nEmpty it out!\nBut don’t stand there in front of me with nothing in your mind!\n299\nLove.\nCome here whenever it is possible. You will always be welcomed.\nAnd stay with me a little longer, and let me help.\nIt will be difficult for you\nbecause you will have to let go of yourself completely.\nBut it is not impossible – and with you especially\nbecause I have seen in you the great potential that is awaiting its opportunity.\nWith you much that is impossible is possible. The seed is there which is longing to explode.\nIts very longing is the source of your search, its longing is the tension that you are today and its longing will be the freedom\nthat you will be tomorrow.\nThe essence is there and the existence will follow if you so wish.\nPlease follow its call to the conclusion. Go on doing meditation.\nDo not seek results,\nthey will come by themselves when the time is ripe.\nAnd the time is ripe but still you are not.\nLet meditation ripen you. 300\nLove.\nLife is non-fragmentary,\nbut mind makes it appear fragmentary;\nand this fragmentation creates all the problems.\nBeware of fragments\nand always look beyond them and below them\nand through them –\nthen you will be able to see the ocean in spite of all the waves. The waves are in the ocean\nbut the waves are not the ocean.\nThe ocean can be without the waves\nbut the waves cannot be without the ocean. 301\nLove.\nMind means duality\nand meditation, oneness.\nIn Zen they call it – THE ONE SWORD.\nKusunoki Masashige came to a Zen monastery when he was about to meet the overwhelming army of Ashikaga Takanji and asked the Master:\nWhen a man is at the parting of the ways between life and death how should he behave?\nThe Master answered: Cut off your dualism\nand let THE ONE SWORD stand serenely by itself against the sky!\n302\nLove.\nThe real thing is\nnot to fight with your thoughts or desires or instincts\nbecause that is negative\nand the negative cannot help. The real thing is\nto grow in awareness in meditation\nbecause then one wins without any fight whatsoever – and to win through conflict is not a real victory because that which has been suppressed\nwill have to be suppressed again and again. Through conflict there is no end to conflict and through fight only more fight is born.\nBut there is a victory\nwithout any conflict, fight or suppression.\nThat victory comes through positive growth in awareness.\nDo not fight with yourself\nbut grow in awareness and understanding and silence, and all that is negative and diseased\nwill have withered away by itself. Suzuki tells a story:\nChi Hsing Tzu was raising a fighting cock for his lord. Ten days passed and the lord asked:\nIs he ready? Chi answered:\nNo sir, he is not ready.\nHe is still vain and flushed with rage.\nAnother ten days passed and the prince asked about the cock.\nChi said: Not yet, sir.\nHe is on the alert whenever he sees the shadow of\nanother cock\nor hears its crowing.\nStill another ten days passed\nand when the inquiry came from the prince, Chi replied: Not quite yet, sir.\nHis sense of fighting is still smouldering within him ready to be awakened.\nWhen another ten days elapsed\nChi replied in response to the inquiry:\nHe is almost ready.\nEven when he hears another crowing he shows no excitement. He has now become positive.\nHe has grown in subtle inner awareness.\nNow he resembles one made of wood, he is so quiet and silent. His qualities are integrated.\nNo cock is his match\nand to win he will not have to fight\nbecause other cocks will at once run away from him. They cannot face him now.\nAnd really it proved so.\nHe won fights without fighting at all.\nAud I say that you can do likewise with yourself: learn the secret from Chi Hsing Tzu’s cock!\n303\nLove.\nEverything has happened as it should happen.\nAnd l was surprised not because you ran away from here but because I never thought you could be so predictable!\nIt is not from here that you have escaped\nit is only a vain effort to escape from yourself: Which is impossible.\nHow can one escape from oneself?\nBut in meditation a moment comes necessarily when the mind tries the impossible –\nor the mind this is the last defensive act. Meditation is ultimately suicidal to the mind.\nAnd of course the mind must be given a chance! And you have given it!\nMeditation is encountering yourself directly and in your total nakedness.\nThis creates fear and the futile effort to escape.\nThe effort is futile because whatsoever is known once is known for ever\nand you cannot be the old ignorant one again.\nThere is no way to go back and there is no bridge.\nThis escape too will make you more mature and you will come back strengthened through it\nand because of it.\nNow relax there under the sky and beside the sea and I will be there.\nWhenever you are relaxed you will feel my presence. And when you feel like coming, come back –\nnd soon you will feel this.\nI will be waiting here for you as ever.\nCOME and recontinue the arduous journey towards your self.\n304\nLove.\nI know that the apprenticeship is very hard but worth it.\nSo keep on.\nIt is arduous, but one has to pay for everything,\nand in no other way can you get to THE GREAT TREASURE.\nYou have longed for it for lives and lives\nand now when the time is ripe and the key is being given to you DO NOT LOSE COURAGE.\nThe access to the treasure is difficult\nbecause it is hidden in our own unconscious layers of the mind.\nIt will be easy if you approach that threshold when the diurnal tide favours,\nthat is when you are passing from sleep to waking\nor from waking to sleep.\nEvening and morning\nare therefore probably the best times for meditation.\nYou might have noticed that when the mind\nis recovering from sleep it takes at least fifteen minutes to close one aperture and open fully the other.\nThat is why dreams cannot last longer than that in memory after waking.\nWhen the mind is approaching sleep it again passes the same threshold. BE AWARE OF THIS THRESHOLD\nbecause it is very significant\nfor those who are in search of the inner treasure. This threshold is the gate to the unknown\nThis threshold,\nthis gap between waking and sleep, must be used for meditation.\nBe aware of the gap,\nbe a witness of the interval, and you will be transformed. 305\nLove.\nI know what is happening to you – the nothingness is descending, the emptiness is increasing.\nWelcome it, and rejoice in its coming.\nDance in ecstasy because there is no other way to welcome it. And the more you dance the more you will die.\nAnd when you are dead completely you will be reborn. And the moment is near, very near – just by the corner. You have passed through the entrance-explosion and now be ready for the ultimate.\nLook at yourself once more as the river looks at itself before falling into the ocean, because after falling into the ocean there will be no one to look, and no one to be looked at!\n306\nLove.\nWhat is meditation?\nHsu Yun says: Meditation lies in laying down. But laying down what?\nLaying down yourself – because nothing less will do. Have you ever been at the bedside of a dead man? If you try to scold him he will not be excited,\nand even if you strike him with a staff he will not strike back.\nHe also indulged before in the same things everyone indulges in. He also longed for reputation and wealth.\nBut now he is just without any longing whatsoever. Now he does not make any distinctions\nand lays down everything.\nIf you cul be in this laying down state – alive, you are in meditation.\n307\nLove.\nLeave the grasping of things and thoughts.\nOpen your fist completely because grasping is suffering. Halt! cries Buddha.\nBut the mad mind does not halt. If it halts, it is Enlightenment!\n308\nLove.\nLove to be alone.\nSolitude is the temple of the divine,\nand remember that there is no other temple. 309\nLove.\nDo not be closed to the universe.\nOpen all your doors and windows\nand let everything pass freely in and out, out and in, because only then will you be able to receive the truth. 31O\nLove.\nEgo plays a subtle role everywhere – not only in men but in mice also!\nAn arrogant elephant looked down contemptuously at a mouse and said: You are just about the puniest little creature\nI have ever seen.\nI am not always like this, squeaked the mouse. I’ve been sick!\n311\nLove.\nThe whole yoga has gone dead because of imitation. One cannot imitate anything that is real,\nthe real is always spontaneous:\none can jump into it but one cannot practise it. Any practice is of the mind and by the mind – and the mind is the past, the dead;\nthe mind is the thing one has to jump out of. Out of the mind is the explosion,\nso be aware of the mind and its tricks!\nMamiya went to a great teacher to learn meditation.\nThe teacher told him to concentrate on the famous koan: What is the sound of one hand?\nMamiya went away\nand came back a week later shaking his head. He could not get it.\nGet out! said the Master. You are not trying hard enough. You still think of money and food and pleasure.\nIt would be better if you died, then you might learn the answer.\nThe next week Mamiya came back again. When the Master asked him:\nWell, what is the sound of one hand? – he clutched at his heart, groaned\nand fell down as if dead.\nWell, you have taken my advice and died, said the Master, but what about the sound?\nMamiya opened one eye:\nI have not solved that yet, he said. Dead men don’t speak, said the Master. Get up and get out!\n312\nLove.\nWe settle down where no settling is possible.\nWe make homes\nwhilst homelessness is the very nature of our consciousness. Oh, we go on doing things which are impossible and then suffer! But no one else is responsible.\nWe fight with the void and are then defeated – not because the void is stronger than us\nbut because it is not.\nNow stand up and fight with the empty space of the room so that you can know and taste\nthe whole stupidity of the human mind. And then sit down and laugh at yourself, and as the laughter dies down\nbe silent and search within,\nand then you will come to know a deep mystery: the mystery that the void is not only without\nbut within also!\n313\nLove.\nDeath is everywhere\nbut everyone deceives himself that it is not for him; this is the greatest\nand the deepest deception the human mind is capable of; and unless one is constantly aware of this fact\none is bound to be a victim of this deception – because the mind goes on giving\nvery beautiful and logical rationalizations up to the very end.\nI have heard about a ninety-year-old man\nwho got into a bitter argument with his shoemaker as to how a pair of shoes should be made.\nSee here, said the shoemaker,\nWhat’s the idea of doing so much yapping You are past ninety\nand there is little chance of your living long enough to wear these shoes out.\nThe old fellow looked sternly at the shoemaker\nand said: Apparently you are not aware that statistics prove that very few people die after ninety years of age!\n314\nLove.\nInformation is not knowledge\nbecause information is not transformation and can never be –\nand knowledge comes only through transformation. Information is adding something to the same old mind. It is quantitative;\nthere is no qualitative change\nbecause the mind behind remains the same. That is why all that is called education just proves superficial.\nMind must go through qualitative change otherwise there is no wisdom;\nand to go on adding information to ignorance is fatal. I call meditation\nthe method for mind’s total mutation\nFirst let there be a transformation of the very quality of the mind\nand only then education can be educative.\nIn ancient times\nthe king of a certain country was concerned because his son was something of a fool.\nThe king’s counsellors urged that the son be sent away to a great university in another land\nin the hope that the boy would acquire learning and wisdom.\nThe king agreed.\nThe son studied hard for several years then wrote his father that he had learned just about everything possible\nand pleaded to be allowed to return home. The king assented.\nWhen the son arrived at the palace the king was overjoyed.\nA great feast was prepared\nand all the great men of the kingdom were invited.\nAt the end of the festivities\none of the sages present asked the son what he had learned.\nThe young man ticked off the university’s curriculum that he had gone through. While the lad was talking\nthe sage slipped a ring off his finger, closed his hand over it,\nheld up his hand and asked: What do I hold in my hand? The son though for a moment and said;\nIt is a round object with a hole in the centre. The sage was astonished at such wisdom. Maybe the lad had become a great mind.\nWill you now name the object? asked the sage.\nThe king’s son pondered for a few moments, then said:\nThe sciences that I studied do not aid me in answering your question,\nbut my own commonsense tells me that it is a cartwheel.\nThe sage concluded to himself\nthat you can educate a fool but you cannot make him think.\n315\nLove.\nYes, there is a WAY,\nbut in many the will is lacking to find it. And it is not far away,\nit is just by the corner, so to say.\nKnowingly or unknowingly all men long for it. Really, the whole life is a longing for it because without it\nthere is no reaching, no flowering, no fulfilment.\nBut few men seek it\nand still fewer seek it rightly and still fewer find it –\nand all of those who find it do not enter.\nOnly a few enter\nand still fewer progressively follow it.\nBut those who follow it with their total being realize that the way is the goal itself!\n316\nLove.\nMind and meditation are two names of the same substance, or the same energy.\nMind is energy flowing in dualisms, in conflict and dis-ease,\nand meditation is non-dual energy, one with itself and at case.\nThinking is impossible without dualisms,\nthat is why meditation asks to go beyond thinking. The moment there is no thinking –\nor a single ripple of thought – the energy becomes integrated and there is qualitative change. The no-thinking energy\nopens the door of the dimensionless dimension.\nSo refrain from seeking even Enlightenment or Buddhahood because with any seeking whatsoever\nhe mechanism of thought begins to operate and create dualisms.\n317\nLove.\nDo not forget the search for the divine for even a single moment because the time is always short and the task is great\nand besides, the mind is wavering. In fact the mind IS the wavering.\nRemember this, and remain aware of this fact as much as you can\nbecause the moment one is aware the wavering stops, and in the intervals are the glimpses:\nglimpses of oneself, glimpses of no-mind.\nOne has to transcend the wavering of the mind absolutely before one comes to the doors of the beloved.\nNO-MINDEDNESS IS THE DOOR.\nAnd the door is not far off. But the seeker is asleep. Mind is the sleep.\nThat is why you will have to be attentive and alert of everything that passes before your\nconsciousness –\neven be attentive of the inattentive moments.\nThrough constant awareness the spiritual sleep will be broken and you will he transformed.\nThis is your potentiality.\nThis is everyone’s potentiality. and for you the time is ripe.\nBut the seed can remain a seed and die. The opportunity can be lost.\nYou are free to be that which you are meant to be or to be that which you are not meant to be.\nMan is free to be or not to be –\nthis is the glory and this is the burden. Freedom means responsibility,\nSO BE CAREFUL.\nIf you can be that which is your potentiality, if you can flower to your fullness\nthen there is bliss then there is ecstasy,\notherwise ashes are in the hands and anguish in the heart – and ultimately everything depends on you:\nheaven or hell –\nand you and only you will be responsible for it. SO BE CAREFUL.\nMy blessings are always with you. 318\nLove.\nMetaphysics is born out of childish curiosity, so howsoever sublime, it remains juvenile.\nAnd all the ultimate answers are foolish in a way\nbecause the ultimate is not only unknown, it is unknowable.\nA mature mind is one\nwho understands the impossibility of knowing the ultimate, and with this understanding\nthere is a new dimension:\nthe dimension of being.\nKnowing is not possible, but being is. Or in other word:\nin relation to the ultimate only – being is knowing.\nThis dimension is the religious dimension and unless one is religious in this sense one goes on asking absurd questions\nand accumulating even more absurd answers.\nIn a little backwoods school\nthe teacher was at the blackboard explaining arithmetic problems.\nShe was delighted to see her dullest pupil\ngiving slack-jawed attention, which was unusual for him.\nHer happy thought was that at last\nthe gangling lad was beginning to understand. When she finished she said to him:\nYOU were so interested, Cicero.\nthat I am sure you want to ask some questions. Yes’m, drawled Cicero, I got one to ask.\nWhere do those figures go when you rub them off? 319\nLove.\nDo not cling to anything, to any idea,\nbecause clinging is the bondage. Even if one is clinging to the idea of liberation –\nmoksha or nirvana, one will be in bondage.\nWith clinging meditation is impossible because clinging is mind – the bondage, and no-clinging is meditation –\nthe freedom.\nIn the BOOK OF AMU DARIA there is an old Sufi tale: Once upon a time there was a monkey\nwho was very fond of cherries.\nOne day he saw a delicious looking cherry and came down from his tree to get it,\nbut the fruit turned out to be in a clear glass bottle, so he had to put his hand into the bottle to get it out.\nAs soon as he had done so he closed his hand over the cherry but then he found\nthat he could not withdraw his fist holding the cherry because it was larger than the internal dimensions of the bottle’s neck.\nNow all this was deliberate\nbecause the cherry in the bottle was a trap laid by a monkey hunter\nwho knew how monkeys think.\nThe hunter, hearing the monkey’s whimperings, came along and the monkey tried to run away,\nbut because his hand was, as he thought, stuck in the bottle.\nhe could not move fast enough to escape.\nBut as he thought he still had hold of the cherry he consoled himself.\nThe hunter picked him up\nand tapped the monkey sharply on the elbow making him suddenly relax his hold on the fruit.\nThe monkey was now free – but he was captured.\nThe hunter had used the cherry and the bottle and he still had them.\nThis monkey-way of thinking is the mind-way also! And in the end when death, the hunter, comes everyone is found caught in his own bottle.\nRemember, before the hunter comes make sure your hand is out of the bottle! 320\nLove.\nA life without meditation is like a winter landscape with the sun hidden,\nthe flowers frozen\nand the wind whispering through the withered leaves.\nAnd everyone knows it\nbecause everyone lives it that way, though no one needs to live it that way But why is this so?\nThis is so because life’s needs require an occupied mind and meditation means unoccupiedness.\nWe train ourselves to be occupied\nand then forget that one needs to be unoccupied sometimes to know the ecstasy of sheer existence.\nOne is to be totally vacant inside\nbecause only then is one a host to the divine guest. 321\nLove.\nMeditation is beyond knowledge. You can be it but you cannot know it. All knowledge is superficial.\nIt is never anything else but acquaintance from outside.\nIt is always about\nbut never the thing itself;\nWhen the Chinese emperor Wu came to meet Bodhidharma he asked the Master:\nWhat is the holy ultimate truth? Bodhidharma laughed and replied:\nNothing holy, sir,\nand it is emptiness itself.\nOf course Wu was taken aback, but he asked again: Then who is the one who at present stands confronting me?\nBodhidharma simply said: I don’t know.\nDo you see the beauty of it? And the truth?\nAnd the innocence?\nAnd the holiness?\nAnd the fullness?\nAnd the absolute ultimateness? 322\nLove.\nIt is very easy to progress from one illusion to another because no foundational transformation is needed.\nThere is no shaking of the foundations because you remain the same.\nSo the real problem is not to change the objects of desire from the worldly to the other-worldly\nbut to transform oneself; not to change the seeking but to change the seeker –\notherwise the problem remains as it is, only it takes new shapes.\nBut how to change the seeker.\nFirst find it out – where it is and what it is.\nand then you will come to know a hidden secret: that the seeker exists only until it is not sought, and when someone goes to search it out –\nit is never found.\nIt exists only in ignorance and in darkness; in awareness it is not:\nand this realization of no-self is the jump. Jump into the unknown.\nJump into the truth.\n323\nLove.\nWhatever I say is nothing new; nor is it anything old.\nOr it is both –\nthe oldest and the newest.\nAnd to know it you need not listen to me.\nOh! Listen to the birds in the morning\nor to the flowers and grass blades in the sun and you will hear it,\nand if you do not know how to listen then you will not know from me either.\nSo the real thing is not what you listen to but HOW you listen because the message is everywhere, everywhere, everywhere. Now I will tell you the art of listening:\nroam about until exhausted or dance or do vigorous breathing and then, dropping to the ground, listen;\nor repeat your own name loudly until exhausted and then suddenly stop and listen;\nor at the point of sleep when sleep has not yet come\nand external wakefulness vanishes be alert suddenly and listen\nAND THEN YOU WILL HEAR ME. 324\nLove.\nThat which is never lost cannot be found, and to search for it is absurd.\nBut the moment this absurdity is understood all seeking stops by itself\nand that which is never lost is found! That is why I say:\nSEEK AND YOU WILL NOT FIND,\nbecause the very seeking is the barrier.\nThe search itself is the hindrance\nbecause it creates the seeker, the ego, the illusion that I am,\nand I am not.\nDo not seek and you will find it:\nthe I-AM-NOTNESS.\nThis nothingness is the gate. THE GATELESS GATE.\nRiko once asked Nansen\nto explain to him the old problem of the goose in the bottle. If a man puts a gosling into the bottle, he said,\nand feeds the gosling through the bottle’s neck until it grows and grows and becomes a goose –\nand then there is just no more room inside the bottle, how can the man get it out without killing the goose or breaking the bottle?\nRIKO! shouted Nansen, and gave a great clap with his hands.\nYes Master! said Riko with a start. See! said Nansen.\nThe goose is out!\n325\nLove.\nMeditation requires understanding and not effort, understanding is essential, not effort,\nand remember always that you cannot substitute understanding with any effort whatsoever.\nBut what do I mean by understanding?\nBy understanding I mean – living a natural life. Of course, you cannot try to be natural,\nthat is self-contradictory!\nYou can BE natural but you cannot try to be natural. Do you understand this?\nSuzuki tells a story:\nA monk once asked one of the old Chinese Masters: What is the way?\nhe Master replied:The natural one, the ordinary one, is the way.\nHow, continued the monk, am I to be in accord with it? When you try to be in accord with it, said the Master, then you deviate from it.\nDoes this mean that one should not try? No, because that too is a way of trying. – Of course, indirect, but still intentional; that too will not help.\nBut just see the dilemma clearly and you are out of it. ARE YOU, NOT?\n326\nLove and blessings. Received your letter.\nI was waiting for it daily since you left.\nI know that you have gone far away from here\nbut I also know that now you cannot go away from me – and that nearness is all that counts.\nYOU have come near to me in a nonspatial and nontemporal sense.\nThe meeting has taken place in the nowhere or in the everywhere\nbecause they both mean the same thing.\nAnd the real meeting takes place only in this way. All else is illusion.\nRemember me whenever you need and you will find me then and there.\nAsk anything and wait – and you will be answered.\nThe barriers have fallen down from your mind and you have entered the meditative state.\nNow the doors of the divine are open do not hesitate, and take the plunge. You are completely ready,\nonly just be courageous to enter the uncharted and the unknown.\nThe call from beyond has come –\nnow accept the challenge and be fulfilled.\nNow close your eyes\nand feel me and see me and let my blessings be showered on you.\n327\nLove.\nOh, don’t take life so seriously!\nBecause seriousness is a great dis-ease, and not only a disease but a suicide also. Be playful – totally\nbecause that is the only way to be living.\nLife is a play, a leela, and to know it so is religion, and to live it so is sannyas – renunciation.\nIf you can act and live as if acting and living in a dream and still be a witness to it\nthen you will be in the cosmic flow, the tao. And to be in the cosmic flow is to be free – free from oneself, the ego.\nThe ego is the seriousness, the disease,\nand the tao, the egoless existence, is the bliss, the ecstasy.\nThat is why I have given you a name so absurd! But I have given it to you knowingly.\nI have given it to you so that you may never be identified with it.\nThe name is so absurd\nthat you will have to remain nameless and nobody behind it, and the name is such that\nnot only others but you yourself will be able to laugh at it. Swami Krishna Christ!\nOh, what a name!\nBut perfectly suitable in a dream drama. is it not so\nSo feel at ease with it.\nand laugh with it, and sing and dance with it\nand be SWAMI KRISHNA CHRIST with all the letters in capital!\nAnd always remember that you are nobody.\nAnd always be aware that\nyou are neither a swami nor a Krishna nor a Christ –\nthat is what is meant by a swami! And Krishna himself is not a Krishna and Christ himself is not a Christ\nbecause they are nameless, absolutely nameless.\nThey are nobodies – and that is what makes them divine.\nThe moment one is identified with any name one is lost to one’s divinity.\nEither one can be a name or a reality, and no one can be both simultaneously. Be a name really –\nand your reality is lost.\nBe a reality really –\nand your name is just a dream – maya. And what nonsense to be a swami!\nBut once one is at ease with the no sense one transcends it.\nPlease! Don’t try to be sensible\notherwise you will never be with any sense at all! Because only stupidity tries to be sensible!\nThe existence is absurd and meaningless\nand irrational\nand that is why it is so beautiful. And to be in it such a blessing! 328\nLove.\nMan is free to decide, but not free not to decide – because not to decide is to decide,\nto waver is to decide,\nto postpone and evade decision is to decide. There is no escape:\none must say yes or no.\nAnd there are a thousand ways of saying no, only one way of saying yes,\nant no way of not saying anything at all.\nThis is the human situation\nand the seeker of truth must be aware of it otherwise life is wasted unnecessarily.\nA single moment lost cannot be regained – ant we have wasted so many lives –\nso decide to decide,\nand decide to transform and transcend. With the decision comes crystallization\nand then one is ready to take the jump into the unknown. 329\nLove.\ntraveller stops at an inn He passes the night there, takes his meal,\nand as soon as he has done so\nhe packs and continues his journey again.\nAs for the host of the inn, he has nowhere to go. The one who does not stay is the guest,\nand the one who stays is the host. Now who are you –\nthe guest or the host Meditate.\nNo answer is required, rather – REALIZE.\nbecause all answers belong to the guest and realization only to the host.\nBut do not believe me, I may be just deceiving you. Go in and find out for yourself!\n330\nLove.\nMeditation is the masterkey.\nIt can open the doors of the infinite\nand it can unlock the mystery of the unknown.\nBut just by possessing the key nothing is attained, unless one uses it.\nIdries Shah tells a dervish tale:\nThere was once a wise and very rich man who had a son. He said to him:\nMy son, here is a jewelled ring.\nKeep it is a sign that you are a successor of mine and pass it down to your posterity.\nIt is of value, of fine appearance,\nand it has the added capacity of opening a certain door to wealth.\nSome years later he had another son.\nWhen he was old enough\nthe wise man gave him another ring with the same advice.\nThe same thing happened in the case of his third and last son.\nWhen the Ancient had died and the sons grew up one after the other each claimed primacy for himself because of his possession of one of the rings.\nNobody could tell for certain which was the most valuable. Each son gained his adherents,\nall claiming a greater value and beauty for his own ring.\nBut the curious thing was that\nthe door to wealth remained shut for the possessors of the keys and even their closest supporters.\nThey were all too preoccupied with the problem of precedence, the possession of the ring, its value and appearance.\nOnly a few looked for the door to the treasury of the Ancient. The rings had a magical quality too.\nAlthough they were keys\nthey were not used directly in opening the door to the treasury.\nIt was sufficient to look upon them\nwithout contention or too much attachment to one or other of their qualities.\nWhen this had been done the people who had looked\nwere able to tell where the treasury was\nand could open it merely by producing the outline of the ring. The treasuries had another quality too:\nthey were inexhaustible.\nMeanwhile the partisans of the three rings repeated the tales of their ancestors about the merits of the rings,\neach in a slightly different way.\nThe first community thought they had already found the treasure because they had the key.\nThe second thought that it was allegorical and thereby consoled themselves.\nAnd the third transferred the possibility of opening the door\nto a distant and remotely imagined future time and therefore for them there was nothing to do at present.\nThere is every possibility\nfor you also to belong to one of these three communities because anyone who begins to search\nis always prone to fall into the trap of any one of the three. Really, these are the three basic tricks the mind can play to save itself from meditation\nSo beware of these old tricks. 331\nLove.\nLook at yourself without thinking, evaluating, or judging, without any liking or disliking;\nthat is, without any movement of the mind or without the noise of the mind:\nthen you have eyes\nwhich are altogether different from your eyes because they are not burdened by the past. They are innocent and silent,\nand in this silence\nthere is neither the observer nor the observed – but that which is,\nundivided and one, beginningless and endless.\nYou can call it God or nirvana or anything whatsoever –\nthe name does not matter because the name is not the thing, and when one has known the thing\none does not bother about the value. 332\nLove.\nBegin the following meditation from tomorrow – and know that this is an order!\nNow you are so mine\nthat I cannot do anything else but order! Prerequirements:\nDo it cheerfully. Do it relaxedly. Be playful.\nDo it in the morning after taking a bath. The meditation:\nFirst: breathe deeply and rhythmically, not fast\nbut slowly,\nfor ten minutes.\nSecond: dance rhythmically and slowly; be ecstatic, as if flowing in it:\nfor ten minutes.\nThird: use the mahamantra: hoo-hoo-hoo; continue dancing and moving;\ndo not be serious, do not be tense; for ten minutes.\nFourth: close the eyes and be silent; do not move or dance now;\nstand, sit or lie town, as you feel to do, but just be as if dead,\nfeel sinking in,\nsurrender and be in the hands of the whole; for ten minutes.\nPostrequirements:\nOne: live the whole day in ecstasy. in intoxication of the divine, flowing and flowering in it,\nand whenever depressed say inwardly: hoo-hoo-hoo, and laugh outwardly,\nlaugh without any reason, and accept the madness. Two: before sleep chant the mahamantra: hoo-hoo-hoo\nfor ten minutes,\nthen laugh at yourself.\nThree: in the morning as you feel awake chant again the mahamantra: hoo-hoo-hoo for ten minutes,\nand then begin the day with a hearty laugh. Four: remember always that I am with you. 333\nLove.\nEVERYTHING BELONGS TO THE MAN WHO WANTS NOTHING.\nHaving nothing, he possesses all things in life: renouncing all he becomes the master of all. But why?\nBecause into his emptiness enters the divine. 334\nLove.\nLive humbly and in wonder\nand then meditation comes of itself. Relax, and there is ecstasy.\nBut effort is needed\nbecause unless this fails completely you will not be effortless!\n335\nLove.\nBe aware or the mind BEFORE it is stirred by a thought, or, be aware of the gap between two thoughts,\nand – you will meet yourself!\nAnd this meeting is the meeting with the divine. 336\nLove.\nBuddha says: If the mind does not arise all things are blameless.\nWhat more is there to be said:\nAnd even this much is enough to blame everything! 337\nLOVE.\nThe eyes are blind. One must look within the heart. So do not believe the eyes,\nbelieve the heart\nand remember to look through it,\nand then you will come to know things unbelievable. And unless one comes to know the unbelievable one has not known at all.\n338\nLove.\nRemember always the one who is inside the body. Walking, sitting, eating or doing anything, remember the one who is neither walking nor sitting\nnor eating.\nAll doing is on the surface\nand beyond all doing is the being;\nso be aware of the nondoer in the doing. of the nonmover in the moving.\nOne day Mulla Nasrudin’s wife, hearing a tremendous thump. ran to his room.\nNothing to worry about, said the Mulla.\nIt was only my cloak which fell to the ground. What! And made a noise like that? asked his wife Yes – I was inside it at the time, said the Mulla.\n339\nLove.\nA monk asked Daishu Ekai, What is nirvana? The Master answered: Not to commit oneself to the vicious circle of birth and death or pleasure and pain\nis great nirvana,\nWhat then is the vicious circle\nof birth and death and pleasure and pain? The Master said:\nTo desire nirvana!\nNow be silent and feel what is meant by to desire nirvana,\nand remember that I am not saying think about it because to think is to miss it.\nFEEL IT. FEEL IT. FEEL IT. 340\nLove.\nIn this world everything is upside down and anyone who is meditating\nwill have to put everything right side up!\nOne should not try to know life but to know death, and then the mysteries of life are revealed to him.\nOne should not ask for any security and then there is no insecurity at all. Bunan says in a poem:\nWhile living\nbe a dead man, be thoroughly dead and then behave as you like because then all is well\n341\nLove.\nMaterialistic societies produce hollow men, men with dead emptiness within,\nand because of this dead emptiness\none dies before one is really born.\nRemember that man cannot live by shops alone, and today the holy of holies is the shop.\nThe outer is meaningless without the inner richness and the outer richness\nonly makes the inner poverty prominent.\nMan is hollow because there is no inner growth\nand the inner grows only when one lives in the inner. Inward is the way of growth, grace and God.\n342\nLove.\nNever suppress any thought, or fight with it.\notherwise you will never be without it. Fight it, and you invite it more.\nSuppress it, and it will be back with double force.\nI have heard\nthat someone advertised something for women but with the heading, ONLY FOR MEN,\nand it is reported that\nout of ninety thousand women who came across it eighty-nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-four read the advertisement.\nThe other six were blind.\n343\nLove.\nIt is impossible to conceive of the divine intellectually, and that is why the intellect denies it\nor fabricates fictitious systems about it,\nwhich is even more dangerous than plain denial. The mind works only in the circle of the known; it cannot transcend the world of the known:\nfor the mind the unknown is not.\nSays Attar: You know nothing of your real self here and in this state.\nYou are like the wax in the honeycomb – what does it know of fire or guttering?\nBut when it gets to the stage of the waxen candle and when light is emitted\nTHEN IT KNOWS. 344\nLove.\nLife is not a detective story,\nand you do not have to deduce a thing. Life is before your eyes as clear as the sun and as open as the sky.\nJust be out of your thinking, disease and open your eyes\nand nothing is hidden at all.\nEven the hidden one is not hidden then.\nI have heard a dialogue between Sherlock Holmes and Watson:\nHolmes: Ah Watson. I see you have put on your winter underwear.\nWatson: Marvellous, Holmes, marvellous! How did you ever deduce that?\nHolmes: Well, you have forgotten to put on your trousers.\n345\nLove.\nLife goes on flowing.\nIt does not wait.\nBut mind thinks and therefore takes time. To exist, no time is needed,\nbut to think – time is necessary Really there is no time existence.\nit appears only because of the mind and its thinking\nExistence exists not in time but in eternity. It exists in the eternal now.\nThere is neither past nor future But only the present –\nor not even that\nbecause without the past and future it is meaningless to call it present Do not live out or the mind.\notherwise you will always lag behind.\nbecause life never waits for you and your so-called mind\nthat is why the mind always feels as if something is missing – because it is missing life itself – and always!\nOnce a Master said to his disciples:\nIf you utter a word – thirty blows of my stick for you, but if you utter no words\njust the same, thirty blows of my stick Now – SPEAK. SPEAK!\nOne disciple came forward\nand when he was about to bow before the Master he was struck\nThe disciple protested :I have not uttered a single word and neither did you allow me not to utter.\nWhy the striking ?\nThe Master laughed and said\nIf I wait for you and your speech or your silence... it is too late and life cannot wait!\n346\nLove.\nGoethe is said to have cried when dying:\nLight, light, more light!\nAnd Miguel Unamuno has responded with his:\nNo – warmth, warmth, more warmth! For we die of cold and not of darkness!\nBut I say to you that we die neither because of cold nor because of darkness\nbut because of our lust for living or because of our fear of death –\nwhich is to say the same thing in different terms.\nDo not look at death as opposite to life, because it is not. And live death moment to moment,\ndo not postpone it for the end because that creates fear.\nDie each moment to the past,\nand then each moment you will be fresh, young and reborn.\nAnd then there is light always\nbecause the very darkness becomes light, and warmth also,\nbecause only the dead past is cold. THE PRESENT IS ALWAYS WARM. 347\nLove.\nMan is not the end\nbut only the means\nMan is not really a being but only a tension\nbetween two planes of being. Man is a bridge only,\nthat is why man cannot remain satisfied with himself. His heart is nothing but a continent of discontent and his very being is anguish.\nReligion is the wish to pass beyond himself as he now is. That is why I say man can never be irreligious;\nthat is impossible;\nhe can pretend to be but he cannot be.\nReligion is not something accidental or circumstantial, it is in the very nature of man.\nMan is a religious animal\nand man is nothing if man is not a desire to transcend himself.\nHe can go below himself, or he can go above\nbut he cannot remain himself. He cannot be rest.\nThat is why there is restlessness 348\nLove.\nUse dreaming consciously as meditation\nand know well that conscious dreaming opens new doors of perception.\nLie down, relax;\nand dream but do not fall asleep; remain conscious in the background; wait and watch;\ndream anything that happens to your mind: do not plan beforehand;\ndream anything because in dream the whole world is yours; dream your existence as you please;\ndream and be content,\ncontent with your dreams because they are yours,\nand remember that nothing can be yours like your dreams because you yourself are a dream entity! –\nand also because your wishes come to be true in your dreams, and only in your dreams.\nBut do not fall into identification. Be a witness.\nRemain aware.\nAnd then suddenly there will be no dreaming.\nOnly you\nand illumination.\n349\nLove.\nYou write me that without me you cannot pass through the gate\nand with me you will not pass through the gate. Oh, I know that!\nBut you need not do either.\nYou need not pass through the gate with me or not with me,\nbecause I am the gate.\nI am no-one, so how can you be with me or not with me?\nAnd only one who is no-one can be the gate.\nThe gate means the emptiness\nbecause the gate is nothing but the space to pass through.\nPass through me – not with me –\nand know.\nI appear to be someone only from without,\nbut the deeper you penetrate me the less you will find me.\nAnd in the end – NO-ONE. 350\nLove.\nWalk as if you are not walking, stand as if you are not standing, sit as if you are not sitting –\nand then\nyou will begin to feel something completely new arising within you.\nThis is the real one.\nThe false you walks, stands and sits\nand the real you just remains in suchness. FEEL THIS – THIS VERY MOMENT,\nbecause there is no need to postpone it,\n\u003c Previous | Contents\n","wordCount":"47327","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/a_cup_of_tea/part1/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/a_cup_of_tea/>A Cup of Tea</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">1</h1><div class=post-meta>223 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;47327 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/A_Cup_of_Tea/part1.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=_index>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a></p><p><span id=bookmark0>‌</span>CHAPTER <span class=s3>1</span></p><p><br></p><p>¡b¿Also called Flowers of Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Letters 151 to 350 are published in other books: The Silent Music

drowned in a deep silence!</p><p>I speak, I work,</p><p><br></p><p>but I am steeped in emptiness within.</p><p><br></p><p>2</p><p>There, there is no movement.</p><p><br></p><p>Thus I seem to be living two lives at one time. What a drama!</p><p>But perhaps all of life is a drama</p><p><br></p><p>and becoming aware of this opens the door to a unique freedom.</p><p>That which is inaction in action stillness in motion eternity in
change – that is truth</p><p>and that is existence.</p><p><br></p><p>Real life lies in this eternity –</p><p><br></p><p>everything else is just the stream of dreams.</p><p><br></p><p>In truth the world is just a dream</p><p><br></p><p>and the question is not whether to leave these dreams or not,</p><p>one just has to be aware of them.</p><p><br></p><p>With this awareness, everything changes. The centre moves.</p><p>A shift takes place from body to soul. And what is THERE?</p><p>It cannot be told.</p><p><br></p><p>It has never been told</p><p>and it never will be!</p><p><br></p><p>There is no other way but to know it for oneself.</p><p><br></p><p>Death is known only through dying</p><p><br></p><p>and truth is known only through diving deep within oneself.</p><p>May God drown you in this truth! 2</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>I am in bliss.</p><p><br></p><p>I have been meaning to write for a long time but many engagements
prevented me.</p><p>My blessings, however, I send every day. Life is a sadhana;</p><p>the more you involve yourself in it the more divine it becomes.</p><p>The light is hidden in the darkness, truth is hidden,</p><p>and from THIS comes the joy of searching. I remember the words of a
rishi:</p><p>TRUTH IS HIDDEN UNDER A GOLDEN LID.</p><p><br></p><p>The golden lid that hides truth is nothing but our mind.</p><p>The mind has smothered us; we are in it,</p><p>we identify with it,</p><p><br></p><p>therefore the suffering comes,</p><p><br></p><p>the bondage and the chain of rebirths. Rise above it,</p><p>become aware that you are distinct from it – that alone brings
bliss,</p><p>that alone is freedom</p><p><br></p><p>and the end of birth and death. We have to be what we truly are:</p><p>this is the only sadhana.</p><p><br></p><p>It is the frustration of living through desires that brings this
sadhana.</p><p>Become alert about desire</p><p><br></p><p>and non-attachment begins to appear. This is not to be made to
happen,</p><p>it follows naturally from awareness of attachment.</p><p><br></p><p>Each one of us has to become aware of his attachments, and keep being
so!</p><p>Nothing should be done unconsciously.</p><p><br></p><p>If this is remembered</p><p><br></p><p>one day a totally new kind of revolution takes place in our
consciousness.</p><p>God is leading you towards this revolution – this I know.</p><p>3</p><p><br></p><p>My respects to you.</p><p><br></p><p>I was extremely pleased to get your letter.</p><p><br></p><p>So far I have not written anything</p><p><br></p><p>but a meditation centre has started here where some friends are
experimenting.</p><p>When I have some definite results</p><p><br></p><p>there is every possibility of my writing something.</p><p><br></p><p>About my experiments on myself, I am sure and certain, but I want to
test their usefulness to others.</p><p>I do not want to write anything in the manner of philosophy, my
outlook is scientific.</p><p>I want to say something about yoga based on certain psychological</p><p>and para-psychological experiments.</p><p><br></p><p>There are many illusory notions held about it and these have to be
refuted.</p><p>Therefore I am experimenting here also.</p><p><br></p><p>It is clear to me</p><p><br></p><p>that this work is not for promoting any group or cause. If you ever
come here we can talk more about all this. 4</p><p>My respects to you.</p><p><br></p><p>I am grateful for your affectionate letter.</p><p>You are meditating – that is a matter for joy. Drop all ideas of
achieving in meditation, just do it naturally;</p><p>what happens, happens on its own.</p><p><br></p><p>One day, effortlessly, everything starts happening by itself.</p><p>Effort does not lead to meditation, in fact it is a hindrance.</p><p>In effort, practice, study, there is tension.</p><p>Any expectation,</p><p><br></p><p>even the expectation of peace, brings restlessness.</p><p>The tension has to go. As soon as this happens a divine peace sets
in.</p><p>Stop feeling: I AM DOING IT;</p><p><br></p><p>realize instead: I LEAVE MYSELF IN THE HANDS OF THAT-WHICH-IS.</p><p><br></p><p>Surrender,</p><p><br></p><p>surrender yourself completely;</p><p><br></p><p>as soon as you do this, emptiness comes. Breathing and the body are
becoming relaxed, you say.</p><p>This will happen with the mind too.</p><p>When the mind goes</p><p><br></p><p>what takes place is indescribable.</p><p><br></p><p>I know that this is going to happen to you both. Just go on naturally
and without purpose.</p><p>Soon I shall be there,</p><p><br></p><p>until then, go on quietly with what I have told you to do.</p><p>My respects to all.</p><p><br></p><p>Write whenever you feel like it. I am in complete bliss.</p><p>5</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>It is through God’s grace</p><p><br></p><p>that you are working towards the discovery of the inner light.</p><p>That light is definitely there</p><p><br></p><p>and once it is met all darkness in life disappears.</p><p><br></p><p>Each step taken within</p><p><br></p><p>peels away the darkness layer by layer unfolding a world of light in
which everything is new.</p><p>This experience cuts away all bondage –</p><p><br></p><p>and then comes the realization that it was never there!</p><p>Liberation happens to that which is eternally free! I am pleased with
your progress.</p><p>Your letter was received long back</p><p><br></p><p>but as I was busy there was delay in replying, but my memory of you
is always there,</p><p>along with all those eager for the light.</p><p><br></p><p>My good wishes flow for ever towards them. We have to keep going.</p><p>Many times one becomes disheartened on the path but ultimately the
thirsty pilgrim reaches the</p><p>spring.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact the water is there before the thirst. My kind regards to
all.</p><p>6</p><p><br></p><p>My respects to you.</p><p><br></p><p>I was away, but your letter followed me here. I am pleased to have
it.</p><p>I see life as full of bliss.</p><p><br></p><p>Ordinarily, we do not have the eyes to see this and so are deprived
of it,</p><p>but this seeing can be created.</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps it is not correct to say it can be created; it is already
there,</p><p>it is only a matter of opening the eyes,</p><p>and then – everything changes. Meditation achieves this.</p><p>Meditation means: peace; emptiness.</p><p><br></p><p>This emptiness is there but is concealed by the flow of thoughts.</p><p>As thoughts cease it comes into view.</p><p><br></p><p>It seems difficult to become free of thoughts but it is very
simple.</p><p>The mind seems very restless but it can easily settle.</p><p>The key to this transcendence is witnessing. One has to be a
witness,</p><p>an observer of the mind. One has to watch it,</p><p>just watch it.</p><p><br></p><p>The moment the witness state dawns,</p><p><br></p><p>that very moment one becomes free of thoughts.</p><p><br></p><p>This in turn opens the door to bliss</p><p><br></p><p>and then this very world changes into a new world altogether.</p><p>Keep meditating.</p><p><br></p><p>Results will come slowly.</p><p><br></p><p>You are not to worry about that, their coming is certain.</p><p>My kind regards to all.</p><p><br></p><p>7</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a long time since I received your letter. I am happy that you
long for peace –</p><p>but drop this idea that you are way behind. Nobody is lagging
behind.</p><p>It is just a matter of turning in – and the drop becomes the ocean.
Actually the drop IS the ocean but it does not know it –</p><p>that is the only separation.</p><p><br></p><p>In the emptiness of meditation even this separation goes.</p><p>Meditation is the centre of life’s sadhana.</p><p><br></p><p>The thought process will slow down</p><p><br></p><p>and in its place will come peace and emptiness.</p><p><br></p><p>When thoughts vanish</p><p><br></p><p>the seer, the witness, becomes visible</p><p><br></p><p>and the complex of the unconscious disappears. This complex is the
cause of bondage.</p><p>In the beginning it appears as hard as stone but the seeker who
practises patiently</p><p>finds one day that it was just a dream,</p><p>a puff of air.</p><p><br></p><p>May the seed of your meditation blossom into the flower of SAMADHI!
My kind regards to all.</p><p>The rest when we meet.</p><p><br></p><p>8</p><p><br></p><p>My respects to you.</p><p><br></p><p>Moving around for the whole of May affected my health so all
programmes for June: Bombay, Calcutta, Jaipur, were cancelled.</p><p>I am glad to hear you are experimenting with SAMADHI YOGA.</p><p>Don’t worry about results, just be with the experimenting.</p><p>The return is bound to come one day – not gradually but all of a
sudden, effortlessly, without</p><p>one’s knowing, it happens. Within a moment life becomes wonderfully
different!</p><p>I am not writing anything on Bhagwan Mahavir at the moment. There is
no urge whatsoever in me to write. But if you persuade me it is a
different thing! Everything</p><p>else is fine. 9</p><p>Love</p><p>I read your letter on the way here. It has touched my heart.</p><p>If your desire to know life’s truth becomes strong then what is
longing today</p><p>becomes one day the attainment. Burning desire is all that is needed
and nothing else.</p><p>As rivers seek out the ocean</p><p><br></p><p>so man if he wants to can find the truth. No peak, no mountain can
stop him,</p><p>in fact their challenge awakens his sense of adventure.</p><p>Truth is within everyone. Rivers have to find the ocean but our ocean
is inside us –</p><p>it is a wonder that so many remain thirsty yet without it.</p><p>Actually they cannot really want it.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a saying of Christ’s: Ask and ye shall be given.</p><p>But if you don’t ask, whose fault is it?</p><p><br></p><p>There is no better bargain than the attainment of God.</p><p>We have only to ask, nothing more.</p><p>As the asking grows stronger and stronger so he who asks starts
vanishing.</p><p>A limit is reached,</p><p><br></p><p>a point of evaporation is reached, where the seeker utterly
disappears and only the asking remains.</p><p>This is the very moment of attainment. Truth is where the I is not
–</p><p>this experience alone is the divine experience. Absence of ego is
presence of God.</p><p>My regards to all there. 10</p><p>My respects to you.</p><p><br></p><p>I was waiting for your letter when it came. I really want your life
to be filled with light, for you to surrender yourself to God.</p><p>God and light are always close by.</p><p><br></p><p>it is only a matter of opening one’s eyes and then what is ours
becomes ours.</p><p>The distance is just that between the eyelash and the eye –</p><p>and perhaps not even that much;</p><p><br></p><p>the eyes are always open only we don’t know it. There is an old
story:</p><p>A fish had long heard stories about the ocean.</p><p><br></p><p>She began to fret about it</p><p><br></p><p>so one day she asked the Queen of Fishes: What is this ocean and
where is it?</p><p>The Queen was surprised. She said:</p><p><br></p><p>The ocean? Why, you are in the very ocean itself! Your very
existence, your very life, is in the ocean.</p><p>It is within you</p><p><br></p><p>The ocean is your everything,</p><p><br></p><p>but for the ocean, you are nothing.</p><p><br></p><p>For this very reason</p><p><br></p><p>the fish couldn’t see the ocean!</p><p><br></p><h2 id=and-for-this-very-reason-we-are-unable-to-find-god.-but-he-can-be-found>And
for this very reason we are unable to find God. But He can be found</h2><p>by being empty.</p><p><br></p><p>In the state of emptiness we meet Him for God is emptiness.</p><p>I am in bliss, or shall I say –</p><p>Bliss alone is and I am not! 11</p><p>My respects to you.</p><p>I received your letter, I was waiting for it. The trip to Rajnagar
was blissful.</p><p>Religion robbed of the spirit of yoga has become a matter of morality
only, thereby losing its soul.</p><p>Morality is negative.</p><p><br></p><p>Life cannot be based on negation, negation cannot nourish life.</p><p>The emphasis has to be on attainment not on renunciation.</p><p>It is not a question of renouncing ignorance but of attaining
understanding,</p><p>it is this that has to be central.</p><p><br></p><p>Practise has to be positive</p><p><br></p><p>and this sadhana can happen through yoga. In my talks with Acharya
Tulsi, Muni Shri Nathamaljee and others</p><p>I have stressed this point.</p><p><br></p><p>Many letters have come from Rajnagar and Rajasthan in this
connection; as you have said</p><p>it seems some fruitful work has been accomplished by going there.</p><p>One thing is very clear:</p><p><br></p><p>people are eager for a spiritual life and current forms of religion
do not satisfy them.</p><p>If however the right religion is given to them it can revolutionize
human consciousness. I think of you.</p><p>May God grant you peace. My love and regards to all. 12</p><p>My respects to you.</p><p><br></p><p>All your letters arrived in good time</p><p><br></p><p>but as I have been busy I could not reply sooner.</p><p><br></p><p>I have been out most of the time</p><p><br></p><p>and I have just returned after speaking in Jaipur,</p><p><br></p><p>Burhanpur, Hoshangabad, Chanda and other places.</p><p>How thirsty people are for spiritual life! Seeing this</p><p>I am surprised that some people say man has lost all interest in
religion.</p><p>This can never be.</p><p><br></p><p>No interest in religion means no interest in life, bliss, the
ultimate.</p><p>Consciousness is by nature God-oriented and it can only be satisfied
by attaining God the state of satchitananda, the</p><p>truth-awareness-bliss state of being.</p><p>Hidden within one in the form of a seed is the very source of
religious birth, therefore whilst religions may come ant go religion can
never die.</p><p>I am glad to know that you feel patient about your progress towards
the light.</p><p>Patience is the most important thing of all in spiritual life.</p><p>How long one must wait after sowing the seed!</p><p><br></p><p>At first all the effort seems wasted, nothing seems</p><p><br></p><p>to happen, and then one day the waiting ends and there is actuality –
the seed breaks, pushes through the</p><p>earth – into a plant!</p><p><br></p><p>But remember that even when nothing seemed to be happening the seed
was working away under the soil. It is the same with the seeker for
truth – when nothing appears to be happening much is happening.</p><p>The fact is that all growth of life-energy is unseen and unknown.</p><p>Only the results can be observed not the progress. I am in bliss.</p><p>I want you to come closer to God.</p><p><br></p><p>Forget about results, just keep going on your path; let the fruits
come by themselves.</p><p>One day one wonders: What has happened!</p><p>What was I!</p><p><br></p><p>What have I become!</p><p><br></p><p>Compared to the results all the effort seems negligible.</p><p>My love to all.</p><p><br></p><p>13</p><p><br></p><p>My respects to you.</p><p><br></p><p>I have just returned from Rajnagar in Rajasthan. I was invited to a
religious function there organized by Acharya Shree Tulsi.</p><p>I put four hundred monks and nuns through an experiment in
meditation. The results were extraordinary.</p><p>In my view</p><p><br></p><p>meditation is the essence of all religious practice.</p><p>All the rest –</p><p><br></p><p>such as non-violence, renunciation of wealth, celibacy etc. – are
just its consequences.</p><p>With the attainment of samadhi, the culmination of meditation,</p><p>all these things come by themselves, they just happen naturally.</p><p>Since we forgot this central sadhana</p><p>all our efforts have been external and superficial. True sadhana IS
not just ethical,</p><p>it is basically yoga practice.</p><p><br></p><p>Ethics ALONE are negative</p><p><br></p><p>and nothing enduring can be constructed on negation.</p><p>Yoga is positive and can therefore form a base. I want to convey this
positive basis to all.</p><p>14</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>I have received your very affectionate letter. You write that my
words ring in your ears; what I want is for their echo to carry you</p><p>into that space where everything is silent, empty. This is the way
from words to emptiness.</p><p>There one meets oneself. I am in bliss.</p><p>Take my love</p><p><br></p><p>I have nothing else to offer, it is my only wealth. The marvel of it
is that the more of it you give the more it becomes.</p><p>Real wealth is like that –</p><p><br></p><p>it grows as you give it away; and if it diminishes – it is not wealth
at all.</p><p>Write again,</p><p><br></p><p>for not only do you wait for my letters, I too wait for yours.</p><p>15</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>On returning from the meditation camp I had to leave town again.</p><p>I returned only last night but I thought of you all the time.</p><p>I cannot forget the thirst for God I saw in your eyes</p><p>and the striving for truth in your heart.</p><p><br></p><p>This is a blessing because no one can attain without passing through
this anguish.</p><p>Remember, thirst is a prerequisite for the birth of light and
love.</p><p>Together, light and love are God.</p><p><br></p><p>When love has no limits its flame becomes smokeless and so
divine.</p><p>I have seen the seeds of this growth within you and it fills my soul
with great joy.</p><p>The seed is there, now it has to become a tree. It could be that the
time is at hand.</p><p>God-realization cannot happen without meditation so</p><p>you must turn towards this now with courage and perseverance.</p><p>I have great hopes – will you fulfil them? My regards to other
friends there.</p><p>I wait for your letter.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember what I said about the blank paper? Everything else is
fine.</p><p>I am in bliss. 16</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>I received your letter.</p><p><br></p><p>What you say has made me very happy.</p><p><br></p><p>Words that come out of the depth and fullness of heart echo the
infinite</p><p>just as a tiny flower expresses infinite beauty.</p><p><br></p><p>When love breathes life into words what is expressed is</p><p>not what is said</p><p><br></p><p>but what wants to be said. Inside each of us there is a poet, there
is poetry,</p><p>but because we live on the surface these are never born.</p><p>Those who go deep</p><p>awaken divine love</p><p><br></p><p>and this love fills their lives</p><p><br></p><p>with music, beauty, peace and poetry – their very lives become
music</p><p>and on to this stage truth descends. Truth will descend where there
is music so life must be turned into a melody.</p><p>Only through music can one reach the truth. You too have to become
music,</p><p>the entire life, every little act, has to be turned into music:</p><p>this happens through love. Whatever is – love it.</p><p>Feel love for the whole world. Feeling love for all with every breath
brings the inner music.</p><p>Have you ever seen this happen? See this,</p><p>fill yourself with love and see. Whatever breaks up the inner music –
that alone is irreligion, that alone is sin, and whatever fills us with
music –</p><p>that is religion, that alone is religion. Love is religion</p><p>because love is beauty, love is music.</p><p>Love is God</p><p><br></p><p>because it is all that is needed to attain Him.</p><p><br></p><p>Give my love to everybody there</p><p><br></p><p>and feel the light of my love beside you. 17</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>I have received your letter.</p><p><br></p><p>You long for the peace I have within me. It is yours any time.</p><p>It is the deepest possibility in everyone, it only has to be
uncovered.</p><p>As springs of water lie hidden under layers of earth so does bliss
lie hidden within us.</p><p>The possibility is there for everyone but only those who dig for it
can redeem it.</p><p>The excavation of these hidden treasures lies through religion.</p><p>Digging with it one reaches the well of light within.</p><p>I have shown you how to dig and what with, but the digging has to be
done by you.</p><p>I know your soil is absolutely ready, with very</p><p>little effort the infinite streams can be reached. This state of mind
is attained with the greatest good fortune so don’t waste it or miss
this opportunity.</p><p>Fill yourself with determination and leave the rest to God.</p><p>Truth runs alongside will.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t hesitate to write, I have lots of time for you.</p><p>I am for those who need me – nothing in my life is for myself.</p><p>18</p><p><br></p><p>Love,</p><p><br></p><p>so much love.</p><p><br></p><p>I received your letter when I got back.</p><p><br></p><p>I could feel the ardour of your heart through your words.</p><p>I well know the fervour that stirs your soul</p><p><br></p><p>and the thirst that turns into tears within you. I was once there
too, I too have suffered it.</p><p>I can well understand your heart because I have travelled those same
paths you now have to take in the quest for God. I too have experienced
the longing that one day turns into a raging fire in which one has
to</p><p>consume oneself.</p><p><br></p><p>But this burning brings the birth of a new life.</p><p><br></p><p>The drop can only become the ocean when it ceases to exist.</p><p>Continue your efforts in meditation;</p><p><br></p><p>you have to go deeper and deeper into it – it is the only way.</p><p>Through it and it alone call one reach life’s truth.</p><p>Remember:</p><p><br></p><p>lf you become absorbed in sadhana, fully committed and surrendered,
you are bound to reach the truth.</p><p>This is an eternal law.</p><p><br></p><p>No step taken towards God is ever wasted. My regards to all.</p><p>19</p><p><br></p><p>My respects to you.</p><p><br></p><p>Your letters were received.</p><p><br></p><p>I have just got back from a camp at Ranakpur. It was just for friends
from Rajasthan, that’s why you weren’t informed.</p><p>It lasted five days and about sixty people participated.</p><p>It was a wonderful success and it was obvious that much happened.</p><p>Encouraged by the results the organizers are planning a camp on an
all-India basis.</p><p>You must come to that.</p><p><br></p><p>I am glad to hear your meditation is progressing. You have only to be
silent.</p><p>To be silent is everything.</p><p><br></p><p>Silence does not mean absence of speech, it means absence of
thoughts.</p><p>When the mind quietens down it becomes linked to the infinite.</p><p>Don’t do anything, just sit and watch the flow of thoughts, just
watch.</p><p>This just watching dissolves thought by itself.</p><p><br></p><p>The awakening of witnessing brings freedom from the modifications of
the mind.</p><p>With thoughts finished, consciousness is. This is samadhi.</p><p>Love to all friends. 20</p><p>Love</p><p><br></p><p>Last night when lamps and lamps were lit up all over town</p><p>I thought: My Sohan too, must have lit lamps and a few among them
must surely be for me!</p><p>And then I began to see the lamps you had lit, and also those your
love has kept lit always.</p><p>I shall stay here another day.</p><p><br></p><p>I have talked of you to everybody and they are eager to meet you.</p><p>21</p><p><br></p><p>Beloved!</p><p><br></p><p>Your letter came, and your photo too. You look really simple and
innocent in it! Such love and devotion!</p><p>The heart when purified by love turns into a temple and I can see
this clearly in your photo.</p><p>May God help this simple innocence grow!</p><p><br></p><p>Two thousand years ago someone asked Christ: Who can enter the
kingdom of heaven</p><p>Jesus pointed to a little child and said:</p><p><br></p><p>Those whose hearts are as innocent as a child’s. Looking at your
picture today, I remembered this story.</p><p>22</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>I have only just arrived here, the train was five</p><p>hours late.</p><p><br></p><p>You wanted me to write as soon as I got here so I am doing so.</p><p>Throughout the journey I thought of you and of the tears falling from
your eyes.</p><p>Nothing in the world is more sacred than tears of love and joy.</p><p>Such tears, so pure, are not of this world. Though part of the body,
they express something which is not.</p><p>Whatever can I give you in return. 23</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked for your letter as soon as I got here yesterday.</p><p>Though it was Sunday, I kept waiting for it.</p><p><br></p><p>It came this evening – how much you write in so few words!</p><p>When the heart is full it pours into the words and so few are
needed.</p><p>An ocean of love can be contained in just a jug! As for scriptures on
love – it is enough to know the four letters of the word!</p><p>Do you know how many times I read through your</p><p>letters?</p><p><br></p><p>24</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Your letter arrived this morning. The garland you have weaved from
flowers of love</p><p>has a fragrance that I can catch! And the love-vine you have sown
spreads through my heart!</p><p>The tears of your love and joy bring light and strength to my eyes!
How blissful it all is!</p><p>25</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>I am in bliss.</p><p><br></p><p>It was good that you met me in Bombay,</p><p><br></p><p>my heart was overjoyed to see what is happening in you.</p><p>This is how a person prepares</p><p><br></p><p>and moves along the stairway towards truth. Life is a dual
journey:</p><p>one journey is in time and space the other is within oneself and
truth. The first ends in death</p><p>the second in deathlessness.</p><p><br></p><p>The second is the real journey because it takes you somewhere.</p><p>Those who take the first journey as it, waste their lives</p><p>the real life begins the day you start the other journey.</p><p>A really good beginning has taken place in your consciousness</p><p>and I am filled with bliss to feel this. 26</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>On my return home from the tour I looked for your letter.</p><p>It came together with the grapes</p><p><br></p><p>so the letter, already sweet, became still sweeter. I am in
bliss.</p><p>Your love enhances it yet more and the love of all makes it infinite.
One body – so much bliss!</p><p>What else can others do but envy he who feels all bodies to be
his!</p><p>May God make you envious of me, may everybody envy me,</p><p>this is my prayer. 27</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Your letter reached me</p><p><br></p><p>as I was sitting on that very same spot on the grass!</p><p>What I was thinking then</p><p><br></p><p>I shall tell you only when we meet.</p><p><br></p><p>What a fragrance memories leave behind!</p><p><br></p><p>When life is filled with love it is so blissful</p><p>Life’s only paupers</p><p><br></p><p>are those without love in their hearts, and how to describe the good
fortune</p><p>of those whose hearts hold nothing but love!</p><p><br></p><p>In moments of such abundance one encounters God.</p><p>Only love alone have I known as God. 28</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>I received your letter.</p><p><br></p><p>I am blissful to learn of your bliss This for me IS bliss</p><p>With every breath</p><p>I pray for all to be filled with bliss. This is my understanding of
religion.</p><p>The religion that ends in temples, mosques, churches,</p><p>is a dead religion.</p><p><br></p><p>A religion that fails to go beyond dead words and doctrines</p><p>has no significance</p><p><br></p><p>An authentic and living religion unites one with the whole</p><p>and leads one to the whole.</p><p><br></p><p>Religion is whatever unites you with the cosmos.</p><p><br></p><p>Whatever feelings</p><p><br></p><p>lead you towards this marvellous meeting and merging</p><p>are prayers,</p><p><br></p><p>and all those prayers can be expressed in a single word;</p><p>that word is love. What does love want?</p><p>Love wants to share with all the bliss it has.</p><p>Love wants to share itself with everyone!</p><p><br></p><p>To give of oneself unconditionally – that is love.</p><p>To love</p><p><br></p><p>is to dedicate one’s being to the whole as the drop surrenders to the
sea.</p><p>I pulsate with such love.</p><p><br></p><p>It has filled my life with nectar and light. Now I have only one
wish:</p><p>that what has happened to me should happen to all! Give my love to
everyone there.</p><p>29</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>I received your letter.</p><p><br></p><p>How did you hurt your finger?</p><p><br></p><p>It sounds as if you are not taking care of your body.</p><p>And why the restless mind?</p><p><br></p><p>In this dreamlike world there is nothing worth making the mind
restless for.</p><p>Peace is the greatest bliss and there is nothing worth losing it
for.</p><p>Meditate on it.</p><p><br></p><p>Just being aware of the truth brings about inner change.</p><p>I think you won’t be coming to Udaipur to assist me and that’s on
your mind.</p><p>Come if you can,</p><p><br></p><p>if you can’t – never mind,</p><p><br></p><p>you are helping me all the time. Isn’t one’s love help enough?</p><p>If you don’t come I will miss you</p><p><br></p><p>because the camp at Udaipur is linked for me with being with you, so
I am hoping you can come.</p><p>Regards to all.</p><p><br></p><p>30</p><p><br></p><p>Love,</p><p><br></p><p>and lots of it.</p><p><br></p><p>I looked at once for your letter</p><p><br></p><p>amongst the pile waiting for me on my return. I can’t tell you how
glad I was to get it – written by hand, too.</p><p>You write: Now your presence is felt in your absence.</p><p>love really IS presence. Where there is love space and time
vanish,</p><p>and where there is no love</p><p><br></p><p>Even what is near in space and time keeps immeasurably apart.</p><p>Only lovelessness separates</p><p>and love is the only nearness.</p><p><br></p><p>Those who find total love</p><p><br></p><p>discover everything within themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole world then is inside, not outside and the moon and stars
lie in the inner sky. In this fullness of love, ego vanishes.</p><p>I want God to lead you to this fullness. 31</p><p>I arrived here yesterday</p><p><br></p><p>and have been thinking of writing ever since but it didn’t happen
until now.</p><p>Forgive the delay though even a single day’s delay is no small
delay!</p><p>What shall I say about the return journey? It was very blissful.</p><p>I kept sleeping, and you were with me.</p><p><br></p><p>It appeared I had left you behind but actually you were still with
me.</p><p>This is the being-together that is so real that it cannot be
divided.</p><p>Physical nearness is not nearness, there can be no union on that
level, only an unbridgeable gulf, but there is another nearness which is
not of the body, and its name is love.</p><p>Once gained it is never lost.</p><p><br></p><p>Then no separation exists despite vast distances in the visible
world.</p><p>If you can arrive at this distancelessness with even one other it can
be found with everybody. One is the door, the all, the goal.</p><p>The beginning of love is through ONE, the end is ALL.</p><p>The love that unites you with everything, with nothing excluded, I
call religion, and the love that stops ANYWHERE I call sin.</p><p>32</p><p><br></p><p>I received your letter;</p><p><br></p><p>I have been waiting for it ever since I returned. But how sweet it is
to wait!</p><p>Life itself is a waiting! Seeds wait to sprout, rivers to reach the
ocean. What does man wait for?</p><p>He too is the seed for some tree, a river for some ocean.</p><p>Whoever looks deep inside</p><p><br></p><p>finds that a longing for the endless and boundless is his very
being,</p><p>and whoever recognizes this begins his journey towards God</p><p>because who can be thirsty and not look for water? This has never
happened and never will!</p><p>Where there is longing, there is thirst for attainment.</p><p>I want to make everyone aware of this thirst.</p><p><br></p><p>I want to convert everyone’s life into a waiting. The life that has
turned into a waiting for God is the true life.</p><p>All other ways of life are just a waste, a disaster.</p><p>33</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>I received your letter.</p><p><br></p><p>Its poetry filled my heart.</p><p><br></p><p>It is said that poetry is born out of love in your letter I saw this
happen.</p><p>Where there is love</p><p><br></p><p>the whole existence becomes a poem;</p><p><br></p><p>the flowers of life bloom under the light of love.</p><p><br></p><p>It is strange that you ask</p><p><br></p><p>why my heart holds so much love for you. Can love ever be caused?</p><p>If it is,</p><p><br></p><p>can it be called love?</p><p><br></p><p>Oh, my mad friend! love is always uncaused! This is its mystery,</p><p>and its purity.</p><p><br></p><p>Love is divine</p><p><br></p><p>and belongs to the kingdom of God because it is uncaused.</p><p>As for me</p><p><br></p><p>l am filled with love</p><p><br></p><p>as a lamp is filled with light.</p><p><br></p><p>To see this light one needs eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>You have those eyes so you saw the light. The credit is yours, not
mine.</p><p>34</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>I never imagined that you would write such a loving letter!</p><p>And you say that you are uneducated!</p><p><br></p><p>There is no knowledge greater than love, and those who lack love –
these are the true illiterates, because the heart is the real thing in
life not the intellect.</p><p>Bliss and light spring from the heart not from the</p><p>mind, and you have so much heart – that is enough! Can there be a
better witness of this than me?</p><p>I am surprised that you write asking me to point out any mistakes you
have made.</p><p>So far on earth, love has not made one mistake. All mistakes happen
through lack of love,</p><p>in fact this for me is the only mistake in life.</p><p><br></p><p>Writing you you: May God make you envious of me was no mistake.</p><p>I would like the bliss that has arisen in my heart to make you thirst
for it more and more.</p><p>Queen of Mewal! there is no reason for you to worry about it!</p><p>35</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>It was just this time of night, two days ago that I left you at
Chittor.</p><p>I can see now</p><p><br></p><p>the love and bliss filling your eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>The secret of all prayer and worship</p><p><br></p><p>is hidden in the overflow of those tears. They are sacred.</p><p>God fills the heart of those he blesses with tears of love,</p><p>and what to say about the calamity</p><p><br></p><p>of those whose hearts are filled instead with thorns of hate?</p><p>Tears flowing in love</p><p><br></p><p>are offerings of flowers at the feet of God</p><p><br></p><p>and the eyes from which they flow are blessed with divine vision.</p><p>Only eyes filled with love can see God.</p><p><br></p><p>Love is the only energy</p><p><br></p><p>that transcends the inertia of nature and takes one to the shores of
ultimate awareness.</p><p>I think that by the time this letter reaches you you will already
have left for Kashidham.</p><p>I don’t know how your journey was</p><p><br></p><p>but I hope it passed in song and laughter. Give my kind respects to
everyone there. I am waiting, for your promised letters.</p><p>36</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>I was very happy to meet you the other day.</p><p><br></p><p>I felt the stirrings of your heart and the longing of your soul.</p><p>You have not yet flowered as you were born to: the seed is ready to
sprout and the soil is right you will</p><p>not have long to wait.</p><p><br></p><p>But now you have to work with great determination. It is only a
matter of starting the journey,</p><p>God’s gravitational pull does the rest. 37</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>It is good that you are forgetting the past</p><p><br></p><p>it will open up an altogether new dimension of life.</p><p>To live completely in the present is freedom.</p><p><br></p><p>The past does not exist apart from memory and nor does the future
apart from castles in the air.</p><p>What is, is always present, and if you start living unreservedly in
the present</p><p>you live in God.</p><p><br></p><p>once you are free of past and future the mind turns empty and
peaceful,</p><p>its waves die down</p><p><br></p><p>and what is left is limitless, endless. This is the ocean of truth
–</p><p>and may your river reach it!</p><p><br></p><p>P.S. I shall probably go to Ahmedabad in January, can you come with
me?</p><p>It would be good if we travelled together for a few</p><p>days. 38</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>I am glad to see such thirst for God! To have this thirst is a divine
blessing; where there is thirst – there the way is.</p><p>In fact, intense longing becomes the way.</p><p><br></p><p>God is summoning us at every moment</p><p><br></p><p>but because the strings of our heart are slack we don’t echo His
call.</p><p>If our eyes are closed then even if the sun is at the door we will be
in darkness;</p><p>and the sun is always at the door – we only have to open our eyes and
let it in, that’s all!</p><p>May God give you light, that’s my wish. My love and I are always with
you.</p><p>Regards to the family and love to the children. 39</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>I have your letter.</p><p><br></p><p>The wheel of the world keeps spinning but why spin with it?</p><p>See what is behind body and mind; that has never moved,</p><p>is not moving, can never move,</p><p>and thou art that, tat twam asi.</p><p><br></p><p>Waves lie on the surface of this ocean but in its depths – what is
THERE?</p><p>When the waves are taken for the ocean it is a terrible mistake.</p><p>Look at the wheel of a bullock cart:</p><p><br></p><p>the wheel turns because the axle does not; so remember your own
axle,</p><p>standing, sitting, asleep or awake, keep it in mind.</p><p>By and by, one begins to encounter the changeless behind all change.
You have asked me about the poem.</p><p>I had a little piece read out by someone, then it came to me: I
should hear it from you yourself!</p><p>Now when you read it out to me I shall listen – and then I can read
both you and your poem. 40</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>I received your letter on my return.</p><p><br></p><p>I welcome this birth of determination in you.</p><p>Such strength of will alone takes us to truth.</p><p>Our deepest powers are aroused by it,</p><p><br></p><p>the unorganized energy becomes organized and then there is music.</p><p>What tremendous energy exists in this atom of self!</p><p><br></p><p>But it can’t be known without utter intensity of will.</p><p>You must have seen rocks that even the strongest chisel</p><p>cannot break,</p><p><br></p><p>and yet the sprouting shrub or plant</p><p><br></p><p>slips cracks and crevices through it so easily! When the tiniest seed
is filled with determination to push through and reach the sun,</p><p>even the hardest rock has to give way.</p><p><br></p><p>So a weak seed wins over the mighty rocks! The tender seed breaks
through the hardest of rocks!</p><p>Why?</p><p><br></p><p>Because no matter how strong and powerful the rock, it is dead,</p><p>and because it is dead it has no will. The seed is tender,</p><p>it is weak, but alive!</p><p>Remember, where there is will there is life and where there is no
will there is no life. The seed’s will becomes its power.</p><p>and with this power its tiny roots sprout,</p><p>enter the rock and spread out, until one day they break the rock.
Life always wins over death.</p><p>The living force within has never been defeated by the dead obstacles
without – and never will be.</p><p>41</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Your letter was received with joy When the heart thirsts so much for
truth,</p><p>for peace, for religion,</p><p>one day you come face to face with the sun which dispels all life’s
darkness.</p><p>Thirst!</p><p><br></p><p>Pray!</p><p><br></p><p>Strive!</p><p>Wait!</p><p><br></p><p>A journey of a thousand miles is covered step by small step,</p><p>so don’t lose heart.</p><p><br></p><p>Vast distances can be covered one step at a time and an ocean filled
drop by drop.</p><p>My regards to all.</p><p><br></p><p>I shall be coming soon now. The rest when we meet.</p><p>42</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Your Letter has arrived.</p><p><br></p><p>You ask me about sex.</p><p><br></p><p>That energy too belongs to God</p><p><br></p><p>and through meditation it too can be transformed. No energy is bad
but there can, of course, be wrong use of energy.</p><p>When sex energy flows upwards it turns into brahmacharya
(celibacy).</p><p>It is good that you are becoming detached from it but that isn’t
enough.</p><p>You have to go through it to transform it, rejection just leaves you
arid and dry!</p><p>It is true you are not alone in your sex life</p><p>but sex is not essentially of the body at all but a modification of
the mind.</p><p>If the mind is completely transformed it affects the other person
too,</p><p>and one who is related so intimately is quickly affected.</p><p>Until we meet, keep in mind that:</p><p><br></p><p>there should be no calculated ill-will towards sex – cultivated
detachment is useless:</p><p>stay aware whilst making love, be a witness in this situation;</p><p>if one can stay in a state of meditation and right-mindfulness</p><p>then the sex energy can be successfully transformed.</p><p>We shall talk more about this when we meet. Brahmacharya is a
complete science in itself and many doors to bliss open on that
path.</p><p>Still, the very first thing is</p><p><br></p><p>a friendly attitude towards all one’s energies. Enmity towards them
does not lead to spiritual revolution</p><p>but to self-destruction.</p><p><br></p><p>Give my regards to all there.</p><p>You are not coming to Poona – I shall miss you. 43</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>You have asked me about sense of humour. We can talk about it in
detail when we meet but first of all:</p><p>the sense of humour should be directed towards oneself –</p><p>it is a very great thing to laugh at oneself and he who can laugh at
himself</p><p>gradually becomes full of concern and compassion for others.</p><p>In the entire world</p><p><br></p><p>no event, no subject, invites laughter like oneself.</p><p>About the truth of dreams as well we shall have to talk in
detail.</p><p>Some dreams are definitely true.</p><p><br></p><p>As the mind quietens down</p><p><br></p><p>glimpses of truth begin to appear in dreams.</p><p><br></p><p>Dreams are of four kinds</p><p><br></p><p>– those concerned with past lives,</p><p><br></p><p>– those concerned with the future,</p><p><br></p><p>– those concerned with the present,</p><p>– and those concerned with repressed desires. Contemporary psychology
knows something about the fourth type only.</p><p>I am glad to know that your mind moves towards being at peace.</p><p>Mind is what we want it to be,</p><p><br></p><p>peace and restlessness are both our own creations.</p><p><br></p><p>Man binds himself with his own chains</p><p><br></p><p>and so he is always at liberty to become free of the mind.</p><p>44</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>What gift is greater than love?</p><p><br></p><p>And still you ask – What have I given? Oh, mad one!</p><p>When love is given</p><p><br></p><p>there is nothing left to give, not even the giver,</p><p>for to give love is to give oneself. You have given yourself,</p><p>now where are you?</p><p><br></p><p>Having lost yourself,</p><p><br></p><p>now you are bound to find</p><p><br></p><p>the one you have been longing to meet.</p><p>Now she has been born, and I am a witness to it,</p><p>I have watched it happen.</p><p><br></p><p>I can hear the music that you are going to be. The other day,</p><p>when your heart was close to me. I heard it.</p><p>Intellect knows of the present</p><p><br></p><p>but for the heart the future is also the present. 45</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>I received your letter.</p><p><br></p><p>The time of my birth will have to be looked up.</p><p><br></p><p>I think the day was the eleventh of December, but even this is not
certain.</p><p>But tell your astrologer friend not to worry; the future will simply
come, there’s no point in worrying about it.</p><p>Whatever happens – ultimately it is all the same.</p><p><br></p><p>Dust returns unto dust</p><p><br></p><p>and life disappears like a line drawn on water. My regards to
everyone.</p><p>46</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p>It is a long time since I received your letter, you must be tired of
waiting for a reply.</p><p>Still, patient waiting has its own joy. On the path to God,</p><p>timeless waiting is the true sadhana. Waiting and waiting and
waiting.</p><p>And then,</p><p><br></p><p>just as a bud blooms, everything happens by itself.</p><p>You are coming to Nargol, aren’t you? My regards to all.</p><p>47</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>I was glad to receive your letter. Truth is unknown,</p><p>and to know it one has to die to the known. Once the banks of the
known are left behind one enters the ocean of the unknown.</p><p>Be brave and take the jump!</p><p><br></p><p>Into emptiness, the great emptiness! Because that’s where God
lives.</p><p>Love to all,</p><p><br></p><p>or to the only one!</p><p><br></p><p>For only THE ONE is.</p><p>He alone is. He is in all.</p><p>He is in all and in the emptiness also. 48</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>I have your letter and your question. Wherever I is there is a
barrier;</p><p>In fact, the i-attitude is the one and only barrier,</p><p>so sleeping, waking, sitting, walking – always be aware of it;</p><p>see it, recognize it</p><p>and remember it</p><p><br></p><p>wherever and whenever it comes, for recognition spells its death.</p><p>It is not the truth but just a dream,</p><p>and as soon as one becomes aware of dreaming the dream vanishes.</p><p>Dreams cannot be renounced –</p><p><br></p><p>how can you give up that which is not? To be aware of it is
enough.</p><p>Ego is man’s dream, his sleep,</p><p>so those who try to renounce it fall into yet another illusion.</p><p>Their humility, their egolessness are simply more dreams –</p><p>like dreaming you are waking whilst still dreaming. Don’t fall into
this trap.</p><p>Just keep in mind one thing:</p><p><br></p><p>Wake up and see! Regards to everyone there. 49</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>I am so happy to have got your letter. Can even a ray of love ever
come without the fragrance of joy?</p><p>And what is joy but the fragrance of love Yet the world is full of
mad people seeking happiness their whole lives – but with their backs
turned towards love!</p><p>The doors to God only open</p><p><br></p><p>when love turns into the prayer of our total being. But perhaps HIS
doors are already open,</p><p>yet eyes dosed to love</p><p><br></p><p>will, even so, never be able to see them.</p><p><br></p><p>And what is this you write? Momentary contact?</p><p>No! No! How can love’s contact be so? Love turns even a moment into
eternity.</p><p>Where there is love</p><p><br></p><p>there is nothing momentary, where there is love</p><p>there is eternity.</p><p><br></p><p>Is a drop just a drop?</p><p><br></p><p>No! No! It is the ocean!</p><p><br></p><p>The drop seen through eyes of love becomes the ocean!</p><p>50</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>I have got your letter.</p><p><br></p><p>I know well how your soul thirsts; soon it can be quenched –</p><p>you are right at the brink of the lake; you only have to open your
eyes,</p><p>and I can see that the lids are about to lift. I shall be with you
then,</p><p>always with you, so don’t worry.</p><p>Be patient and wait;</p><p><br></p><p>the seed takes its own time to break and bloom. Give my regards to
all.</p><p>More when we meet.</p><p><br></p><p>51</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>I received your letter. I am always with you. Don’t be worried, don’t
be sad,</p><p>and leave your sadhana in the hands of God. Let His will be done.</p><p>Be like a dry leaf,</p><p><br></p><p>let the winds take you where they will –</p><p><br></p><p>isn’t this what is meant by shunya (emptiness)? Do not swim,</p><p>just float.</p><p><br></p><p>Isn’t this what is meant by shunya? My regards to all.</p><p>52</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Your letter has come.</p><p><br></p><p>Love has not to be asked for – it is never obtained by asking; love
comes through giving –</p><p>it is our own echo.</p><p><br></p><p>You feel my love pouring on you</p><p>because you have become a river of love flowing towards me,</p><p>and when your love flows like this towards all you will find the
whole world flowing in love towards you.</p><p>To respond with unconditional love towards all, towards that which
is,</p><p>is the God-experience. 53</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Can two persons ever meet?</p><p><br></p><p>It is just not possible on this earth, communication seems impossible
– but at times the impossible happens. The other day it did.</p><p>Being with you, I felt meeting IS possible, and also
communication,</p><p>and without words, too. Your tears answered me.</p><p>I am deeply grateful for those tears. Such response is very rare.</p><p>I have seen your madhu shala, seen it again and again.</p><p>If I could sing</p><p>I would sing the same song that is there. I call that sannyas the
real sannyas which accepts the world with joy.</p><p>Aren’t samsara and moksha really one? Duality exists in
ignorance,</p><p>in knowledge there is only one.</p><p><br></p><p>Oh, can that really be religion</p><p><br></p><p>which cannot sing and dance the songs of bliss auld love?</p><p>P.S. I hear you are due to come here.</p><p><br></p><p>Come, and come soon.</p><p><br></p><p>Who can trust time –</p><p><br></p><p>Look – it is morning and the sun rises; how long will it be before it
sets?</p><p>54</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>I am one with all things – in beauty,</p><p>in ugliness,</p><p><br></p><p>for whatsoever is – there I am.</p><p>Not only in virtue</p><p><br></p><p>but in sin too I am a partner, and not only heaven</p><p>but hell too is mine. Buddha, Jesus, Lao Tzu – it is easy to be their
heir,</p><p>but Genghis, Taimur and Hitler? They are also within me!</p><h2 id=no-not-half-i-am-the-whole-of-mankind-whatsoever-is-mans-is-mine>No,
not half – I am the whole of mankind! Whatsoever is man’s is mine</h2><p>flowers and thorns, darkness as well as light,</p><p>and if nectar is mine, whose is poison? Nectar and poison – both are
mine.</p><p>Whoever experiences this I call religious,</p><p>for only the anguish of such experience can revolutionize life on
earth.</p><p>55</p><p><br></p><p>I have received your letter.</p><p><br></p><p>I was very glad indeed to get it, more so since you have sent a blank
sheet.</p><p>But I have read in it all that you have not written but wanted to
write.</p><p>Besides, what can words say?</p><p><br></p><p>Even after writing, what you had meant to write remains unwritten. so
your silent letter is very</p><p>lovely.</p><p><br></p><p>As it is, whenever you come to see me you are mostly silent, but your
eyes tell all, and your silence too.</p><p>Some deep thirst has touched you, some unknown shore has called
you.</p><p>Whenever God calls He calls this way – but how long will you go on
standing on the shore?</p><p>Look! The sun is out and the winds can’t wait to fill the boat’s
sails!</p><p>56</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>I have received your letters – but they are not</p><p><br></p><p>just letters really, they are poems born out of love, out of love and
prayer, for where there is love there is prayer.</p><p>So it is possible to get glimpses of God through another whom one
loves – love providing the eyes that can see God.</p><p>Love is the door through which He appears.</p><p><br></p><p>So when one loves all he can be seen in all things. Part and whole in
fact are not in opposition: deep love for even one other finally spreads
to all because love dissolves the self; leaving the no-self.</p><p>Love is like the sun, the individual like frozen ice.</p><p>Love’s sun melts the icebergs leaving a limitless ocean.</p><p>So the search for love is really the search for</p><p><br></p><p>God, because love melts, and also destroys; because love only melts
and only destroys.</p><p>It is both birth and death.</p><p><br></p><p>In it the self dies and THE ALL is born.</p><p><br></p><p>So there is certainly pain – in the birth as well as in the
death.</p><p>Love is a deep anguish of birth as well as death. But the poetry
flowering in you shows that you have begun to experience the joy that
lies in love’s anguish.</p><p>57</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Your letter has filled my heart with joy.</p><p><br></p><p>You are at the threshold of a great revolution;</p><p><br></p><p>now, even if you want to run away I will not let you.</p><p><br></p><p>You will certainly have to perish in it. so that you can be
reborn.</p><p>Gold has to pass through fire – only then is it purified.</p><p>Love is fire for you and I pray to God that your ego burns in it.</p><p>Then if love comes, prayer can come too; without love. prayer is not
possible.</p><p>Remember that body and soul are not two. The part of the person that
can be seen is the body, the part that cannot be seen is the soul.</p><p>The same holds true for God and matter: God made visible is matter
and what cannot be seen is God.</p><p>Take life easily and naturally, just as it comes. Welcome it in its
endless forms with an attitude of complete acceptance.</p><p>And do not impose yourself on life; life has its own discipline, its
own wisdom,</p><p>and those who are ready to live totally</p><p><br></p><p>have no need for any other discipline or wisdom. But you have always
been afraid of life and therefore you are afraid of love.</p><p>Now life has begun penetrating you, breaking your walls of
security.</p><p>So, God’s infinite grace showers on you! Don’t run from it now,
accept it gratefully and my good wishes are always with you. 58</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Be aware in the waking state, don’t try to become aware in sleep or
dreams.</p><p>If you become aware in the waking state awareness</p><p><br></p><p>in dreams and sleep comes easily – but you don’t have to do anything
for it, doing only creates difficulties.</p><p>Sleep reflects the waking state: what we are when awake we are in
sleep.</p><p>If we are asleep in the waking state only then is</p><p><br></p><p>sleep really SLEEP; the stream of thoughts during the waking state
becomes the web of dreams in sleep.</p><p>Being aware in the waking state will begin to reflect itself in sleep
too, and if there are no thoughts in the waking state dreams disappear
altogether in sleep.</p><p>Everything else is fine.</p><p><br></p><p>My regards to everyone there. 59</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>I was overjoyed to receive your letter – as pure and innocent as your
heart.</p><p>You want to write that which cannot be written so you send an
unwritten letter.</p><p>This is good, for it is better to remain silent</p><p>about that which cannot be expressed, but beware! silence also
speaks, it speaks and speaks so much! Silence can speak even where words
fail.</p><p>The void envelops even that which lines cannot contain, in fact what
can resist the embrace of the great void?</p><p>Nothing is left unsaid by silence.</p><p><br></p><p>Where words fail, silence is full of meaning. Where form ends, the
formless begins.</p><p>Where knowledge (VEDA) ends, transcendental knowledge (VEDANTA)
begins. When knowledge dies, the beyond begins.</p><p>Freedom from the word is truth. 60</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>How can I describe how happy I am to have received your letter?</p><p>Whenever I saw you, only one question arose in my mind –</p><p>How long are you going to keep away from me?</p><p><br></p><p>I knew you had to come closer to me, it was only a matter of time, so
I kept waiting and praying for you. To me, prayerful waiting is
love.</p><p>I also knew you were going through the pangs of a</p><p>new birth and that rebirth is very near – for only this can give soul
to your songs.</p><p>Words are the form and form has its own beauty, its own melody, its
own music, but this is not enough, and he who considers this enough
remains discontented for ever.</p><p>The soul of poetry lies in silence.</p><p><br></p><p>To me, prayerful waiting is love, and the void is the door to the
divine temple.</p><p>You have come to me and I want to take you to the Lord for how can
you come close to me without first coming closer to Him?</p><p>In fact without coming close to Him you cannot come close even to
yourself.</p><p>Then as so on as you come near Him you attain that life for which you
have gone through so many lives. To come close to oneself is to be
reborn – the principle of being twice born is just this.</p><p>And remember, not even the pebbles lying on the road are just
pebbles; they too await a new birth, for that second birth turns them
into diamonds.</p><p>P.S. To run after desires is to run after a mirage.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a journey from one death to another.</p><p><br></p><p>In the illusion that is life man dies this way time</p><p>and time again.</p><p><br></p><p>But those willing to die to their desires discover that death itself
dies for them.</p><p>61</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Where is truth?</p><p><br></p><p>Do not search for it for when has truth ever been found through
seeking? for in seeking, the seeker is present.</p><p>So don’t seek but lose yourself. He who loses himself finds truth. I
don’t say: seek and you will find. I say: he who loses himself, finds.
62</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>I was happy to receive your letter.</p><p><br></p><p>The drop doesn’t have to become the ocean. it already is the
ocean.</p><p>it just has to know it.</p><p><br></p><p>What IS,</p><p><br></p><p>however it is,</p><p><br></p><p>to know it as it is, is truth.</p><p>And truth liberates.</p><p>63</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Life is an infinite mystery, therefore those who are filled with
knowledge are deprived of life.</p><p>Life becomes known only to the innocent, to those whose intuition is
not covered with the dust of knowledge.</p><p>64</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Do not seek nirvana as something opposed to life, rather, turn life
itself into nirvana.</p><p>Those who know, do this.</p><p><br></p><p>Dogen has these beautiful words to say: Do not strive after moksha
(liberation); rather, allow all your actions to become liberating.</p><p>This happens.</p><p><br></p><p>I can tell you this from my own experience; and the day it
happens</p><p>life becomes as beautiful as a flower in full bloom and brims with
fragrance.</p><p>65</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>I received your letter on my return.</p><p>Just as the seed within the soil waits for the rains so you wait for
God.</p><p>Prayerful wholehearted surrender is the door leading to Him.</p><p>Let yourself go completely just like a boat</p><p><br></p><p>floating on the river; you do not have to row the boat, just let it
go loose; you are not to swim, just to</p><p>float, then the river itself takes you to the ocean. The ocean is
very near – but only for those who float but do not swim.</p><p>Do not be afraid of drowning because that fear</p><p><br></p><p>makes you swim – and the truth is that he who drowns himself in God
is saved for ever; and do not have a goal, for he who has a goal begins
to swim.</p><p>Remember always – wherever one reaches, that is a the destination,
therefore he who makes God his goal goes astray.</p><p>Wherever the mind is free from all goals – there alone is God.</p><p>66</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>I say: Die, so that you can live!</p><p><br></p><p>When the seed destroys itself, it becomes the tree; when the drop
loses itself, it becomes the ocean.</p><p>But man – man refuses to lose himself. How then can God manifest in
him?</p><p>Man IS the seed, God is the tree. Man is the drop, God is the ocean.
67</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Leave the old track –</p><p><br></p><p>only the dead walk on trodden paths; life is the continuous quest for
the new.</p><p>Only he who has the flair to be new every moment truly lives.</p><p>Die to the old every moment so that you are for ever new –</p><p>this is the crux of the transformation of life. 68</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Truth is like the sky: eternal, everlasting, boundless.</p><p>Is there a door to enter the sky?</p><p><br></p><p>Then how can there be one to enter into truth? If our eyes are
closed, the sky exists not.</p><p>The same holds good for truth.</p><p><br></p><p>Opening the eyes is the door to truth; closing the eyes is to close
that door to truth.</p><p>69</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Where to find truth?</p><p><br></p><p>Well, it has to be sought within one’s own self, within one’s own
self</p><p>within one’s own self within one’s own self It is definitely
there.</p><p>One who seeks it elsewhere loses it. 70</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>I am extremely grateful for your loving letter.</p><p><br></p><p>I take life as a whole and I am incapable of viewing it in bits and
pieces; it is already the whole</p><p>but because it has been viewed in fragments for so long it has become
perverted.</p><p>There is no politics, no morality, no religion;</p><p><br></p><p>there is LIFE, there is God, whole and unfragmented.</p><p><br></p><p>It has to be sought, recognized and lived in all</p><p><br></p><p>its forms, therefore I shall continue to speak on all its forms.</p><p>And this is only the beginning.</p><p><br></p><p>Answering journalists is just preparing the ground. All paths lead to
one end – certain friends might</p><p>take some time to understand this truth.</p><p><br></p><p>As things are, this delay in understanding the truth is unavoidable,
but seekers of truth won’t be afraid – courage is the first condition in
the search for truth.</p><p>Remember, as long as spirituality does not become a philosophy of the
whole life it proves impotent, and only escapists will take shelter
behind it.</p><p>Spirituality has to be turned into a force, spirituality has to be
turned into a revolution, only then can spirituality be saved.</p><p>My regards to all.</p><p><br></p><p>71</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Man becomes a slave because he is afraid to be alone, so he needs a
crowd, a society, an organization.</p><p>Fear is the basis of all institutions, and how can a frightened mind
know the truth?</p><p>Truth requires fearlessness and fearlessness comes from sadhana, not
from societies, that is why all religions, institutions and
organization, bar the path of truth.</p><p>72</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p>Don’t be in a hurry.</p><p><br></p><p>So often, hurrying causes delay.</p><p><br></p><p>As you thirst, wait patiently – the deeper the waiting the sooner it
comes.</p><p>You have sown the seed, now sit in the shade and watch what
happens.</p><p>The seed will break, it will blossom, but you cannot speed the
process.</p><p>Doesn’t everything need time?</p><p><br></p><p>Work you must, but leave the results to God. Nothing in life is ever
wasted, especially steps taken towards truth.</p><p>But at times impatience comes, impatience comes with thirst, but this
is an obstacle.</p><p>Keep the thirst and throw the impatience. Do not confuse impatience
with thirst.</p><p>With thirst there is yearning but no struggle with impatience there
is struggle but no yearning.</p><p>With longing there is waiting but no demanding with impatience there
is demanding but no waiting.</p><p>With thirst there are silent tears with impatience there is restless
struggle.</p><p>Truth cannot be raided, it is attained through</p><p>surrender not through struggle.</p><p><br></p><p>It is conquered through total surrender. 73</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Your letter has been received. Why seek at all for a purpose?</p><p>If you seek this you will never find it because it is eternally
hidden in the seeker.</p><p>Life is without purpose – life is its own purpose, therefore he who
lives without purpose truly lives. Live! Isn’t living itself enough?</p><p>The desire to have more than just life is a result of not properly
living – and that is why the fear of</p><p>death grips the human mind, for what is death to one who is really
alive!</p><p>Where living is intense and total there is no time to fear death –
and there is no time for death, either.</p><p>Do not think in the language of purpose – that language is diseased
in itself.</p><p>The sky exists without purpose.</p><p><br></p><p>God is without purpose flowers bloom without purpose</p><p>and stars shine without purpose –</p><p>what has happened to poor man that he cannot live without
purpose!</p><p>Because man can think he gets into trouble. A little thinking always
leads to trouble.</p><p>If you must think, think completely, utterly! Then the mind whirls so
fast with thoughts that freedom from thoughts is attained.</p><p>Then you begin to live. 74</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Rest is the supreme goal, work is the medium. Total relaxation, with
complete freedom from effort, is the supreme goal.</p><p>Then life is a play, and then even effort becomes play.</p><p>Poetry, philosophy, religion are the fruits of repose.</p><p>This has not been available to everyone</p><p><br></p><p>but technology and science will make it so in the near future.</p><p>That is why I am in favour of technology. Those who attribute
intrinsic value to labour oppose the use of machines – they have to.</p><p>For me, labour has no such intrinsic value: on the</p><p>contrary, I see it as a burden.</p><p><br></p><p>As long as work is a prerequisite for rest it cannot be blissful.</p><p>When work flows out of a state of rest voluntarily then it is
blissful.</p><p>So I cannot call rest a sin. Nor do I support sacrifice.</p><p>I do not want anyone to live for anybody else, or one generation to
sacrifice itself for another.</p><p>Such sacrifices turn out to be very costly – those who make them
expect an inhuman return.</p><p>This is why fathers expect the impossible from their sons.</p><p>If each father lives for his son who will live for himself?</p><p>For every son is a potential father.</p><p><br></p><p>No, I want everyone to live for himself – for his own happiness, his
own state of rest.</p><p>When a father is happy he does much more for his son – and easily,
because it comes out of his happiness.</p><p>Then there is neither sacrifice nor renunciation; what he does comes
naturally out of his being a father –</p><p>and a happy father at that.</p><p><br></p><p>Then he has no inhuman expectations of his son and where there is no
pressure from expectations, expectations are fulfilled – out of the son
being a son.</p><p>In short, I teach each person to be selfish.</p><p><br></p><p>Altruistic teachings have taught man nothing but suicide. and a
suicidal man is always homicidal; the unhappy sow their sorrow amongst
others.</p><p>I am also against the sacrifice of the present for</p><p><br></p><p>the future, because what is is always present; if you live in it
totally the future will be born out of it –</p><p>and when it comes it too will be the present.</p><p><br></p><p>For he who has the habit of sacrificing the present</p><p><br></p><p>for the future the future never comes because whatever comes is again
always sacrificed for that which has not yet come.</p><p>Finally, you ask why i too work for others and for the future.</p><p>First of all, I do not work.</p><p><br></p><p>Whatever I do flows out of my state of rest. I do not swim, I just
float.</p><p>No one can ever do anything for another</p><p><br></p><p>but if something happens to others out of what I</p><p>am,</p><p><br></p><p>that is something else,</p><p><br></p><p>and there too I am not the doer. As for the future –</p><p>for me, the present is everything.</p><p><br></p><p>And the past too is also a present – that has passed away;</p><p>and the future too – that is a present that is yet to come.</p><p>Life is always here and now</p><p><br></p><p>so I do not bother about past and future.</p><p><br></p><p>And it is amazing that ever since I stopped</p><p><br></p><p>worrying about them they have begun to worry about me! My regards to
all there.</p><p>75</p><p><br></p><p>There is a music which has no sound; the soul is restless for such
silent music. There is a love in which the body is not; the soul longs
for such unembodied love. There is a truth which has no form;</p><p>the soul longs for this formless truth. Therefore melodies do not
satisfy, bodies do not satisfy</p><p>and forms cannot fulfil the soul.</p><p>But this lack of fulfillment,</p><p><br></p><p>this dissatisfaction has to be understood properly, for such
understanding ultimately brings about transcendence.</p><p>Then sound becomes the door to the soundless, the body becomes the
path to the unembodied, and form becomes the formless.</p><p>76</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>God is our only wealth.</p><p><br></p><p>Do not depend on any other wealth,</p><p><br></p><p>riches of any other kind bring only disaster.</p><p><br></p><p>St. Theresa wanted to set up a large orphanage but at the time she
had only three shillings.</p><p>She wanted to start this enormous project with just this small
amount.</p><p>Friends and admirers advised her: Get the funds together first.</p><p>What can you do with just three shillings?</p><p><br></p><p>Theresa laughed and said: Naturally Theresa can do nothing with three
shillings, but with three shillings PLUS GOD – nothing is
impossible!</p><p>77</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p>Samsara is nirvana. sound is mantra,</p><p>and all living beings are God. It depends on how you look.</p><p>The world is nothing but how one sees it. See! Open your eyes and

Where is death?</p><p>– there is only deathlessness. 78</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>I have received your letter.</p><p><br></p><p>As the earth thirsts for the rains after a hot summer</p><p>so you are thirsting for God.</p><p><br></p><p>This thirst becomes an invitation to the divine clouds –</p><p>and the invitation has arrived.</p><p><br></p><p>Just keep drowning yourself in meditation and His grace will
definitely pour on you. If you are ready here –</p><p>He is always ready there.</p><p><br></p><p>Look! Can’t you see His clouds hovering in the sky?</p><p>79</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Do not fight with yourself; you are as you are,</p><p>do not strive to change. Do not swim in life,</p><p>just float,</p><p><br></p><p>like a leaf on the stream.</p><p><br></p><p>Keep away from sadhanas, mere sadhanas, this is the only sadhana.</p><p>Where is there to go? What is there to become? What is there to
find?</p><p>What is, is here and now – Please, stop and see!</p><p>What are the animal instincts? What is low? and high?</p><p>Whatever is, is –</p><p><br></p><p>there is no high, no low. What is animal?</p><p>What is divine?</p><p><br></p><p>So do not condemn, do not praise,</p><p>nor condemn nor praise yourself:</p><p>all differences are of the mind. In truth no differences exist;</p><p>there, God and animal are one and the same; heaven and hell are just
two sides of one coin; SAMSARA and nirvana are two expressions of one
unknown.</p><p>And do not think about what I have said; if you think you will
miss.</p><p>See. Just see. 80</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>On the road to God the only sustenance is infinite hope – hope
shining like the north star in darkness,</p><p>hope keeping you company like a shadow in loneliness.</p><p><br></p><p>Dark and lonely life’s path certainly is – but only for those without
hope.</p><p>The famous geographical explorer Donald Macmillan was preparing for
his journey to the north pole when he received a letter.</p><p>On it was written:</p><p><br></p><p>To be opened only when there is no hope of survival. Fifty years
passed; the envelope remained with Macmillan as it was – sealed.</p><p>Someone asked him the reason for this and he</p><p>replied:</p><p><br></p><p>For one thing I want to keep faith with the unknown sender, and for
another, I have never given up hope. What priceless words! – Ihave never
given up hope 81</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>I am delighted you have taken sannyas.</p><p><br></p><p>A life without the flower of sannyas is like a barren tree.</p><p>Sannyas is the supreme music of life.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not renunciation, on the contrary, it is life’s highest
enjoyment.</p><p>Someone who finds diamonds and pearls is not going to bother about
pebbles and stones.</p><p>But note – he does not renounce them, interest simply drops away.</p><p>82</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Thought is man’s strength</p><p><br></p><p>but blind belief has robbed him of it,</p><p><br></p><p>that is why he has become weak and impotent. Think fully,</p><p>think tirelessly,</p><p><br></p><p>for amazingly enough the state of no-thought</p><p>is achieved only at the peak of thought, it is the culmination of
thought,</p><p>and at this point all thought becomes useless. In this emptiness,
truth lies.</p><p>83</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>All crutches bar the way.</p><p><br></p><p>Shun all support and then you will receive His. He is the only help
for the helpless.</p><p>There is no other guide but Him – all other guides are obstacles on
the path.</p><p>If you want to reach the Master avoid all teachers.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t be afraid to make yourself empty for that alone is the
door,</p><p>that alone is the path –</p><p><br></p><p>and that alone is the destination.</p><p><br></p><p>The courage to be empty</p><p><br></p><p>is all that is needed to become one with the all. Those who are full
stay empty,</p><p>and those who are empty become filled – such are His mathematics.</p><p>Do not consider doing anything – through doing you can never reach
Him, nor through chanting,</p><p>nor through austerity, for He is already here! Stop and see!</p><p>To do is to run, not to do is to halt.</p><p>Yes! If He were far away we could run to meet Him, but He is the
nearest of the near!</p><p>If we had lost Him we could search for and find Him,</p><p>hut to us He has never been lost! 84</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>I am glad to have received your letter.</p><p><br></p><p>The I is not to be given up because – how can you drop that which is
not?</p><p>The I has to be looked into, understood.</p><p><br></p><p>It is like taking a lamp to search for darkness – the darkness
vanishes!</p><p>Darkness cannot be stamped out because it doesn’t exist.</p><p>You just have to bring a light and darkness is unmasked.</p><p>It is the same with your thoughts – do not fight with them; the
effort to be free of thought comes</p><p>itself from a thought.</p><p><br></p><p>Know your thoughts, watch them, be aware of them, then they quieten
down without difficulty.</p><p>Witnessing finally leads to emptiness and where there is emptiness –
there is the ALL.</p><p>85</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Why does man suffer so much?</p><p><br></p><p>Because in his life there is pandemonium but no soundless music,</p><p>Because in his life there is a babble of thoughts but no
emptiness,</p><p>because in his life there is a turmoil of feeling but no
equanimity,</p><p>because in his life there is a mad rushing around but no stillness
which knows no directions,</p><p>and finally because in his life there is much of himself</p><p>but of God, nothing at all. 86</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>The time is ripe.</p><p><br></p><p>The hour draws nearer every day. Innumerable souls are restless.</p><p>A path has to be created for them. So hurry!</p><p>Work hard!</p><p><br></p><p>Surrender totally!</p><p><br></p><p>Forget yourself!</p><p><br></p><p>Plunge into God’s work like a madman; here, only madness will do
–</p><p>and there is no greater wisdom than such madness for God.</p><p>87</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Non-attachment is not concerned with things but with thoughts.</p><p>Non-attachment is not related to the outside but to the within.</p><p>Non-attachment is not to do with the world but with oneself.</p><p>One day a beggar went to see a Sufi fakir and found him seated on a
velvet cushion inside a beautiful tent with its ropes tied to golden
pegs.</p><p>Seeing all this the beggar cried: What is this! Honourable Fakir, I
have heard much about your spirituality and non-attachment, but I am
completely disillusioned by all this ostentation around you.</p><p>The fakir laughed, replying :I am ready to leave all this behind and
come with you.</p><p>So saying, he immediately got up and walked off</p><p><br></p><p>with the beggar not even waiting to put his sandals on! After a short
while the beggar became distressed.</p><p>I left my begging bowl in your tent, he said. What shall I do without
it!</p><p>Please wait here while I go and fetch it. The Sufi laughed. My
friend, he said,</p><p>the gold pegs of my tent were stuck in the earth not in my heart,</p><p>but your begging bowl is still chasing after you! To be in the world
is not attachment.</p><p>The presence of the world in the mind is the attachment, and when the
world disappears from the mind – this is non-attachment.</p><p>88</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Once the ego is surrendered there is no suffering, no sorrow, for the
ego is basically the cause of all suffering and the moment it is seen
that everything is God there is no more cause for complaint.</p><p>Where complaining has ended, there is prayer. It is a feeling of
gratitude, it is trust in God.</p><p>In this trust in God, benediction pours. Trust and know.</p><p>It is very difficult to trust but there is no austerity greater than
accepting life as it is. 89</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Do not look for results in meditation – this is an obstruction.</p><p>Do not seek to repeat any meditative experience, for this too is a
hindrance.</p><p>When meditating, just meditate, the rest then happens by itself.</p><p>The way to God does not lie in our hands so leave yourself in
His.</p><p>Surrender, surrender, surrender! Remember always – surrender!
Sleeping or waking – remember! Surrender is the only door to God.</p><p>Emptiness is the only boat that sails to Him. 90</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>How much longer will you go on letting your energy sleep?</p><p>How much longer are you going to stay oblivious</p><p>of the immensity of your self. Don’t waste time in conflict, lose no
time in doubt –</p><p>time can never be recovered and if you miss an opportunity,</p><p>it may take many lives before another comes your way again.</p><p>91</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>I received your letter.</p><p><br></p><p>Do not fall into the whirl of calming the mind; this in itself is the
restlessness.</p><p>The mind is what it is, accept it as such. This acceptance brings
peace.</p><p>Rejection is restlessness, acceptance is peace – and he who reaches
total acceptance attains to God. There is no other way than this.</p><p>Understand this well because this understanding brings
acceptance.</p><p>Acceptance cannot come from an act of will – the action of will is
itself non-accepting;</p><p>I DO conceals non-acceptance because will is always of the ego.</p><p>Ego cannot live unless fed by rejection.</p><p>Acceptance can never be brought about by action, only understanding
life can bring it about.</p><p>Look, look at life. What is IS, it is as it is.</p><p>Things are such – do not ask for them to be</p><p><br></p><p>otherwise because they cannot be even if you so desire. Desire is
altogether impotent.</p><p>Ah, how can there he restlessness without desire? 92</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Search, search and search –</p><p><br></p><p>so much that finally the seeker vanishes. There you meet Him.</p><p>Where the I is lost, there He is. There is not, and never has been,
any wall between –</p><p>except for the I.</p><p><br></p><p>93</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>When the moon lifts into the sky watch it, be absorbed by it – forget
everything else, including yourself!</p><p>Only then will you come to know the music that has no sound</p><p>When the morning sun rises bow town to the earth ant lose yourself in
homage to it.</p><p>Only then will you know of the music that is not made by man.</p><p>When the trees burst into flowers, like a flower, dance with them in
the breeze.</p><p>Only then will you hear the music that lives in one’s innermost
self.</p><p>He who knows this music knows life too – its song is another word for
God.</p><p>94</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t float with the current of thoughts, just be aware of them.</p><p>Know that you are separate from them, distinct, distant, just an
observer.</p><p>Just watch the flow of thoughts like traffic, watch</p><p><br></p><p>than as you watch the dry leaves flying everywhere in the fall.</p><p>Don’t be the one who makes them happy, don’t be the one to whom they
happen.</p><p>Then the rest takes place by itself. This rest is what I call
meditation. 95</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>This is a good beginning to the struggle and I am glad to have pushed
you into it</p><p>Sannyas is a challenge to the world, a fundamental declaration of
freedom.</p><p>To live in freedom every moment is sannyas. Now, insecurity will be
with you always, but that is a fact of life.</p><p>The only certainty is death and life IS insecurity, and that is its
joy and its beauty.</p><p>To be locked in security is suicide, a living death effected by one’s
own hand.</p><p>Such living-dead are everywhere, they have turned the world into a
graveyard, and they number amongst them many celebrated corpses.</p><p>They all have to be awakened. though for their part they are trying
to put back to sleep even those who are awake.</p><p>Now the struggle will go on and on In it your total resolution will
be born.</p><p>Far off I see your destination the other shore. 96</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>I was travelling, then on my return, there was your</p><p>letter.</p><p><br></p><p>You can meet friends of Jeevan Jagruti Kendra and begin working for
Yuvak Kranti Dal (Revolutionary Youth Force).</p><p>There are no rules about it – there can never be rules in
revolution.</p><p>There needs to be an awakening of understanding among youth with
scientific studies replacing blind faith – this is all I wish for.</p><p>Do meet me this time when I come to Indore Everything is fine.</p><p>My regards to everyone there. 97</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>My work is only God’s work;</p><p><br></p><p>apart from this there is neither me nor mine. No other work exists
apart from His.</p><p>You just live in God, that’s all, and the rest happens by itself.</p><p>Jesus sail: First seek ye the Kingdom of God, then all else will be
added unto you.</p><p>I say the same.</p><p><br></p><p>But the mind of man seeks all else first, so what is bound to happen,
happens –</p><p>nothing else is gained.</p><p><br></p><p>and he even loses whatever he had. 98</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>The fragrance of SANNYAS has to be spread around the world.</p><p>Religions like goals</p><p><br></p><p>have imprisoned the flower of sannyas too within their great
walls.</p><p>Hence the SANNYASIN has to say now:</p><p><br></p><p>I belong to no religion – all religions are mine.</p><p><br></p><p>It was an awful mistake to tear sannyas away from the world.</p><p>It has become bloodless.</p><p><br></p><p>And the world without sannyas has lost its life. A new bridge has to
be built between the two.</p><p>Sannyas has to be given back its blood and the world, its soul.</p><p>Sannyas has to be returned to samsara, fearless and unattached,</p><p>in the world yet not of it, in the crowds, yet alone!</p><p>And the world has to be fetched to sannyas too, fearless and
unattached.</p><p>Then sannyas will be a real sannyas and not an escape from the
world.</p><p>It will be sannyas and in the world,</p><p><br></p><p>only then can that bridge of gold be built joining the seen with the
unseen,</p><p>the form with the formless. Commit yourself to this great work,</p><p>join in the building of this great bridge! 99</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the impossible is not impossible if resolution</p><p><br></p><p>is there, and even the possible becomes impossible if one lacks
will.</p><p>The world we live in is our own creation.</p><p><br></p><p>The time gap between sowing and reaping creates confusion.</p><p>Because cause and effect are so separated the mind fails to
understand what would otherwise be obvious. Nothing is fragmented or
disconnected.</p><p>The missing links are always there if you look deeply.</p><p>Understanding the life process opens the door to peace.</p><p>The light lies close by, waiting for the seeker.</p><p>100</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>I am glad to receive your letter.</p><p><br></p><p>You have the strength within but you don’t know about it.</p><p>To find it you need a catalyst.</p><p><br></p><p>The day you realize all this you will laugh,</p><p><br></p><p>but until then I am prepared to be your catalyst.</p><p><br></p><p>I am already laughing</p><p><br></p><p>and just waiting for the day you can join in this cosmic
laughter.</p><p>See! Krishna is laughing! Buddha is laughing! Listen! The earth and
heaven are laughing!</p><p>But man is weeping for he doesn’t know what he is. What a joke! What
a lark!</p><p>Emperors go on begging and fish are thirsty in the ocean!</p><p>101</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Existence is a play of sun and shade of hope and despair</p><p>of happiness and sorrow of life and death.</p><p>So existence is duality</p><p>a tension of opposite poles a music of contrary notes.</p><p>To know it</p><p><br></p><p>to recognize it</p><p><br></p><p>to experience it as such is to go beyond it.</p><p>This transcendence is the real sadhana, the real achievement.</p><p>The key to this transcendence is the witness state.</p><p>Bid goodbye to the doer, live in the witness state. Watch the
drama,</p><p>don’t drown in it,</p><p><br></p><p>rather be drowned in observing – then happiness and sorrow</p><p>birth and death remain just a play, they do not affect you they
cannot affect you.</p><p>All error, all ignorance, comes from identification.</p><p>102</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p>I received your letter.</p><p><br></p><p>It is good to know that your mother’s death has made you consider
your own.</p><p>One has to go through the very awareness of death to reach
deathlessness.</p><p>The thrust of death goes deep</p><p><br></p><p>but cunningly the mind goes on evading it. Don’t evade it,</p><p>don’t console yourself –</p><p><br></p><p>any kind of consolation is a suicide.</p><p><br></p><p>Let yourself completely feel the wound of death: wake up and live
with it!</p><p>This will be hard</p><p><br></p><p>but revolution always is. Death is,</p><p>it is there always,</p><p><br></p><p>but we forget about it. Every day death is there, every moment.</p><p>103</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>I received your letter. So many questions!</p><p>To answer them I would have to write a book</p><p>bigger than the MAHABHARATA!</p><p><br></p><p>But even then you would not get your answers because some questions
others can never answer – your answers lie deep within your own
life.</p><p>And some questions have no answers because they are wrong
questions</p><p>for which no answers can be found.</p><p><br></p><p>As the search continues</p><p><br></p><p>these questions always gradually drop away. Then there are some
questions which are right questions</p><p>but have no answers at all.</p><p><br></p><p>They have to be experienced deep within oneself. 104</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Do not desire bliss</p><p><br></p><p>because that desire gets in the way.</p><p><br></p><p>Live life unchained to desire and without an eye on a goal. Live
free!</p><p>Live from moment to moment! And don’t be afraid, be free of fear
because there is nothing to lose – and nothing to gain</p><p>– and the moment you realize this the totality of life is
attained.</p><p>But never approach the gates of life as a beggar, never go
begging,</p><p>for those gates never open to beggars! 105</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>It brings me happiness to bear witness to your new birth.</p><p>You have worked for it over many lives and now the boat flows
rightly,</p><p>I can rest assured about you. Once I made you a promise and this is
now fulfilled.</p><p>It is your turn to fulfil your part of the promise; make sure you
don’t miss the chance,</p><p>time is short</p><p><br></p><p>and I may not be able to be with you again. Muster your whole
will,</p><p>take the oars in your hands</p><p><br></p><p>and begin the journey that is infinite.</p><p><br></p><p>You have wasted much time sitting on the banks; now the winds are
favourable –</p><p>this I know,</p><p>and that’s why I am pushing you off the banks so earnestly.</p><p>God’s grace is showering, be open to it and let it in. Dance it and
drink it in!</p><p>With such nectar at hand will you still stay thirsty?</p><p>106</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>What is sought totally is always attained. Thoughts, when
concentrated,</p><p>become things.</p><p><br></p><p>As the river finds the ocean,</p><p><br></p><p>thirsty souls find the temple of God.</p><p><br></p><p>But the thirst must be intense and the work tireless</p><p>and the waiting without end</p><p><br></p><p>and the calling with the whole heart, and all this thirst, work,
waiting, calling – are contained in one small word</p><p>and that word is prayer.</p><p><br></p><p>But praying cannot be performed, it is not an act,</p><p>you can only be in it.</p><p>It is a feeling, it is the soul,</p><p>it is a surrender of oneself without words or demands. Leave yourself
to the unknown and accept whatever comes.</p><p>Whatever God makes of you – accept it, and if He breaks you accept
that too. just for dancing’s sake;</p><p>sing for singing’s sake;</p><p><br></p><p>then the whole life becomes divine and only then becomes prayer.</p><p>To live so is to be free. 107</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>My blessings on your new birth – sannyas is a new birth,</p><p>in oneself, by oneself, of oneself. It is also a death,</p><p>not an ordinary death but the great death. It is the death of all
that you were up until yesterday,</p><p>and what you are now –</p><p><br></p><p>that too must keep dying every moment</p><p>so that the new can be born and born and born again.</p><p>Now you will not remain you even for a moment, you have to die and be
reborn every moment – this is the only sadhana.</p><p>Live like a river, not like a pond. The pond is a householder,</p><p>the river, a sannyasin.</p><p><br></p><p>108</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>The temple of God is open only to a dancing, singing, happy
heart.</p><p>A sad heart cannot enter there so avoid sadness;</p><p>fill your heart with colour as vivid as a peacock – and for no
reason.</p><p>He who has reason to be happy is not really happy. Dance and sing
–</p><p>not for others, not for a reason,</p><p>just for dancing’s sake; sing for singing’s sake;</p><p>then the whole life becomes divine</p><p>and only then becomes prayer. To live so is to be free.</p><p>109</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>I am glad to get your letter.</p><p><br></p><p>The moment of the inward revolution is near but first you have to go
through the birth pangs. Nothing hurts more than this giving birth to
oneself</p><p>but what comes after it is life’s greatest bliss. So, longing,
waiting, prayer –</p><p>take these for your sadhana. Everything else is fine.</p><p>My regards to all.</p><p><br></p><p>110</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>As the birds sing each morning at sunrise, the heart fills with song

games,</p><p>all creatures of thought.

decision like a shadow. Seeds have to be sown in the mind as well, there
too – as we sow we reap,</p><p>THE WAY has to be carved out of the mind too. The temple of God is
close</p><p>but the mind is like a dense forest</p><p><br></p><p>we have to hack our way through to reach it. The first steps have to
be taken from where you are,</p><p>even for a long journey</p><p><br></p><p>the first steps have to be taken just close by, and in every
journey,</p><p>not only that towards truth,</p><p><br></p><p>the beginning is not different from the end – they are two ends of
the same span,</p><p>two poles of the same entity.</p><p><br></p><p>Yet often you cannot guess from the first step where you will end
up;</p><p>those first steps may seem quite unrelated to the last!</p><p>Charles Catering recollects this interesting incident:</p><p>Once I bet a friend</p><p><br></p><p>that if I bought him a birdcage to hang in his sitting-room</p><p>he would have to buy a bird.</p><p><br></p><p>The friend laughed and said he could keep a cage without a bird –</p><p>there was nothing to it!</p><p>He accepted the bet</p><p><br></p><p>and I bought him a beautiful cage from Switzerland which he hung in
his sitting-room.</p><p>Naturally, the inevitable happened – life has its own logic.</p><p>Whosoever saw the cage immediately sympathized with him, asking:</p><p>When did your bird die?</p><p><br></p><p>He would answer: I never had a bird.</p><p><br></p><p>Then they would say: So why the empty cage?</p><p><br></p><p>Finally he got sick and tired of explaining and went and bought a
bird.</p><p>When I asked him about it he said:</p><p><br></p><p>It was easier to buy the bird and lose the bet than to explain things
to each and every one from morn till night.</p><p>And also,</p><p><br></p><p>seeing this empty cage hanging there day in and day out, my mind kept
repeating: The bird! The bird! The bird!</p><p>So, if you hang commitment like a cage in the mind it won’t be long
before the bird of sadhana comes! 114</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Man lives not in reality but in dreams.</p><p>Each mind creates a world of its own which exists nowhere.</p><p>During the day as well as the night the mind is swamped in
dreams.</p><p>When the dreams become too much, too intense, insanity comes.</p><p>To be clear and healthy is to be without dreams. Once, the president
of a country went to inspect the nation’s largest lunatic asylum.</p><p>The director took him to a room and told him:</p><p><br></p><p>In this room, the inmates suffer from car-phobia. The president,
curious, looked through the window. But there is nobody there, he
said.</p><p>They are all there, sir – under the beds repairing cars, the director
replied.</p><p>Everyone is lying under their dreams in the same way. If this
president had looked within, what would he have found?</p><p>Is not every capital a great madhouse?</p><p><br></p><p>But one cannot see one’s own madness – this is a sure trait of
madness.</p><p>When someone starts doubting himself, seeing his madness, know well
that the time has come for his unsanity to go.</p><p>Awareness of madness marks the end of madness. Awareness of ignorance
heralds its end.</p><p>Awareness of dreaming brings dreams to an end. What is left is
truth.</p><p>115</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>I am very glad to have received your letter. Anxieties in life exist
but there is no need to worry about them.</p><p>Worrying stems not from the anxieties but from our attitude towards
them.</p><p>To be anxious or not is always our open choice. It is not that a
non-anxious mind is free of anxieties – anxieties are there, they are an
unavoidable part of life – but it does not burden itself with them.</p><p>Such a person always sees beyond them;</p><p><br></p><p>dark nights surround him too but his eyes look to</p><p><br></p><p>the rising sun and therefore his soul is never drowned in darkness
–</p><p>and this alone is enough –</p><p><br></p><p>that the soul be not drowned in darkness. The body is bound to drown
in it – in fact it already has.</p><p>Those who are condemned to die live their lives in darkness; only the
deathless have their lives rooted in the light.</p><p>Blessings to the children and regards to all. 116</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no greater power than trusting oneself – its fragrance is
not of this world;</p><p>peace, bliss and truth flow from this fragrance.</p><p><br></p><p>He who trusts himself is in heaven and he who mistrusts himself holds
the keys of hell in his hands.</p><p>The Scottish philosopher David Hume was an atheist, but every Sunday
he made it a point</p><p>to attend the sermon of John Brown, a confirmed theist.</p><p>When people pointed out</p><p><br></p><p>that going to church was against his own principles he laughed – and
replied: I have no faith whatever in what John Brown says,</p><p>but John Brown has total faith in what John Brown says.</p><p>So once a week I make a point of hearing a man who has total faith in
himself!</p><p>Love is also fire, but a cool fire.</p><p>Yet we have to burn in it because it also purifies; it burns only to
purify.</p><p>The dross burns leaving pure gold.</p><p>In the same way my love will bring suffering</p><p><br></p><p>because I wish to destroy you in order to recreate you. The seed must
be broken –</p><p>how else can the tree be born? The river must end –</p><p>how else is it to merge with the ocean? So let go of yourself and die
–</p><p>how else will you find the SELF? 117</p><p>Note: Is missing...</p><p><br></p><p>118</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Truth is discovered not through swimming but through drowning.</p><p>Swimming is a surface happening,</p><p><br></p><p>drowning takes you to the depths without end. 119</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>The search for meaning is disastrous;</p><p><br></p><p>it has brought nothing but meaninglessness.</p><p><br></p><p>To see that there is no meaning is to have the real meaning</p><p>where meaninglessness cannot be, where meaning doesn’t matter</p><p>and so its disasters are avoided. What remains just is and what
is,</p><p>is and what is not, is not and that’s all.</p><p><br></p><p>You ask for a clear statement about motivelessness. Your attempt to
understand cannot succeed because it is motivated!</p><p>Why bother about understanding?</p><p><br></p><p>Look, isn’t the thing clear there before you? All things are
open!</p><p>All things are clear!</p><p><br></p><p>But man is so busy understanding no one is left to see what is clear,
what is obvious, what is there! Confusion is the effort to
understand.</p><p>Ignorance is the effort to know.</p><p><br></p><p>If you don’t try to understand or know nothing can hide itself from
you!</p><p>Truth is always in front of you, naked, clear.</p><p>120</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>You say you feel broken.</p><p><br></p><p>It would be better if you broke down completely and disappeared.</p><p>That which is will always be the case</p><p><br></p><p>and that which has become is bound to vanish. Becoming always leads
to dissolution so do not try to save yourself.</p><p>One who loses himself goes beyond life and death, and he who saves
himself is lost.</p><p>You are busy saving yourself</p><p><br></p><p>and that is why you are afraid of breaking down. But what is there to
save?</p><p>And that which is worth saving is already saved. 121</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>You long for the sun</p><p><br></p><p>and you will get it for sure,</p><p><br></p><p>but you have to have the courage to burn! You can’t reach the light
without dying, for ego is darkness,</p><p>and besides, the sun isn’t anywhere outside but is born within when
everything else there</p><p>burns.</p><p><br></p><p>When the self is alight – that is the light. The fear of dying is
darkness,</p><p>the jump into death is the light. Die, and know this!</p><p>Disappear, and you will find it. That is why I say love is prayer –
it is the first lesson in death.</p><p>Regards to all.</p><p><br></p><p>122</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Do not look for a purpose in life but live, and live totally.</p><p>Do not be serious and grave but turn life into a dance.</p><p>Dance – like the waves on the sea! Blossom – like the flowers in
spring! Sing – as the birds do continuously!</p><p>All without purpose, for no reason; then purpose is there, and all
mystery is solved.</p><p>The famous physician Rocky Tonsky once asked a student:</p><p>What is the purpose of life? What is its meaning? The student
hesitated and stammered, as if trying</p><p>to remember, then said: Yesterday I knew, but right now I seem to
have forgotten.</p><p>Rocky Tonsky looked up at the sky and cried: God in heaven!</p><p>The only man who ever knew and now he has forgotten!</p><p>Love to all the family. 123</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>You ask for my ten commandments. This is very</p><p><br></p><p>difficult because I am against any sort of commandment. Yet just for
the fun of it I set down what follows:</p><p>1. Obey no orders except those from within.</p><p><br></p><p>2. The only God is life itself.</p><p><br></p><p>3. Truth is within, do not look for it elsewhere.</p><p><br></p><p>4. Love is prayer.</p><p><br></p><p>5. Emptiness is the door to truth, it is the means, the end and the
achievement.</p><p><br></p><p>6. Life is here and now.</p><p><br></p><p>7. Live fully awake.</p><p><br></p><p>8. Do not swim, float.</p><p><br></p><p>9. Die each moment so that you are renewed each moment.</p><p><br></p><p>10.Stop seeking. That which is, is: STOP AND SEE. 124</p><p>Love.</p><p>The news of the commune delights me. The tree’s seed is
sprouting,</p><p>soon innumerable souls will shelter under its branches.</p><p>Soon the people for whom I have come will gather – and you are going
to be their hostess!</p><p>So prepare yourself; that is,</p><p>empty yourself completely</p><p><br></p><p>because only emptiness can be the host.</p><p><br></p><p>You are already on your way singing, dancing, blissful</p><p>like a river flowing to the sea. I am delighted,</p><p>and I am always with you. The ocean is close –</p><p>just run, run, run!</p><p><br></p><p>125</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Everything changes except change, only change is eternal.</p><p>But the human mind lives in the past – and that is the confusion of
all confusions.</p><p>One day the sky was filled with the clouds of</p><p>war –</p><p><br></p><p>plane upon plane loaded with death. Beasts, birds, worms and beetles
– all that could flee, fled.</p><p>Horses, donkeys, rats, sheep, dogs and cats, wolves –</p><p>all ran for their lives</p><p><br></p><p>and the paths and tracks were full of them. As they fled, this
multitude saw two vultures sitting on a wall by the road.</p><p>Brothers! they cried to them. Flee! At once! Man is on the warpath
again.</p><p>The vultures just smiled. They knew!</p><p><br></p><p>One said: Since time immemorial man’s wars have been good news for
vultures.</p><p>Our ancestors have said so, and so too our scriptures.</p><p>It is also our own experience.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact it is for the benefit of vultures that God sends man to
war!</p><p>– God has made man and war just for vultures!</p><p><br></p><p>This said, the two vultures flew off towards the battle –</p><p><br></p><p>and in the next moment were blown to pieces by falling bombs. If they
had only known how things can change over</p><p>thousands of years</p><p><br></p><p>But does even man himself realize this? 126</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>I received your letter.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t be afraid of sexual desire because fear is the beginning of
defeat. Accept it,</p><p>it is and it has to be.</p><p><br></p><p>Of course, you must know it and recognize it, be aware of it,</p><p>bring it out of the unconscious into the conscious mind.</p><p>You cannot do this if you condemn it because condemnation leads to
repression</p><p>and it is repression that pushes desires and emotions into the
unconscious.</p><p>Really, it is because of repression</p><p><br></p><p>that the mind is divided into conscious and unconscious,</p><p>and this division is at the root of all conflict, and it is this
division that prevents man from being total –</p><p>and without integration there is no way to peace,</p><p>bliss and freedom. So meditate on sexual desire. Whenever the desire
arises,</p><p>watch it mindfully. Do not resist it,</p><p>do not escape from it,</p><p><br></p><p>encountering it leads you to unique experiences. And whatever you
have learned or heard about celibacy –</p><p>throw it once and for all into the dustbin,</p><p><br></p><p>for there is no other way than this of reaching to brahmacharya.</p><p>My regards to all there. 127</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Be like steel – clay will no longer do.</p><p><br></p><p>To be a sannyasin is to be a soldier of God. Serve your parents –
even more than before, give them the joy of a sannyasin son,</p><p>but don’t relent,</p><p><br></p><p>keep your resolution firm,</p><p><br></p><p>it will bring glory to your family.</p><p><br></p><p>The son who compromises with a thing like SANNYAS shames his
family.</p><p>I have complete trust in you,</p><p>that’s why I have been a witness to your SANNYAS. Laugh and go
through everything.</p><p>Listen to everything and laugh. This is your sadhana.</p><p>Let the storms come and go. 128</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>In sannyas, samsara is just a drama; to know the world as a play is
sannyas; then no one is small,</p><p>no one great,</p><p><br></p><p>no Ram and no enemy, Ravan,</p><p><br></p><p>and everything is a ram-leela, God’s play. Whichever part you are
given play it well; the part is not you</p><p>and as long as we identify with our part in the play</p><p>self-knowledge is impossible,</p><p><br></p><p>and from the day that this identification is broken ignorance becomes
impossible.</p><p>Play your part</p><p><br></p><p>but know well it isn’t you.</p><p><br></p><p>129</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p>I have received your letter.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a great difference between love and pity.</p><p><br></p><p>There is pity in love</p><p><br></p><p>but there is no love in pity;</p><p><br></p><p>therefore it is important to know things as they are: love as love,
pity as pity.</p><p>To take one for the other</p><p><br></p><p>is to create unnecessary worry. Ordinarily, love has become
impossible because as he is man cannot be loving:</p><p>to be in love the mind must be completely empty and we love only with
our minds,</p><p>so that when our love is at its lowest it is sex and at its highest
it is compassion,</p><p>but love is a transcendence of both sex and compassion.</p><p>Therefore understand what is</p><p><br></p><p>and do not strive for what should be – what should be</p><p>flows out of the acceptance and understanding of what is.</p><p>130</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>I received your letter.</p><p>Now never worry about me –</p><p><br></p><p>not even mistakenly! For two reasons – first: the day I surrendered
myself for God I transcended all anxiety</p><p>because trying to look after oneself is the only anxiety!</p><p>Ego is anxiety.</p><p><br></p><p>Beyond it: what anxiety? whose? and for whom? Secondly: men like me
are born to be crucified;</p><p>The cross is our throne and our mission is fulfilled</p><p>only when stones are showered, not flowers.</p><p><br></p><p>But on the divine path</p><p><br></p><p>even stones turn into flowers, and on the contrary path</p><p>even flowers turn out to be stones.</p><p><br></p><p>Therefore when the stones start raining on me, be happy and thank
God!</p><p>Truth is always received like this.</p><p><br></p><p>If you don’t agree ask Socrates</p><p>ask Jesus ask Buddha ask Kabir</p><p>ask Meera.</p><p><br></p><p>My regards to all.</p><p><br></p><p>131</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>What does the seed know of its own potential? It is the same with
man,</p><p>he doesn’t know what he is nor what he can be! The seed, perhaps,
cannot look within but man can. This looking in is called
meditation.</p><p>To know one’s truth as it is here and now is meditation.</p><p>Dive into it, deeper and deeper;</p><p><br></p><p>there, in the depths, all that is possible can be clearly seen,</p><p>and once seen it begins to happen –</p><p><br></p><p>the awareness of what is possible turns it into a reality,</p><p>like a seed stirred by a vision of its potential beginning to
sprout.</p><p>Time, effort, energy – pour it all into meditation because meditation
is the gateless gate through which</p><p>the self becomes aware of itself. 132</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Nothing in life is sure – except death, otherwise life is another
name for insecurity.</p><p>When this is realized</p><p><br></p><p>the desire for security simply vanishes;</p><p><br></p><p>to accept insecurity is to become free of it.</p><p><br></p><p>Uncertainty will stay in the mind because that is its nature;</p><p>don’t worry about it</p><p><br></p><p>because that will add fuel to it, just let the mind be, where it is,
and you go into meditation.</p><p>You are not the mind</p><p><br></p><p>so where is the problem of the mind?</p><p><br></p><p>Leave the darkness where it is and just light your lamp.</p><p>Are you going to think carefully and then surrender?</p><p>O mad one! Surrender is a leap outside thought.</p><p><br></p><p>Either jump or don’t jump</p><p><br></p><p>but for God’s sake don’t ponder about it! 133</p><p>Theism is another name for infinite hope. It is patience,</p><p>it is waiting,</p><p><br></p><p>it is trust in leela, in the play of life,</p><p>and therefore with theism complaining cannot be. Theism is
acceptance,</p><p>it is surrender –</p><p><br></p><p>acceptance of what is beyond the self and surrender to the source of
the self.</p><p>In 1914 a fire broke out in Thomas Edison’s laboratory.</p><p>Machinery worth millions</p><p><br></p><p>and all the papers pertaining to his lifelong research</p><p>were burnt to ashes.</p><p><br></p><p>Hearing of this tragedy his son Charles came looking for him</p><p>and he found him standing by the side enjoying the sight of the
leaping flames.</p><p>On seeing Charles, Edison said to him: Where is your mother?</p><p>Go and find her and bring her here quickly; such a sight she will
never see again!</p><p>The next day, walking amidst the ashes of his hopes and dreams,</p><p>the 67 year-old inventor said:</p><p><br></p><p>What benefit there is in destruction!</p><p><br></p><p>All our mistakes have been burnt to ashes, thank God! Now we can
begin afresh all over again!</p><p>God’s grace is endless.</p><p><br></p><p>We just require the eyes to see it. 134</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Wittgenstein has said somewhere:</p><p><br></p><p>Of that which one cannot speak, one should remain silent.</p><p>Oh, if only this advice was heeded</p><p><br></p><p>there would be no useless arguments about truth! THAT-WHICH-IS cannot
be spoken of.</p><p>Whatever is said in words is not, cannot be,</p><p>THAT-WHICH-IS.</p><p><br></p><p>Truth is beyond words,</p><p><br></p><p>only silence is related to truth. But silence is very difficult;</p><p>the mind wants to speak even of that which is beyond words.</p><p>Really, the mind is the only barrier to silence. Silence belongs to
the state of no-mind.</p><p>A preacher came to address some small children. Before beginning he
put a question to them:</p><p>If you were asked to address a gathering of such intelligent boys and
girls</p><p>who expect a good lecture from you, and if you had nothing to speak
on, what would you say?</p><p>A small child replied: I would keep quiet. I would keep quiet.</p><p>This child-like simplicity is needed to experiment with silence.</p><p>135</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>SANNYAS is a pilgrimage to Mt. Everest, naturally there are
difficulties on the way. But the fruits of determination are sweet too,
so bear everything calmly and joyously</p><p>but don’t give up your commitment.</p><p><br></p><p>Serve your mother even more than before – sannyas is not a running
away from responsibility. Your family is not to be given up,</p><p>rather do you have to make the whole world your family. Encourage
your mother to take SANNYAS too,</p><p>tell her: You have seen enough of the world,</p><p>now raise your eyes towards God.</p><p><br></p><p>But make sure she is caused no trouble on your account.</p><p>This doesn’t mean giving in or compromising – sannyas knows no
compromise.</p><p>Strong, bold and resolute is the soul of SANNYAS. 136</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Love does not discriminate even in dreams,</p><p>and in that love which is prayer too, there are no distinctions at
all.</p><p>Now I am no more.</p><p><br></p><p>The word I is simply a convenience and as such causes many
difficulties. When the clouds of the I disappear nothing remains but
love –</p><p>love without cause, unconditional love.</p><p>Here I stand in the marketplace,</p><p><br></p><p>who is ready to come and take it from me?</p><p><br></p><p>KABIR STANDS IN THE MARKETPLACE, TORCH IN HAND.</p><p><br></p><p>IF YOU ARE READY TO BURN YOUR HOUSE DOWN, COME WITH ME. 137</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Ah, if the veena were outside you could hear its music,</p><p>but it is inside</p><p><br></p><p>and we do not hear it.</p><p><br></p><p>But we can become one with it.</p><p><br></p><p>And how much is music worth that ends with listening?</p><p>Finally the musician, the veena, the music, the listener</p><p>are not separate. Look inside,</p><p>go within,</p><p><br></p><p>and see who is waiting there for you. 138</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>The springs of meditation are close at hand</p><p><br></p><p>but the layers of suppressed sex work like rocks.</p><p><br></p><p>The repression of sex has choked your life with anger, its smoke
pervades your whole personality.</p><p>When you were meditating in front of me the other day I saw all this
very clearly,</p><p>but I could also see that your will is very strong too, your thirst
for God is also strong</p><p>and you are working mightily,</p><p><br></p><p>so there is no need to be disheartened. Difficulties are there,</p><p>blocks are there,</p><p><br></p><p>but they will break up</p><p><br></p><p>because the breaker is not yet broken. Meditate totally and soon the
springs will be reached</p><p>But you have to put your whole being at stake – nothing less will
do;</p><p>hold back a bit and you will miss.</p><p><br></p><p>Time is short so gather all your strength; whilst the opportunity is
here</p><p>your effort must be total.</p><p><br></p><p>It is difficult to say whether you will have such an opportunity in
another life,</p><p>so everything must be finished in this one.</p><p><br></p><p>If the gates don’t open this time</p><p><br></p><p>you will have to start from the very beginning next time –</p><p>and then it is far from sure that I will be with you.</p><p><br></p><p>In your last life you worked for it but the work was not
completed;</p><p>and it was the same in the life before that.</p><p>For three lives you have repeated the same cycle again and again
–</p><p>it is time now to break it. It is already late,</p><p>any further delay would be foolish. My regards to all.</p><p>139</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>The meaning of sadhana</p><p><br></p><p>is to enter into one’s own nature, to live in it,</p><p>to be it.</p><p><br></p><p>one must therefore know what is not one’s nature so as to be aware of
what one wants to be free of. Recognizing it becomes freedom from
it.</p><p>A disciple of Bankei asked him:</p><p><br></p><p>I become overwhelmed by anger.</p><p><br></p><p>I want to be rid of it but I cannot be. What shall I do?</p><p>Bankei did not say a word,</p><p><br></p><p>just stared deep into the disciple’s eyes,</p><p><br></p><p>who began to sweat in those few heavy minutes of silence.</p><p>He wanted to break the silence but couldn’t gather</p><p>the courage.</p><p><br></p><p>Then Bankei laughed ant said: It’s strange!</p><p><br></p><p>I searched and searched but could find no anger within you.</p><p>Still, show me a little of it, here and now. The disciple said: It is
not always here.</p><p>It comes all of a sudden, how can I produce it now? Bankei laughed
again and said:</p><p>Then it is not your true nature.</p><p><br></p><p>That remains with you always</p><p><br></p><p>and if your anger had been part of it you could have shown it to
me.</p><p>When you were born it was not with you, when you die it will not be
with you.</p><p>No, this anger is not you. There is a mistake somewhere. Go away and
think again, search again, meditate again. 140</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>God purifies in every way.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not only gold that has to pass through fire to be purified</p><p>but man too.</p><p>For man this fire is the anguish of love.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a blessing when this fire enters a person’s life, it is the
fruit of infinite prayers,</p><p>infinite births.</p><p><br></p><p>It is the intensity of thirst that turns finally into love,</p><p>but unfortunately few are able to welcome it because few can
recognize love in the form of anguish.</p><p>Love is not a throne, it is a cross; but those who gladly offer.</p><p>themselves to it attain the very highest throne. The cross can be
seen, the throne cannot –</p><p>it is always hidden behind the cross. And even Jesus hesitated for a
moment;</p><p>even his heart cried out: FATHER, WHY HAST THOU FORSAKEN ME?</p><p>But the next moment he remembered and said: THY WILL BE DONE.</p><p>That was enough:</p><p><br></p><p>the cross became a throne and death a new life.</p><p>In the moment of revolution between one statement and the next</p><p>Christ descended into Jesus.</p><p><br></p><p>Your suffering is intense and a new birth is at hand; be happy, be
grateful,</p><p>don’t be afraid of death, be thankful,</p><p>it is the tidings of a new birth</p><p><br></p><p>and the old must die to give birth to the new; the seed must break to
blossom into the flower. 141</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>What is suppressed becomes attractive, what is negated, invites!</p><p>Only alertness to the mind’s games brings freedom. Negation does not
really negate,</p><p>on the contrary, it invites.</p><p><br></p><p>The mind plays around the forbidden</p><p><br></p><p>like the tongue around the gap of an extracted tooth.</p><p>A small shopkeeper in London once caused a sensation.</p><p>He hung in his show window</p><p><br></p><p>a black curtain with a small hole at the centre; under the hole was
written in large letters: PEEPING STRICTLY FORBIDDEN.</p><p>Naturally, it brought the traffic to a standstill!</p><p><br></p><p>Crowds gathered around the shop</p><p><br></p><p>jostling one another for a peep through the curtain.</p><p>There they saw nothing but a few towels – it was just a small towel
shop</p><p>and the shopkeeper had devised this sure-fire method of increasing
his sales.</p><p>It worked like magic.</p><p><br></p><p>Man’s mind works the same way and he becomes trapped by it.</p><p>Therefore – always be wary of negation, opposition, suppression .</p><p>142</p><p><br></p><p>Love and blessings. Live the truth,</p><p>for there is no other way to find it. Become the truth,</p><p>for there is no other way to know it. You cannot know truth through
words, not through the scriptures,</p><p>nor through learning, study, contemplation. Truth is within, in the
emptiness within.</p><p>In the state of no-mind,</p><p>in the mind free of desires where only awareness is, there truth
manifests itself.</p><p>Truth simply is,</p><p><br></p><p>it has not to be found, simply uncovered.</p><p>The lid of gold covering it is the ego. Ego is darkness;</p><p>die, and become light!</p><p><br></p><p>Where the darkness of the ego is no more there, in that emptiness,
truth is;</p><p>and that is truth, and that is bliss,</p><p>and that is immortality. Do not seek it,</p><p>just die and it is there. 143</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>I am glad to receive your letter.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, this much suffering has to be gone through – it is the birth
pangs of our own rebirth.</p><p>And going back is not possible</p><p><br></p><p>for where is the past to which to return?</p><p><br></p><p>Time demolishes the steps we climb to reach the present.</p><p>There is no going back –</p><p><br></p><p>only going forward is possible – forward and forward –</p><p>and the journey is endless! There is no goal, no destination, only
resting places –</p><p>where the tents are dismantled as soon as they are pitched.</p><p>But why this fear of anarchy? All systems are false –</p><p>life is anarchic, insecure;</p><p><br></p><p>he who seeks security dies before his death. Why this hurry to
die?</p><p>Death itself will take care of that for us so is it not proper that
we learn to live?</p><p>And the miracle is</p><p><br></p><p>that death does not call on the one who learns how to live –</p><p>and this alone is needed:</p><p><br></p><p>doesn’t the gardener silently wait after sowing the seed?</p><p>Whenever you need me you will find me beside you. Regards to all
there.</p><p>144</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Atheism is the first step towards theism, and a must.</p><p>If you haven’t been through the fire of atheism you’ll never know the
light of theism.</p><p>If you haven’t the true strength to say No your Yes will always be
impotent,</p><p>sol am glad you are an atheist –</p><p><br></p><p>something that can be said only by a theist. So I say: Go deeper into
atheism.</p><p>Superficiality won’t do,</p><p><br></p><p>so don’t just think atheism, live it – and it will ultimately lead
you to God. Atheism isnt IT.</p><p>it is just a doubting.</p><p><br></p><p>Doubt is good but it isn’t IT. Actually, doubt is a search for
trust.</p><p>So go on, take your journey</p><p><br></p><p>for the path to truth starts with this doubt.</p><p><br></p><p>Doubt is sadhana</p><p><br></p><p>because doubt eventually exposes the incontestable truth.</p><p>Inside the seed of doubt is the tree of trust so if you plant the
seed of questioning</p><p>and work on it</p><p><br></p><p>you are bound to harvest trust. And beware all religions!</p><p>Only religions obstruct the true path of RELIGION. 145</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Dreams too are true</p><p><br></p><p>because what we call truth is only a dream –</p><p><br></p><p>it is just the difference between open and closed eyes.</p><p><br></p><p>Understand this fully</p><p><br></p><p>and then one can go beyond both, and the way lies beyond both.</p><p>Both are the seen and beyond both is the seer. 146</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Not only is a seed a seed man is also a seed.</p><p>Not only seeds bloom man also blooms.</p><p>Not only seeds blossom into flowers 147</p><p>How can the search begin unless there is doubt?</p><p><br></p><p>How will the heart stir to know the truth unless there is doubt?</p><p>Remember –</p><p><br></p><p>belief and faith bind man, doubt liberates him.</p><p>148</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>I was glad to receive your letter. Make love your prayer now.</p><p>Love alone is worship, is God.</p><p>Let there be love with every breath this is your only sadhana.</p><p>Sitting, rising, sleeping, waking just remember: LOVE.</p><p>Then you will see that His temple is not far off. 149</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>God is testing you every moment. Laugh and take the test –</p><p>it is beautiful that he considers you worth testing!</p><p><br></p><p>But don’t be in a hurry</p><p><br></p><p>for the more you hurry the more some goals recede, and without doubt
the temple of God is a goal like that</p><p>He who travels with patience travels fastest on this journey. The
mind will roam again and again – that is its way;</p><p>the day its roaming stops it will be dead. Sometimes it sleeps –</p><p>do not mistake this for death:</p><p><br></p><p>sometimes it gets tired –</p><p><br></p><p>don’t mistake this for death either:</p><p><br></p><p>some rest and sleep and it is strong and alive again.</p><p><br></p><p>So stop bothering about it altogether for even this worry gives it
strength. Surrender even this to God.</p><p>Say to Him: Whatever it’s like, good or bad, take care of it –</p><p>and then just be a witness, simply watch the whole play.</p><p>Watch the play of the mind with detachment and then suddenly –</p><p>there is the consciousness which is no-mind. 150</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>God is far off</p><p><br></p><p>because we don’t know how to see Him close by. Actually there is
nothing closer than Him.</p><p>more than that – He is the here and now.</p><p><br></p><p>The name God is just for those who can’t find the here and now.</p><p>Words, names, doctrines, scriptures, religion, philosophy –</p><p>all these are created for those who can see Him only at a
distance.</p><p>Hence they have no connection with God but only with those who are
blind to the near. That’s why I say,: Drop the distant.</p><p>Drop paradises in the sky. Drop salvations in the future.</p><p>and see the near in time and in space. Be here and now and see!</p><p>See the instant in time. see the atom in space.</p><p>In the time moment time ceases to exist. In the space atom space
ceases to exist. I here is no space, no time, here and now. What is left
is truth,</p><p>is God, is that.</p><p>You too are that.</p><p><br></p><p>TAT TWAM ASI – that art thou. 151</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>The word is not the thing.</p><p>the word God is not God,</p><p><br></p><p>but the mind goes on accumulating words and words and words,</p><p>and then the words become the barrier. See this as a fact with
you:</p><p>can you see anything without the word can you feel anything without
the word.</p><p>can you live even for a single moment without the word? Do not think
but see.</p><p>and then you will be in meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>To exist wordlessly is to be in meditation. 152</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Always see WHAT IS. The facts.</p><p>THAT WHICH IS.</p><p><br></p><p>Do not project anything, do not interpret,</p><p>do not impose any meaning</p><p><br></p><p>that is, do not allow your mind to interfere – and you will begin to
encounter reality.</p><p>Otherwise everyone lives in his own world of dreaming.</p><p>And meditation is coming out of these worlds,</p><p>these dreaming patterns.</p><p><br></p><p>A philosopher stopped Mulla Nasrudin on the street.</p><p><br></p><p>In order to test whether the Mulla</p><p><br></p><p>was sensitive to philosophical knowledge he made a sign, pointing at
the sky.</p><p>The philosopher meant: There is only one truth, which covers all.</p><p>Nasrudin’s companion, an ordinary man, thought: The philosopher is
mad.</p><p>I wonder what precautions Nasrudin will take. Nasrudin looked in his
knapsack and took out a coil of rope.</p><p>This he handed to his companion. Excellent, thought the
companion.</p><p>We will bind him up if he becomes violent. The philosopher saw that
Nasrudin meant:</p><p>Ordinary humanity tries to find truth by methods as unsuitable as
attempting to climb into the sky with a rope.</p><p>Now can you remain content with the fact</p><p><br></p><p>of Mulla Nasrudin giving the rope to his companion without any
interpretation whatsoever?</p><p>Remain with the fact, and you will be in meditation.</p><p>153</p><p><br></p><p>The ego is necessary</p><p><br></p><p>for both the sensation of pain and the feeling of pleasure:</p><p>and vice versa also –</p><p><br></p><p>the sensation of pain and the feeling of pleasure are necessary for
the existence of the ego.</p><p>In fact these are two sides of the same coin. The name of the coin is
ignorance.</p><p>Understand this</p><p><br></p><p>and do not fight with the ego or with pain and pleasure</p><p>because unless ignorance is gone they will not go, they cannot go,
and you cannot fight with ignorance</p><p>because ignorance is just absence of something – absence of
yourself.</p><p>So be present to your ignorance, be aware of it,</p><p>and then you will be and there will be no ignorance because you and
ignorance cannot exist simultaneously,</p><p>as with light and darkness. 154</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>A small boy</p><p><br></p><p>with a penny clutched tightly in his hot little hand entered the
toyshop</p><p>and drove the proprietor to distraction asking him to show this and
that</p><p>and everything</p><p><br></p><p>without ever making up his mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Look here, my boy, said the storekeeper finally. What do you want to
buy for a penny –</p><p>the whole world with a fence around it?</p><p><br></p><p>The boy thought for a moment and then replied: Let us see it.</p><p>And I say to you that ordinarily</p><p><br></p><p>no one is different from that small boy in this world.</p><p>But unless one is different, one is not mature. And maturity does not
come with age alone, maturity comes through understanding the
distinction</p><p>between that which is possible and that which is not possible.
155</p><p>Love.</p><p>Things go on changing without. You must mirror them,</p><p>you must reflect them,</p><p><br></p><p>but remember always that the mirror remains the same. Mirroring does
not change the mirror.</p><p>Do not be identified with mirroring. Remember yourself as the mirror
– that is what is meant by witnessing. And witnessing is meditation.</p><p>Lieh-Tzu exhibited his skill in archery to Po-Hun Wu-Jen.</p><p>When the bow was drawn to its full length a cup of water was placed
on his elbow and he began to shoot.</p><p>As soon as the first arrow was let fly</p><p><br></p><p>a second one was already on the string and a third followed.</p><p>In the meantime he stood unmoved like a statue.</p><p><br></p><p>Po-Hun Wu-Jen said: The technique of your shooting is fine, but it is
still a technique.</p><p>You look only like a statue from without.</p><p><br></p><p>Now let us go up to a high mountain</p><p><br></p><p>and stand on a rock projecting over a precipice and then you try to
shoot.</p><p>They climbed up a mountain.</p><p><br></p><p>Standing on a rock projecting over a precipice ten thousand feet
high</p><p>Po-Hun Wu-Jen stepped backward</p><p><br></p><p>until one third of his feet were hanging over the rock. He then
motioned to Lieh-Tzu to come forward.</p><p>Lieh-Tzu fell to the ground</p><p><br></p><p>with perspiration flowing down to his heels. Po-Hun Wu-Jen said:</p><p>The perfect man soars up above the blue sky or dives down to the
yellow springs,</p><p>or wanders about all over the eight limits of the world,</p><p>yet shows no signs of change in his spirit.</p><p><br></p><p>But you betray a sign of trepidation and your eyes are dazed.</p><p>HOW CAN YOU EXPECT TO HIT THE TARGET? 156</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Do you want to ask questions? Or do you want to get answers?</p><p>Because if you want to ask questions then you will not get
answers,</p><p>and if you want to get answers</p><p>then you cannot be allowed to ask questions – because the answer is
in that consciousness where the questions have not yet been raised, or
have been uprooted and thrown out.</p><p>157</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>I hope you will be moving in deep meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>Breathe in it sleep in it live in it –</p><p>let meditation be your very existence. Only then is the
happening.</p><p>Don’t do it, but be it –</p><p><br></p><p>And my blessings are always with you.</p><p><br></p><p>If you need any help from me just ask when you are thoughtLESS,</p><p>and it will be given to yon. 158</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>A madman entered the bazaar and declaimed: The moon is more useful
than the sun.</p><p>But why? asked someone.</p><p><br></p><p>We need the light more</p><p><br></p><p>during the night than during the day, he said.</p><p>And I say to you that</p><p><br></p><p>all our metaphysical theories and explanations are not of more worth
than the explanation of that madman.</p><p>159</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Ask for nothing and you will never be frustrated. Anticipate darkness
with light and sorrow with happiness because such is the nature of
things.</p><p>Then you will never be frustrated.</p><p><br></p><p>Say to life: What can you do to me? I want nothing! And say to death:
What can you do to me? I have already died!</p><p>Then you will be truly free</p><p><br></p><p>because unless one is free of life one can never be free of
death.</p><p>And when one is free of both</p><p><br></p><p>one knows that life which is eternity itself. 160</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Man is an everlack,</p><p><br></p><p>because he desires without knowing himself, because he desires to
become something without knowing his being,</p><p>and this is absurd.</p><p><br></p><p>First one must know his being otherwise there will be anguish.</p><p>Becoming is anguish</p><p><br></p><p>because it is a constant tension</p><p><br></p><p>between that which is and that which should be – and it is an
impossible longing also</p><p>because only that can be which is. So know yourself as you are
without any ideals,</p><p>without any judgement</p><p><br></p><p>and without any condemnation.</p><p><br></p><p>Go deep within yourself without any desires to become because only
then can you know yourself.</p><p>Discover yourself,</p><p><br></p><p>not according to anybody else, but as you are.</p><p>Discover the fact, discover the real</p><p>in its total nakedness. In this total authenticity just be a
witness,</p><p>and then there is an altogether different quality to life, the
quality of let go.</p><p>Then one is relaxed totally.</p><p><br></p><p>And all flowering is in relaxation, and all benediction.</p><p>161</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Fear cripples consciousness,</p><p><br></p><p>and fear is the source of unconsciousness, that is why without
transcending fear</p><p>no one can attain to full consciousness. But what is fear?</p><p>Fear is awareness of death without knowing what death is.</p><p>Fear exists in the gap between you and your death, and if there is no
gap, no space,</p><p>then there is no fear.</p><p><br></p><p>Do not think of death as something outside you because it is not.</p><p>And do not think of death as something in the future</p><p>because it is not.</p><p><br></p><p>Death is within you,</p><p><br></p><p>because death is the other side of life. Life cannot exist without
death;</p><p>they both belong to the same energy as positive and</p><p>negative poles.</p><p><br></p><p>So do not identify yourself with life – because you are both.</p><p>The identification with life creates the gap. And death has nothing
to do with the future – it is always here and now.</p><p>Every moment, it is.</p><p><br></p><p>And when one ceases to regard it as something outside oneself</p><p>and, so to speak, draws it into his consciousness and assimilates the
idea of it,</p><p>one is completely changed. He is in all truth born again. And then
there is no fear because then there is no gap. 162</p><p>Thinking is necessary but not enough, one must know living also,</p><p>otherwise one becomes like the philosopher mentioned by Soren
Kierkegaard</p><p>who builds a fine palace</p><p><br></p><p>but is doomed not to live in it – he has a shed for himself</p><p>next door to what he has constructed for others,</p><p>including himself, to look at!</p><p>Meditation is not thinking, but living Live it daily, moment to
moment; that is, live in it or let it live in you.</p><p>It is not something other-worldly either, because all such
distinctions are from the mind: they are speculative and not
existential,</p><p>and meditation is existential.</p><p><br></p><p>It is no more than one’s everyday life lived totally. When Mencius
says: The truth is near and people seek it far away,</p><p>he means this.</p><p><br></p><p>When Tokusan is asked about it he replies: When you are hungry you
eat,</p><p>when you are thirsty you drink,</p><p><br></p><p>and when you meet a friend you greet him. He means this.</p><p>Sings Ho Koji: How wondrous this, how mysterious! I carry fuel, I
draw water.</p><p>He also means this.</p><p><br></p><p>And when you are near me</p><p><br></p><p>whatsoever I may say I always mean this. Or I may not say anything
–</p><p>but then too I always mean this. 163</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Religion is so much an experience</p><p><br></p><p>that it cannot be handed over by one to another. But there are
traditions of religious experience – which are bound to be false</p><p>because of the very nature of the religious experience.</p><p>One has to travel the path alone</p><p><br></p><p>with no footprints of other travellers even to guide.</p><p>Hasan of Basra was asked: What is Islam and who are the Muslims?</p><p>He is reported to have said:</p><p><br></p><p>Islam is in the books</p><p><br></p><p>and Muslims? Muslims are in the tombs. 164</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>The world itself is a punishment enough, so really there is no need
for hell at all.</p><p>Once a man who had married three wives was brought before the king of
the country for punishment.</p><p>The king called in his counsellors and asked them to devise</p><p>the worst possible punishment for the offender, even death
itself.</p><p>But they did not order his execution,</p><p><br></p><p>ruling instead that it would be still worse for him to live with all
three wives at the same time.</p><p>Two weeks later the man committed suicide. 165</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>I have no special doctrine or philosophy, no set of concepts or
intellectual formulas, but only certain irrational devices</p><p>through which I can push you into the unknown.</p><p><br></p><p>I do not believe in any theories or any systems of thought,</p><p>but I have faith in certain existential situations through which I
can throw you into the unknown. Intellectual understanding is not
understanding at all but only a deception.</p><p>Understanding is always of the total, of the whole being.</p><p>Intellect is only a part, and that too a minor one, but it plays as
the whole</p><p>and thereby creates all sorts of stupidities. Do not be identified
with your intellect.</p><p>Dissolve it into the whole of your being,</p><p><br></p><p>and then you will know what understanding is – and the bliss and the
ecstasy that follow it inevitably.</p><p>166</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation is a mirror – and the most faithful one.</p><p>Whoever goes into meditation risks a confrontation with himself:</p><p>The mirror of meditation never lies, and it does not flatter.</p><p>It is impartial and innocent and it never projects anything.</p><p>It only faithfully shows your real original face, the face we never
show to the world,</p><p>the face that we ourselves have forgotten.</p><p><br></p><p>So it is possible that you yourself</p><p>may not be able to recognize it the first time! But do not escape
from it.</p><p>Face it and you will come to know it and recognize it.</p><p>This confrontation is the first test of courage on the inner way.</p><p>So when it comes to happen – rejoice and feel blessed.</p><p>167</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, there is tension.</p><p><br></p><p>To be consciously conscious is to be tense, but it is not because of
consciousness</p><p>but because of partial consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>The unconscious is always behind the so called consciousness –</p><p>this situation creates tension because this creates a dichotomy, a
duality;</p><p>hence the tension,</p><p><br></p><p>because the being is divided – which cannot be divided.</p><p>Hence the tension,</p><p><br></p><p>The unnaturality of the situation is the root cause of this
tension,</p><p>and for that matter of all tensions, because then one is not
individual, that is, indivisible;</p><p>therefore there is tension,</p><p><br></p><p>and one cannot really relax unless one is ONE. Either be totally
unconscious as in deep and dreamless sleep –</p><p>and then there is no tension, or be totally conscious –</p><p>and then you are in the state of no-tension because the total can
never be tense.</p><p>That is why the whole is the holy.</p><p><br></p><p>But falling into deep sleeplike trance is just escaping the
problem,</p><p>and that too only for the time being, because you will be back soon –
and worse,</p><p>because by such escapes</p><p><br></p><p>the gap between the conscious and the unconscious is not bridged</p><p>but, on the contrary, widened even more. One becomes split and
schizophrenic.</p><p>So always be aware of the mind</p><p><br></p><p>because it tries to find solace in unconscious states in so many ways
–</p><p>through chemical drugs, through auto-hypnotic means,</p><p>and otherwise.</p><p><br></p><p>Begin to be aware of anything</p><p><br></p><p>which ordinarily happens unconsciously, for example – anger,
jealousy, pride –</p><p>and your consciousness will be deepened. Act consciously,</p><p>even in day-to-day acts be conscious, for example – walking, eating,
talking –</p><p>and your consciousness will be expanded. Be alert when thinking.</p><p>No thought should be allowed to pass unwitnessed.</p><p><br></p><p>And then, in the end, there is explosion in which you become totally
conscious with no unconsciousness behind.</p><p>When this happens one is one, and to be one is to be silent.</p><p>This silence is beyond time and space, because it is beyond
duality.</p><p>168</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>God is when you are not.</p><p><br></p><p>When you are IT IS not</p><p><br></p><p>because YOU are nothing but a blindness. The ego cannot see.</p><p>the ego cannot be aware,</p><p><br></p><p>the ego exists only as a by-product of unconscious living. One goes
on living as if in sleep.</p><p>In this sleep the part begins to dream itself as the whole,</p><p>and this dreaming becomes a barrier to knowing the whole. Begin to be
aware,</p><p>aware of your actions, thoughts and emotions, just aware.</p><p>Because if you condemn or appreciate you will not be aware –</p><p>in any choice the awareness is contaminated and the darkness of
unawareness comes in, so just be aware without any choice;</p><p>then awareness is pure and innocent, and then awareness is a
mirror.</p><p>In this mirror-like awareness one never finds oneself but one finds
THAT-WHICH-IS.</p><p>And that is God.</p><p><br></p><p>But it is only when you are not</p><p><br></p><p>because you are the dust which makes the mirror blind. Because you
are the blindness.</p><p>169</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p>There are three forms of knowledge. The first is intellectual
knowledge,</p><p>which is in fact not knowledge but information only, and the
collection of facts and the use of these</p><p>to arrive at further intellectual concepts. The second is emotional
knowledge which also is really not knowledge</p><p>but feeling of the mental states in which man feels he has known
something,</p><p>but there is no transformation or mutation of his being.</p><p>The first is objective and out of it science is born,</p><p><br></p><p>and the second is subjective and is the source of all art. The third
is neither;</p><p>it is beyond both,</p><p><br></p><p>and this third is the real.</p><p><br></p><p>It is achieved through meditation</p><p><br></p><p>because meditation does not use thinking and feeling as doors of
perception –</p><p>really these are not doors of perception but forces of
projection;</p><p>through them pure knowing is impossible, whatsoever comes through
them is changed and coloured by them.</p><p>So unless one is free from all projections one cannot know
THAT-WHICH-IS.</p><p>When there are no ripples of thought and emotion in the
consciousness, then and only then</p><p>dawns the third form of knowledge,</p><p><br></p><p>and this third is the only real knowledge. Out of it religion is
born,</p><p>and out of it is total transformation. 170</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>The journey is long</p><p><br></p><p>and the path is pathless – and one has to be alone.</p><p>There is no map and no one to guide. But there is no alternative</p><p>One cannot escape it, one cannot evade it.</p><p>One has to go on the journey.</p><p><br></p><p>The goal seems impossible</p><p><br></p><p>but the urge to go on it is intrinsic. THE NEED IS DEEP IN THE
SOUL.</p><p>Really, you are the urge, you are the need – and consciousness cannot
be otherwise because of this challenge</p><p>and because of this adventure. So do not waste time – begin. Do not
calculate – begin.</p><p>Do not hesitate – begin. Do not look back – begin.</p><p>And always remember old Lao Tzu’s words: A tree that takes both arms
to encircle grows from a tiny rootlet.</p><p>A many-storied pagoda</p><p><br></p><p>is built by placing one brick upon another brick. A journey of three
thousand miles is begun by a single step.</p><p>171</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>When I say mutation I do not mean simply change. Change is from the
known to the known:</p><p>a sinner becomes a saint –</p><p><br></p><p>then it is change and not mutation.</p><p><br></p><p>You can practise change but you cannot practise mutation because only
the known can be practised –</p><p>and then any change is going to be only a modified past because the
past will be continuous in it,</p><p>and the past also will be the master of it because it is cultivated
by the past.</p><p>In other words, change is from this to that, it is a movement in the
known.</p><p>But mutation is explosion:</p><p><br></p><p>from THIS to nothingness, from here to nowhere.</p><p>You cannot practise it –</p><p><br></p><p>on the contrary, you are the only hindrance. So what is to be
done.</p><p>Really nothing can be done. Be aware of this helplessness,</p><p>and remain in this helplessness.</p><p><br></p><p>Do not do anything because any doing</p><p>will be escaping from this fact of helplessness. Do not move at all
–</p><p>and then there is explosion, and then there is mutation. 172</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Religion is not a promise for the future but an experience HERE AND
NOW. But through priesthood it has become promises and promises and
promises. At an examination of a class in First Aid</p><p>a member, who was also a priest, was asked: What would you do if you
found a man in a fainting condition?</p><p>I would give him some brandy, was the answer. And if there was no
brandy? he was then asked. I would promise him some, replied the
priest.</p><p>173</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Wherever there are words there is no real meaning. But here also are
words?</p><p>Then what to do?</p><p><br></p><p>READ BETWEEN THE WORDS.</p><p><br></p><p>Or read that which is said but not written, or that which is shown
and not even said, or that which is meant and not even shown. That is –
LOOK IN,</p><p>because the words are without but the meaning is within.</p><p>174</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Reason is not enough;</p><p><br></p><p>it is necessary but not enough.</p><p><br></p><p>The beyond must be remembered – and always, because reason in itself
is destructive;</p><p>alone, it is nothing but a cutting weapon. It creates a man anti-all
and pro-nothing.</p><p>It creates absolutely negative minds which can criticize but cannot
create,</p><p>because reason has no healing force within itself; it is only a tiny
part and not the whole of life</p><p>amd the healing force is always with the whole. 175</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>With thought the mind has boundaries</p><p><br></p><p>but without thought the mind is just infinite space.</p><p>That is why in thoughtless awareness one stops being a drop</p><p>and becomes oceanic.</p><p><br></p><p>And then there is great energy.</p><p><br></p><p>This energy wipes out everything which is dead. It wipes out the
whole karmic past –</p><p>and with no effort at all.</p><p><br></p><p>The greater absorbs the lesser and remains untouched.</p><p>176</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>The will to wholeness is inherent in everything,</p><p>but only in man has it become conscious. Therefore man lives in
tension,</p><p>and only when this longing is fulfilled</p><p><br></p><p>is his negative state of tension wiped out.</p><p><br></p><p>The tension is symbolic of the infinite potential and also of the
infinite possibilities.</p><p>Man is not what he can be,</p><p><br></p><p>and unless he is that which he can be he cannot be at ease.</p><p>This dis-ease is man,</p><p><br></p><p>and health is in wholeness.</p><p><br></p><p>The fact that language has one root for the words whole, holy and to
heal conceals a deep truth:</p><p>He who is whole is also healed, and to be healed is to be whole.</p><p>This wholeness can only be achieved</p><p><br></p><p>by becoming totally conscious of oneself:</p><p><br></p><p>The darkness of the unconscious is to be penetrated and transformed
into light.</p><p>And meditation is the method. 177</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>The new world revealed in meditation</p><p>is not something added from the outside. It has always been there –
within,</p><p>is in being itself. It IS being itself.</p><p>One may know it or not, but it is THERE – as a seed of course, as a
potentiality,</p><p>one has to make it actual, that is all. That is why when it is
revealed, when it flowers,</p><p>one laughs uproariously</p><p><br></p><p>because it has always been there and one never knew it. To work
towards meditation is just like sculpturing because just as the sculptor
chisels out a figure</p><p>deeply buried in a mass of inert matter. so the meditator transforms
his won inert potentialities.</p><p>into living, dynamic and conscious creations. of course, here</p><p>the creator and the creation and the means of creation are not
different but one</p><p>because the meditator himself is all.</p><p><br></p><p>And that is why I call meditation the greatest art. 178</p><p>Love.</p><p>Do not think of others and waste your time;</p><p><br></p><p>really, that is a subtle and cunning way of the mind to escape from
itself.</p><p>Once a monk asked Ummon:</p><p><br></p><p>Sir, you always say that Buddhism helps us in every possible way,</p><p>but how can it help the blind, the deaf or the dumb? The blind cannot
see the teacher’s staff that is raised before them,</p><p>the deaf cannot hear the teacher’s words, no matter how wise,</p><p>the dumb cannot ask their questions or speak their understanding:</p><p>so since we cannot help these people</p><p><br></p><p>how can we say that Buddhism helps in every possible way?</p><p>What good is it?</p><p><br></p><p>Ummon just remained silent for a while</p><p><br></p><p>and then abruptly poked at the questioner with his stick. The monk of
course jumped back.</p><p>Ah! said Ummon. I see you are not blind!</p><p><br></p><p>Then he told the monk to come forward, which he did. Ah-ha! said
Ummon. I see you are not deaf!</p><p>Then he asked the monk</p><p>if he understood what all this to-do was about. The monk said he did
not.</p><p>Ah-ha! said Ummon. I see you are not dumb! 179</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation does not require any application of the mind or use of
effort.</p><p>It descends upon you as effortlessly as sleep. You cannot try to
sleep,</p><p>nor can you try to meditate. On the contrary,</p><p>every effort hinders its smooth and silent coming. There is no place
in it for action or aggression – and action is ways aggressive.</p><p>Meditation is passive receptivity. Mind is aggressive,</p><p>meditation is passive.</p><p><br></p><p>Be passive nd receptive and open</p><p>and vulnerable and WAIT.</p><p>The real miracle happens through waiting. The moment that waiting is
total</p><p>there is happening,</p><p><br></p><p>and – THE EXPLOSION. 180</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>The problem of life is not philosophical, it is existential.</p><p>You cannot solve it from the outside; you cannot just be a spectator
to it – you are in it – you ARE IT.</p><p>And moreover, what is philosophy?</p><p><br></p><p>At the worst a linguistic misunderstanding, or at best a linguistic
analysis.</p><p>And even at its best it leads nowhere because the problem is
existential</p><p>and it cannot be solved through language analysis and grammar.</p><p>One dark night a dervish was passing a dry well when he heard a cry
for help from below.</p><p>What is the matter? he called down. I am a grammarian,</p><p>and I have unfortunately fallen,</p><p><br></p><p>due to my ignorance of the path, into this deep well,</p><p><br></p><p>in which I am now all but immobilized, responded the other. Hold,
friend, and I’ll fetch a ladder and a rope,</p><p>said the dervish.</p><p><br></p><p>One moment please! said the grammarian. Your grammar and diction are
faulty.</p><p>Be good enough to amend them.</p><p><br></p><p>If that is so much more important than the essentials, shouted the
dervish, you had best stay where you are until I have learned to speak
properly.</p><p>And he went his way. 181</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>don’t think about surrender at all</p><p><br></p><p>because that which thinks about it is the only barrier,</p><p>and therefore no one can surrender: it is not a doing at all.</p><p>It happens,</p><p><br></p><p>you cannot go to it, it comes to you.</p><p>And any effort on your part will hinder its coming. Be open and
effortless, relaxed and passive,</p><p>and it will come – it always comes I am a witness to it.</p><p>182</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p>Mulla Nasrudin was searching for something on the ground. What have
you lost, Mulla? someone who saw him searching, asked. My key, said the
Mulla. So they both went down on their knees and looked for it. After
a</p><p>time the other man asked: Where exactly did you drop it? In my house,
said the Mulla.</p><p>Then why are you looking here?</p><p><br></p><p>There is more light here than inside my house.</p><p><br></p><p>I ask you also – where are you looking for the key? Inside the
house?</p><p>Or out there, where there is more light? 183</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no end to man’s self-deception, because whatsoever he is
going to do he can rationalize it.</p><p>One day one man boasted in the bar that he is a man of iron WILL,</p><p>and now he will show it</p><p><br></p><p>by not touching wine again in his life. But not even that day could
pass.</p><p>In the evening he came to the bar and said loudly for all to hear
–</p><p>I am stronger than my willpower.</p><p><br></p><p>I fought the whole day and finally conquered my</p><p>damn willpower!</p><p><br></p><p>A double scotch, please!</p><p><br></p><p>184</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>The way of meditation is above the self; its base is
surrendering.</p><p>Surrender the self to your own no-self; Be as if you are not.</p><p>Oh, the benediction</p><p><br></p><p>when one just leaves everything to the no-self!</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha called this phenomenon anatma or anatta (no-selfhood).</p><p><br></p><p>One must turn oneself into a puppet in the hands of the no-self,</p><p>and then everything begins to flow naturally and spontaneously</p><p>just like a river flowing to the sea</p><p><br></p><p>or like a cloud wandering in the sky. Lao-tzu says this is doing by
non-doing.</p><p>One ceases to be one’s own master</p><p><br></p><p>and becomes an instrument of the unknown – and what nonsense it is to
be one’s own master because there is no one to be so!</p><p>Do not search and you will continue to believe in it. Search and it
is nowhere to be found.</p><p>The self exists only in ignorance. It IS ignorance.</p><p>In knowing there is nos elf because there is no knower.</p><p>Then knowing is enough unto itself. 185</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>There is conflict in the mind – always,</p><p>because the mind cannot exist without the conflict. It gets
strengthened through conflict;</p><p>even warring against conflict is conflict</p><p><br></p><p>and struggling to go beyond the mind is mind.</p><p><br></p><p>See this deeply and immediately without motive,</p><p>just as if you have come across a snake in the street – and the
jump.</p><p>Then it is not that you jump but – the jump.</p><p>The jump happens spontaneously without effort</p><p>and without conflict.</p><p><br></p><p>When this happens there is no-mind and no-mind is the door to the
divine.</p><p>186</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>In meditation, enjoy doing nothing.</p><p><br></p><p>Be in a state of perfectly quiet passivity – then you are in harmony
with the world.</p><p>The thought-forms dissolve automatically because they cannot exist
with total passivity: they are forms of an activity-addicted mind, and
with them dissolves the ego –</p><p>because it cannot exist without thought-forms.</p><p><br></p><p>The ego is nothing but</p><p><br></p><p>a whirlpool centre of constantly revolving thought-forms.</p><p>Remain in passivity,</p><p><br></p><p>that is, in the state of absolute doing-nothingness,</p><p>and meditation deepens to the depths where there is no meditator;</p><p>and remember that only when there is no meditator has meditation
really come into being.</p><p>If you are then there is no meditation, and when there is meditation
you are not. 187</p><p>It is tragic but true that few people ever possess</p><p>their souls.</p><p><br></p><p>They possess everything except themselves, and then naturally they
just become a thing among their other things.</p><p>The possessor becomes the possessed. Nothing is more rare in any man,
says Emerson, than an act of his own.</p><p>But this is just what can be expected because no one is one’s
own,</p><p>no one is oneself.</p><p><br></p><p>Most people are other people.</p><p><br></p><p>They are not living</p><p><br></p><p>but only acting roles given to them by others. Their thoughts are
someone else’s opinions and their faces are just masks.</p><p>They are faceless.</p><p><br></p><p>They have no authentic being at all.</p><p><br></p><p>Their lives – a mimicry</p><p><br></p><p>and their passions – a quotation.</p><p><br></p><p>Break this vicious circle otherwise you will never BE.</p><p>Break this through meditation –</p><p><br></p><p>and it cannot be broken by anything else because through mind it
cannot be broken,</p><p>and except for meditation, all else is mind. Mind is the prison,</p><p>meditation, the door. And the only door.</p><p>188</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Only God is –</p><p><br></p><p>that is why it is so difficult to find Him, and God is everywhere
–</p><p>that is why He seems to be nowhere, and the seeker is the sought
–</p><p>that is why all seeking is so futile. Stop and see.</p><p>But the mind is running constantly. Do not be, and see.</p><p>But the mind is trying to be continuously. Says Auden:</p><p>For the garden is the only place there is, but you will not find
it.</p><p>Until you have looked for it everywhere and found nowhere that is not
a desert; The miracle is the only thing that happens, but to you it will
not be apparent,</p><p>Until all events have been studied</p><p>and nothing happens that you cannot explain; And life is the destiny
you are bound to refuse until you have consented to die.</p><p>STOP AND SEE.</p><p><br></p><p>DO NOT BE, AND SEE.</p><p><br></p><p>189</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Live in the body intimately and deeply.</p><p><br></p><p>Feel the body more and let the body feel more.</p><p><br></p><p>It is astonishing how many people</p><p><br></p><p>are almost completely unaware of themselves physically. The body is
suppressed and denied life too much,</p><p>that is why it is just a dead weight and not a living joy.</p><p>That is why I insist: be back in the body</p><p><br></p><p>and regain the wonderful joy in its movements, sheer movements.</p><p>Make it a meditation and you will be enriched beyond
comprehension.</p><p>190</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>John Burroughs remembers:</p><p><br></p><p>One day my boy killed what an old hunter told him was a mock
duck.</p><p>It looked like a duck, it acted like a duck,</p><p>but when it came on the table – it mocked us!</p><p>Remember to make a clearcut distinction between your self and your
mock-selves – the masks,</p><p>otherwise in the end they will all mock you! 191</p><p>Love</p><p><br></p><p>Man is strange, very strange,</p><p><br></p><p>because he begins by deceiving others and ends with deceiving
himself.</p><p>A fakir was walking down the village street deep in thought when some
urchins began to throw stones at him.</p><p>He was taken by surprise,</p><p><br></p><p>and besides he was not a big man. Don’t do that, he said, and I will
tell you something of interest to you.</p><p>All right, what is it? But no philosophy.</p><p><br></p><p>The king is giving a free banquet to all comers – he just lied to
them.</p><p>The children ran off towards the king’s palace as the fakir warmed to
his theme –</p><p>the delicacies and delights of the entertainment... He looked up and
saw them disappearing in the distance,</p><p>and then suddenly he tucked up his robes and started to sprint after
them</p><p>I had better go and see, he panted to himself, because it might he
true after all.</p><p>192</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>To be religious is to be a yea-sayer: yes to everything –</p><p>yes to life and yes to death,</p><p><br></p><p>yes to light and yes to darkness. Total acceptance is religion.</p><p>Says Nicolas De Cusa: Yes God! Yes God! Yes, yes and always yes</p><p>Say YES – and feel it,</p><p><br></p><p>and you have entered the temple of the divine. Say no and you
yourself have closed the doors – or closed yourself to the divine.</p><p>No is suicidal, no is poisonous – know this and be a yea-sayer.</p><p>Let your heart say yes with every beat. Breathe YES in and out</p><p>and you will feel the divine all around you within and without.</p><p>He is always present but He cannot enter through a NO sign,</p><p>He cannot trespass on you.</p><p><br></p><p>With a no you are an ego</p><p><br></p><p>but with a yes you are just egolessness.</p><p><br></p><p>Ego is a Leibnizian monad without any doors or windows,</p><p>and egolessness is the gate.</p><p><br></p><p>Be a gate – the divine is waiting to enter you from eternity.</p><p>193</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Begin to live positively, that is – with positive emotions.</p><p>To be negative is to be self-destructive and ultimately suicidal.</p><p>But ordinarily the mind works that way</p><p><br></p><p>because it is only an instrument for safety and security; it detects
death only and not life.</p><p>So to be completely positive is to transcend mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Some fakir was asked to talk to a group about the negative nature of
the mind.</p><p>He tacked up on the wall a large sheet of perfectly white paper.</p><p>He made a black spot in the paper with a pencil. Then he asked each
man to say what he saw.</p><p>Each man replied: A black spot.</p><p><br></p><p>The fakir then said: Yes, there is a little black spot.</p><p>But not one of you saw the big expanse of white paper</p><p>and that is the point of my speech. 194</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>The forms of existence are finite – all forms.</p><p>Really, to have a form means to be finite.</p><p><br></p><p>But existence is infinite</p><p><br></p><p>because only the formless can be infinite and existence is
formlessness,</p><p>that is why it can take all the forms.</p><p><br></p><p>But to take form in any way is to allow death in because form is a
death sentence</p><p>whilst existence itself is eternal life. Do not be identified with
the form:</p><p>this identification creates the fear of death</p><p>– in fact, all fear.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember the formless</p><p><br></p><p>and you will know immortality because you will be that – then.
195</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>The attitude is everything. Negative attitudes negate life –</p><p>they are good for dying but not good for living. Life needs positive
attitudes;</p><p>life feeds on them</p><p><br></p><p>because they make you not only happy but creative also.</p><p>Once there lived an old woman,</p><p><br></p><p>but the older she became the younger she felt – because youthfulness
has nothing to do with age, it is an attitude,</p><p>and with age and its richness</p><p><br></p><p>one can really be younger than the young. The old woman was so
cheerful and creative that everyone wondered at her.</p><p>But you must have some clouds in your life. said a visitor. Clouds?
she replied. Why, of course:</p><p>if there were no clouds</p><p>where would the blessed showers come from In the presence of trouble
–</p><p>and there are troubles in life – the positive mind grows wings but
others buy crutches.</p><p>Grow wings, and do not buy crutches. 196</p><p>There is no security in life</p><p><br></p><p>because life cannot exist except as insecurity – that is why the more
secure one is</p><p>the less alive one becomes.</p><p><br></p><p>Death is complete security</p><p><br></p><p>so never be in search of security because you are searching for
death.</p><p>To live totally and in ecstasy never demands security.</p><p>Accept insecurity blissfully and when you accept it</p><p>then you will know that it has a beauty of its own.</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla Nasrudin’s tomb</p><p><br></p><p>was fronted by an immense wooden door, barred and padlocked.</p><p>Nobody could get into it – at least through the door: as his last
joke</p><p>the Mulla decreed that the tomb should have no walls around it.…</p><p>Oh, what the Mulla did with his tomb everybody is doing with his life
– and unknowingly!</p><p>If you also want to do it – at least do it knowingly,</p><p>because I know that knowingly you cannot do it! Not only you cannot,
but no one can do it, because no stupidity can be done with oneself
knowingly.</p><p>197</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>The universe cares for little but play.</p><p><br></p><p>But man in his life does hardly anything but work,</p><p><br></p><p>and because of this everything has become upside down. Hence the
agony.</p><p>The law, the TAO of the universe, is play – leela, and the law of the
human reason is work because reason cannot think beyond utility.</p><p>But existence exists beyond utility.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditate on this gap and you will find the bridge – and the bridge is
necessary</p><p>because you cannot exist without work,</p><p>and to exist only for work is unbearable and unlivable.</p><p>The meditative mall works that he may play – the reason for his work
is play,</p><p>and the unmeditative man plays that he may work – the reason for his
play is work.</p><p>198</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Life does not need comfort when it can be offered meaning nor
pleasure when it can be shown purpose,</p><p>because in the total intensity of intentional living is the fruition
of the seed of consciousness.</p><p>And consciousness without the self is the goal. Consciousness without
the centre –</p><p>and you have reached. Consciousness without ego is nirvana:</p><p>or you may call it God or whatsoever you like. Know that everyone is
seeking this state of being, but unless the seeker is lost this state of
being cannot be found –</p><p>and the seeker can only be lost</p><p><br></p><p>in the fire of total intensity of living.</p><p><br></p><p>So live totally</p><p><br></p><p>and live in the moment</p><p>and moment to moment,</p><p><br></p><p>because there is no other way to live totally,</p><p><br></p><p>and no other way to dissolve the centre, the self, the ego.</p><p>199</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>The secret of meditation is the art of unlearning.

his teachings.</p><p>Almost at once</p><p><br></p><p>one of them detached himself from the group, angered by the erratic
behaviour of the Master.</p><p>On the Master’s instructions</p><p><br></p><p>the second was told by a disciple that the sage was a fraud.</p><p>He withdrew soon afterwards.

fundamental things by sight.</p><p>The second was an illustration of the injunction:</p><p><br></p><p>Do not judge things of deep importance by hearing. The third was an
example of the dictum:</p><p>Never judge by speech or the lack of it.</p><p><br></p><p>When asked by a disciple</p><p><br></p><p>why the applicants could not have been instructed in this matter</p><p>the Master retorted: I am here to give real knowledge,</p><p>not to teach what people pretend</p><p><br></p><p>that they have already learned at their mother’s knees.</p><p>201</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Always remember the golden rule:</p><p><br></p><p>ONE STEP AT A TIME.</p><p><br></p><p>A goodnatured woman was often asked for food by tramps. She finally
decided to refuse them;</p><p>it was becoming too burdensome.</p><p><br></p><p>But shortly after she made her resolution one young man stopped</p><p>and asked her for a little piece of thread.</p><p><br></p><p>She noticed that his pants were badly ripped, that he had a
needle,</p><p>and she realized he could not get work with his pants in their
present condition, so she gave him the thread.</p><p>The fellow took the thread,</p><p><br></p><p>went down the road and sat under a tree for a few minutes, then came
back to the house.</p><p>He told the woman he could not repair the pants unless he had a piece
of cloth for a patch.</p><p>She gave him a small piece of material.</p><p><br></p><p>About an hour later the young fellow came again to the house and
said: Madam, these pants are beyond repair.</p><p>It would be very good of you</p><p><br></p><p>if you could give me a pair of your husband’s old pants.</p><p><br></p><p>So she gave him a pair of old pants and smiled at his cleverness.</p><p>The young man went behind the barn and changed into the pants given
to him.</p><p>Then he returned to the house and told the woman</p><p>that the pants were sort of big around the waist, but if she could
give him some food</p><p>he was sure they would fit perfectly. This time the woman burst out
laughing and gave him a big dinner.</p><p>And all because he took one step at a time. 202</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Knowledge is accumulation,</p><p><br></p><p>that is why knowledge is always dead while learning is moment to

egolessness:</p><p>because the ego cannot exist in the present</p><p><br></p><p>and because awareness cannot exist except in the present. So they
both cannot exist simultaneously.</p><p>Ego is unawareness</p><p><br></p><p>and awareness is egolessness. 204</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>I live not by planning</p><p><br></p><p>and I feel also that this is the only way to be alive at all.</p><p>In fact I live a wild life, absolutely unplanned,</p><p>not knowing anything about the future – not even about the next
moment.</p><p>Today is enough for me – really more than enough!</p><p>The moment that is present is the only living moment – the past is
dead in the sense that it is no more</p><p>and the future is also dead</p><p><br></p><p>in the sense that it is not yet born.</p><p><br></p><p>And so to be concerned with the past is to be dead and to be
concerned with the future is also to be dead. The only way to be alive
is to be here and now –</p><p>in the moment and totally in it.</p><p><br></p><p>Living moment to moment I have found that ecstasy and bliss which is
not of this world at all.</p><p>The single moment lived totally transcends time itself. It becomes
the gap between two moments of time, and if one can be in this gap</p><p>then one is beyond death because time is death and timelessness is
life.</p><p>Life is not something fixed and finished, life is living what is,</p><p>a process, just riverlike,</p><p><br></p><p>flowing always into the unknown,</p><p><br></p><p>from the shores of the known to the shores of the unknown.</p><p>205</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Anger, violence, greed or envy</p><p><br></p><p>cannot be overcome by the cultivation of their opposites, because
anger itself will cultivate its opposite</p><p>and violence will be present in its cultivated non-violence. So
always be aware of the hypnotic spell of the opposite: it never solves
any problem</p><p>because it is beating around the bush. Do not fall into the trap of
the opposite but understand anger, violence or greed or anything else
directly.</p><p>To seek the opposite is a way of escape. To seek the opposite is
cowardice.</p><p>Live with your mind as it is. Do not try to change it.</p><p>Be brave and face it and understand it.</p><p><br></p><p>When the light of awareness falls on anger or greed or envy</p><p>there is change.</p><p>Awareness acts as a catalytic agent –</p><p><br></p><p>and then anger does not change into its opposite, it is not that
violence becomes non-violence,</p><p>but there is no-anger, there is no-violence,</p><p>and when there is no-violence there is no-mind,</p><p><br></p><p>and an altogether different dimension opens its door: the dimension
of the spontaneous,</p><p>the dimension of the divine. 206</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Moment to moment life passes into death, because it is death.</p><p>Covered, it appears as life, uncovered it is death.</p><p>Remember this fact always. This is silent meditation.</p><p>And when this remembering penetrates even in your dreams</p><p>you will have a new door opened unto you. Through it in fact you will
be altogether new. And ultimately reborn.</p><p>Remembering death gives a new dimension to consciousness</p><p>because to remember death is not natural.</p><p><br></p><p>On the contrary nature has arranged that one should not be aware of
it</p><p>because the moment one transcends death one transcends nature
also.</p><p>And one cannot transcend death unless one is totally aware of the
fact. So be totally aware of death.</p><p>And it is happening each moment within and without. It is present
everywhere.</p><p>And because it is so obvious one becomes absent to it.</p><p>Remember – and deepen the consciousness, because as the awareness of
death goes deeper one becomes capable of feeling that which is
deathless.</p><p>Really, death is the door – the opening to the deathless. But be
conscious of it.</p><p>Be conscious and transcend.</p><p><br></p><p>Be conscious and know that which is before birth and after death.</p><p>And – you are that.</p><p><br></p><p>207</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Be a stranger to yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>See life as a river flowing through time.</p><p><br></p><p>Stand on the bank, neither curious nor concerned. Glance or gaze at
the driftwood of your past floating in memory –</p><p>just like the incidents one reads about in the paper. Detached and
indifferent remember that nothing matters. ONLY EXIST –</p><p>and the explosion.</p><p><br></p><p>208</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Be always positive, in each and every situation – that helps
meditative awareness very much.</p><p>Negative attitudes negate the whole effort.</p><p><br></p><p>Diogenes was looking for an honest man in New Delhi. What luck? asked
the wayfarer.</p><p>Oh, pretty fair, sir, replied Diogenes. I still have my lantern.</p><p>209</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Philosophy cannot cure you of questions – on the contrary, it can
give you more.</p><p>This I have heard at a chemist’s shop:</p><p>Did the patent medicine you purchased cure your aunt?</p><p>Mercy, no.</p><p><br></p><p>On reading the circular that was wrapped around the bottle she got
two more diseases.</p><p>210</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla Nasrudin was carrying home some liver which he had just
bought.</p><p>In the other hand he held a recipe for liver pie which a friend had
given him.</p><p>Suddenly a buzzard swooped down and carried off the liver. You fool!
shouted Nasrudin.</p><p>Having the meat is all very well,</p><p><br></p><p>but what will you do without the recipe? 211</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Man can only know what God is not.</p><p><br></p><p>To know what God is, is impossible because there begins the realm of
being. You cannot know God but you can BE, and in that dimension is the
only knowing; but that knowing</p><p>is altogether different from all our other knowings</p><p>because in that knowing there is no knower and no known,</p><p>but only knowing.</p><p><br></p><p>That is why in that dimension knowing and being are the same.</p><p>There is no knowledge even</p><p><br></p><p>because knowledge is dead and therefore a thing. Moreover, knowledge
is always of the past,</p><p>and God is never in the past nor in the future.</p><p>God is now, always now; and here,</p><p>and always here.</p><p><br></p><p>Close your eyes and see. Then open your eyes and see.</p><p>Then neither close your eyes nor open your eyes and see. 212</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>There was once a man</p><p><br></p><p>who was obsessed with the idea</p><p><br></p><p>that there was a secret knower in those who achieved success.</p><p>To discover this secret</p><p>he devoted years to study and research:</p><p><br></p><p>ancient masonry, philosophy, astrology, psychology, salesmanship,
religious beliefs,</p><p>the various cults that have had their rise and fall –</p><p>all these he studied long and diligently, but no conclusion was
visible.</p><p>He struggled and struggled but still there was no conclusion.</p><p><br></p><p>And then instead of success in his search for the secret of success
came death – and as death approached him</p><p>he realized the goal of his whole life’s efforts, and finally he gave
his conclusion to those who were near him.</p><p>It came in two short words: I WILL. 213</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Do not believe in thinking because that is the greatest of all
superstitions –</p><p>but well hidden</p><p><br></p><p>because it pretends to be anti-superstitious! Thinking is nothing but
dust in a blind mind because you cannot think that which is not known –
and you need not think that which is already known.</p><p>The encounter is always with the unknown. The unknown is
everywhere,</p><p>within and without,</p><p><br></p><p>and thinking is always in the known and of the known.</p><p><br></p><p>You call never be in contact with the unknown through the known so
throw the known and be in contact with the unknown.</p><p>And this is what I call meditation. 214</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Man goes on dreaming and desiring but basically remains where he is.
and in the end</p><p>nothing but ashes of his dreams and desires are in his hands –</p><p>and of course tears in his eyes. Panchatantra has a beautiful
story:</p><p>In a certain town lived a Brahmin named Seedy who got some barley
meal by begging,</p><p>ate a portion,</p><p><br></p><p>and filled a jar with the remainder. This jar he hung on a peg one
night, placed his cot beneath it</p><p>and fixing his gaze on the jar fell into a hypnotic reverie.</p><p>Well here is a jar of barley meal, he thought.</p><p><br></p><p>Now if famine comes</p><p><br></p><p>a hundred rupees will come out of it. With that sum I will get two
she-goats.</p><p>Every six months they will bear two more she-goats. After goats,
cows.</p><p>When the cows calve I will sell the calves. After cows, buffalos.</p><p>After buffalos, mares.</p><p><br></p><p>From the mares I shall get plenty of horses. The sale of these will
mean plenty of gold.</p><p>The gold will buy a great house with an inner court.</p><p><br></p><p>Then someone will come to my house and offer his lovely daughter with
a dowry.</p><p>She will bear a son whom I shall call Moonlord. When he is old enough
to ride on my knee I will take a book,</p><p>sit on the stable roof and think. Just then Moonlord will see me,</p><p>will jump from his mother’s lap in his eagerness to ride on my
knee</p><p>and will go too near the horses.</p><p><br></p><p>Then I shall get angry and tell my wife to take the boy but she will
be too busy with her chores</p><p>and will not pay attention to what I say. Then I will get up and kick
her!</p><p>Being sunk in his hypnotic dream</p><p><br></p><p>he let fly such a kick that he smashed the jar</p><p><br></p><p>and the barley meal it contained turned him white all over.</p><p>215</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Go on discarding: not this, not this (NETI, NETI). and ultimately
when nothing remains to be discarded –</p><p>then is the explosion.</p><p><br></p><p>Do not cling to anything, to any thought. Go on and on until the
nothingness.</p><p>I have heard about a little boy Toyo and his meditations.</p><p><br></p><p>He was only twelve years old</p><p><br></p><p>but he wanted to be given something to ponder, to meditate on,</p><p>so one evening he went to Mokurai, the Zen master, struck the gong
softly to announce his presence, and sat before the master in respectful
silence.</p><p>Finally the master said: Toyo, show me the sound of two hands.</p><p>Toyo clapped his hands.</p><p>Good, said the master.</p><p><br></p><p>Now show me the sound of one hand clapping. Toyo was silent.</p><p>Finally he bowed and left to meditate on the problem.</p><p>The next night he returned and struck the gong with one palm.</p><p>That is not right, said the master.</p><p><br></p><p>The next night Toyo returned and played geisha music with one
hand.</p><p>That is not right, said the master.</p><p><br></p><p>And again and again Toyo returned with some answer but the master
said again and again, That is not</p><p>right.</p><p><br></p><p>For nights Toyo tried new sounds</p><p><br></p><p>but each and every answer was rejected.</p><p><br></p><p>The question itself was absurd so no answer could be right.</p><p><br></p><p>And when on the eleventh night Toyo came and before he spoke anything
the master said: That is still not right!</p><p>– then he stopped coming to the master.</p><p><br></p><p>For a year he thought of every possible sound and discarded them
all,</p><p>and when there was nothing left to be discarded any more</p><p>he exploded into enlightenment.</p><p><br></p><p>When he was no more he returned to the master</p><p><br></p><p>and without striking the gong he sat down and bowed.</p><p><br></p><p>He was not saying anything and there was silence.</p><p>Then the master said: So you have heard the sound without sound!</p><p>216</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Thought is divisive,</p><p><br></p><p>it divides ad infinitum,</p><p><br></p><p>so thought can never come to the total, to the whole.</p><p>and the whole is while the parts are not – or they are only for the
mind:</p><p>and if there is no mind then there are no parts.</p><p><br></p><p>With the mind and because of the mind the one becomes many – or
appears so; and with the mind and through the mind, to conceive the one
is impossible.</p><p>Of course it can think about the one,</p><p><br></p><p>but that one is nothing but a putting together of all the parts,</p><p>and that one is quite different from the one which is.</p><p>The one which is conceptualized by the mind is just a mathematical
construct:</p><p>it is not a living whole, it is not organic,</p><p>and unless one experiences the cosmos as an organic whole one has not
known anything at all.</p><p>This is not possible with thought, but this is possible with
no-thought. 217</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>EMPTINESS IS ALL –</p><p><br></p><p>and to get hold of emptiness is to get all and be all. But it is very
arduous to get hold of emptiness – because it is emptiness! And it hurts
much – though it is emptiness, still it hurts much!</p><p>Because to make way for it the ego has to die.</p><p><br></p><p>But I am happy that you are dying</p><p><br></p><p>because this is the only way to be beyond death – I say: the only
way.</p><p>Remember this always.</p><p><br></p><p>Sekkyo said once to one of his monks: Can you get hold of emptiness
–</p><p>I will try, said the monk; and he cupped his hands in the air.</p><p>That is absurd, said Sekkyo.</p><p><br></p><p>You have not got anything in there.</p><p><br></p><p>Well, Master, said the monk, please show me the right way.</p><p>Thereupon Sekkyo seized the monk’s nose and gave it a great yank.</p><p>Ouch! yelled the monk. You hurt me!</p><p><br></p><p>I cannot help it</p><p><br></p><p>because that is the only way to get hold of emptiness!</p><p>said Sekkyo. 218</p><p>Man asks questions and then answers them himself. Nothing is answered
in this way.</p><p>But man is capable of deceiving himself – and the whole of
philosophy</p><p>is nothing but such a deception. Man asks: What is mind?</p><p>and then answers himself: Not matter? nd then asks: What is
matter?</p><p>and then answers: Not mind? and this stupid game goes on.</p><p>I have heard about a distinguished philosopher</p><p><br></p><p>who customarily began his speeches with: Why are we here?</p><p>He had occasion to address the inmates of a mental hospital and
finally said: Ladies and Gentlemen, why are we here?</p><p>One of the inmates called out:</p><p><br></p><p>We are all here because we are not all there! 219</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>The mind always thinks in terms of the self. It is egocentric.</p><p>During the French revolution</p><p><br></p><p>a man from Paris stopped at a village</p><p><br></p><p>and was asked by a friend what was happening.</p><p><br></p><p>They are cutting off heads by thousands, said the visitor. How
terrible! cried the villager.</p><p>That could ruin my hat business! But this is the way of the mind,</p><p>and because of this it is never in tune with the cosmos, so how can
it know life?</p><p>It cannot know it because it cannot be one with it.</p><p><br></p><p>Really with the mind there is no knowing but only superficial
acquaintance.</p><p>Intimate and deep knowing comes only with no-mind –</p><p>and meditation is dissolving mind into no-mind. 220</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>A monk asked Hyakujo Yekai:</p><p><br></p><p>What is the most miraculous event in the world? Hyakujo said: I sit
here all by myself!</p><p>221</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Freedom from becoming means freedom for being. Becoming is
desiring,</p><p>being is that which is.</p><p><br></p><p>Becoming is longing for the future, being is to be in the
present.</p><p>Becoming is mental, being is existential.</p><p>That is why becoming must cease for the being to reveal itself.</p><p>Becoming is just like the smoke around the flame, or just like the
outer covering around the seed,</p><p>so please let the smoke go</p><p><br></p><p>for the flame to explode in its complete glory and splendour, and let
the seed die to its outer shell</p><p>so that it may be what it is in its innermost depth.</p><p>222</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p>No more principles are needed.</p><p><br></p><p>The world is already much too burdened with principles</p><p>and persons who are men of principles.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard that once a priest was consoling a widow.</p><p><br></p><p>He said feelingly about her dead husband that he was a man of
principle.</p><p>That he was, sighed the widow.</p><p><br></p><p>Every Saturday night for these twenty years the poor man would come
home</p><p>and faithfully hand me his pay envelope – that he never missed
doing.</p><p>Of course the envelope was always empty, but mind you,</p><p>he was loyal to the principle of the thing. 223</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Religion is – living without conflict, that is – without ideas</p><p>and without ideals,</p><p><br></p><p>because whenever one lives with ideals there is conflict,</p><p>there is conflict between</p><p><br></p><p>that which is and that which should be,</p><p>and then life is misery. See this and go beyond.</p><p>In fact the very seeing of the fact is going beyond. And please do
not ask the seemingly inevitable how? because there is no HOW to it.</p><p>Either you see it or you do not see it –</p><p><br></p><p>and moreover the how is again the creator of conflict.</p><p>224</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Bhakti needs only time to absorb the shock she has come across</p><p>in her deep meditations;</p><p><br></p><p>remember – only time and nothing else. The shock is nothing new.</p><p>It happens whenever the deeper layers of the unconscious are
encountered</p><p>Before any mutation this is absolutely necessary.</p><p><br></p><p>Be grateful to the divine because this is a good omen.</p><p><br></p><p>Bhakti needed it badly</p><p><br></p><p>and when she is out of it she will be a new person totally. Soon she
will be twice-born.</p><p>At present she is passing through a great spiritual crisis, so you be
with her – but just as if you are not.</p><p>Be present, but with absolute absence.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the only way you can be helpful to her. Let her be alone as
much as possible.</p><p>Do not talk with her except where it is needed absolutely –</p><p>and then too be telegraphic.</p><p><br></p><p>But if she herself wants to talk let her talk as much as she
likes,</p><p>and you yourself be just a passive listener.</p><p><br></p><p>Let her do whatsoever she wants to do or not do and soon everything
will be okay.</p><p>Do not worry at all.</p><p><br></p><p>I will be there beside you always –</p><p><br></p><p>and if you can see, you will be able to see me also.</p><p><br></p><p>Of course Bhakti will feel my presence</p><p><br></p><p>and become aware of me these days so many times. Convey my blessings
to her.</p><p>225</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>One day a man came to the Sufi teacher Bahaudin.</p><p><br></p><p>He asked for help in his problems and guidance on the path.</p><p>Bahaudin told him to abandon spiritual studies and to leave his court
at once.</p><p>A kind-hearted visitor began to remonstrate with Bahaudin.</p><p>You shall have a demonstration, said the Master.</p><p><br></p><p>At that moment a bird flew into the room darting hither and
thither</p><p>not knowing where to go in order to escape.</p><p><br></p><p>The Master waited</p><p><br></p><p>until the bird settled near the only open window</p><p><br></p><p>of the chamber and then suddenly clapped his hands. Alarmed,</p><p>the bird flew straight through the opening of the window to
freedom.</p><p>To him that sound must have been something of a shock, even an
affront, do you not agree? said Bahaudin.</p><p>226</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Fu Ta Shih says:</p><p><br></p><p>Each night one embraces a Buddha while sleeping Each morning one gets
up again with him</p><p>Rising or sitting –</p><p><br></p><p>both watch and follow one another Speaking or not speaking –</p><p>both are in the same place</p><p><br></p><p>They never part even for a moment</p><p>but are like the body and its shadow.</p><p><br></p><p>If you wish to know the Buddha’s whereabouts, in the sound of your
own voice –</p><p>there he is.</p><p><br></p><p>Do you understand this?</p><p><br></p><p>If not now – when will you understand?</p><p><br></p><p>And this is not being asked for the first time, but many many times
in many many lives the same question has been raised –</p><p>and you have not yet answered! Now, is it not time enough?</p><p>227</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Mind is localization of consciousness,</p><p><br></p><p>and it can be localized in any part of the body.</p><p><br></p><p>Ordinarily we have localized it in the head</p><p><br></p><p>but other cultures and other civilizations in the past have tried
other parts of the body also,</p><p>and on other planets</p><p><br></p><p>there are beings with other parts of their bodies working as their
minds,</p><p>but whatsoever may be the part chosen localization of consciousness
means its freezing, and whenever it ceases to flow freely as is
needed</p><p>it is no more consciousness in its suchness. Meditation means:
consciousness in its suchness, so let consciousness fill the whole
body,</p><p>let it flow throughout the totality of your being and you will have a
feeling of aliveness which is never known and felt by localized
consciousness.</p><p>Whenever there is localization of consciousness the part in which the
localization happens becomes tense and diseased</p><p>and the remainder of the body becomes a dead weight.</p><p><br></p><p>But with meditative consciousness or flowing consciousness everything
changes completely:</p><p>the whole body becomes alive, sensitive and aware and consequently
weightless.</p><p>Then there is no centre for tensions to exist and accumulate because
they cannot exist without frozen blocks of consciousness.</p><p>The flowing, the moving, consciousness</p><p><br></p><p>washes them out constantly with every movement, and when the whole
body is alive</p><p>only then you begin to feel the cosmic consciousness all around
you.</p><p>How can a frozen consciousness,</p><p><br></p><p>and that too surrounded by a dead body,</p><p>feel the cosmic?</p><p><br></p><p>228</p><p><br></p><p>Now man knows more about man than ever and yet no problem is
solved.</p><p>It seems that something is basically wrong with our so-called
knowledge itself.</p><p>This whole knowledge is derived from analysis and analysis is
incapable of penetrating</p><p>into the depths of consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>The analytical method is all right with matter or with things because
there is no inside to them,</p><p>but consciousness is insideness,</p><p><br></p><p>and to use the analytical method with consciousness is to treat it as
an object</p><p>while it is not an object at all. And it cannot be made an object;
its very nature is subjectivity,</p><p>its being is subjectivity,</p><p><br></p><p>so it must not be approached from outside</p><p><br></p><p>because then whatsoever is known about it is not about it.
Consciousness must be approached from inside –</p><p>and then the method is meditation and not analysis. Meditation is
synthetic:</p><p>it is concerned with the whole and not with the parts</p><p>it is subjective and not objective,</p><p><br></p><p>it is irrational or super-rational and not rational, it is religious
or mystic and not scientific.</p><p>Authentic knowledge of consciousness</p><p><br></p><p>comes only through meditation and all else is just superficial
acquaintance and basically erroneous</p><p>because the very source of it is fallacious and poisonous. 229</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Life is a dream so enjoy it;</p><p><br></p><p>but do not ask for more because then you only disturb the dream</p><p>and get nothing except a disturbed night.</p><p><br></p><p>Be a witness to the dreaming mind and then there is
transcendence:</p><p>then you go beyond dreaming and beyond mind itself.</p><p><br></p><p>And know well that there is an awakening BELOW the dreaming mind
which is nothing but just a disturbed dream.</p><p>One can get to this below-dreaming state of awakening through asking
for more desiring more –</p><p>as ordinarily we all do.</p><p><br></p><p>In a dream Mulla Nasrudin saw himself being counted out coins and
when there were nine silver pieces in his hand</p><p>the invisible donor stopped giving them.</p><p>Nasrudin shouted: I MUST HAVE TEN! So loudly that he woke himself
up.</p><p>Finding that all the money had disappeared he closed his eyes again
and murmured, All right then give them back –</p><p>I will take the nine.</p><p><br></p><p>There is also an awakening above the dreaming mind – the real
awakening</p><p>in comparison to which man ordinarily is asleep.</p><p><br></p><p>One can get to this awakening</p><p><br></p><p>through witnessing the dreaming mind –</p><p><br></p><p>and unless one gets to it one is not really alive. 230</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>The divine is that from which one cannot depart, and that from which
one can depart is not the divine.</p><p>So find that from which you have never departed and cannot ever
depart from –</p><p>and then laugh at the absurdity of the human mind and its
efforts!</p><p>Buddha is still laughing because of that Listen!</p><p>231</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Why does man suffer?</p><p><br></p><p>Man suffers because of his craving,</p><p><br></p><p>craving to possess that which cannot be possessed, and craving to
keep things for ever with himself which are essentially impermanent.</p><p>And chief among these things is his own ego, his own persona.</p><p>But all things are impermanent. Except for change itself. everything
changes.</p><p>Really nothing is</p><p><br></p><p>because everything is only a process,</p><p><br></p><p>so as soon as one tries to possess anything it slips away.</p><p>The possessor himself is slipping away constantly! Then there is
frustration.</p><p>and then there is suffering. Know this well,</p><p>realize this well and there will be no suffering because then you
have uprooted the root.</p><p>232</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>The self can never be free –</p><p>because the self itself is the bondage.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the meaning of the penetrating saying of Jesus:</p><p><br></p><p>He that saveth his life shall lose it</p><p><br></p><p>and he that loseth his life shall keep it unto life eternal. Or that
of Lao Tzu in TAO-TE-KING:</p><p>He who humbles himself shall be saved, he who bends shall be made
straight</p><p>and he who empties himself shall be filled. One is not to make the
self free;</p><p>rather on the contrary, ONE HAS TO BE FREE FROM THE SELF. The self is
nothing but the husk of the seed.</p><p>Do not cling to it.</p><p><br></p><p>Sings Wu Ming Fu:</p><p><br></p><p>The seed that has to grow must lose itself as seed,</p><p><br></p><p>and they that creep may graduate through chrysalis to wings.</p><p><br></p><p>Wilt thou then, O mortal, cling to husks which falsely seem to you
the self?</p><p>233</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>The gates of the temple are wide open and it is only after thousands
of years that such opportunity comes to this earth.</p><p>Know well that they will not remain open for ever, the opportunity
can be lost very easily,</p><p>and you are still wavering, and you are still hesitating – to enter
or not to enter –</p><p>to be or not to be.</p><p><br></p><p>I know that the challenge is great, but I know also that your being
is completely ready to take the jump. Hence my insistent call for you to
come and enter.</p><p>And this is not for the first time that I have called you. nor the
first life;</p><p>I know you Bhakti, through so many births! And soon you will also
remember many things. But not before the jump.</p><p>Only your superficial persona is resisting, not you –</p><p>and it is expected to resist always</p><p><br></p><p>because the moment one take the plunge into the unknown</p><p>it has to die naturally.</p><p><br></p><p>So please do not identify yourself with it;</p><p><br></p><p>be a witness to it, and you will be in the jump. Oh, it is time
enough now to die to the old ego and be reborn to the supreme self!</p><p>234</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p>Logic is not all; neither is consistency;</p><p>because even madness has its own methods, rationalizations and inner
consistencies.</p><p>A madman was throwing handfuls of crumbs around his house. What are
you doing? someone asked him.</p><p>Keeping the elephants away, he answered.</p><p><br></p><p>But there are no elephants in these parts, said the enquirer.</p><p>That is right.</p><p><br></p><p>My method is effective isn’t it? declared the madman. 235</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Total acceptance of existence is impossible for the mind because the
mind exists as denial.</p><p>It exists with the NO.</p><p><br></p><p>and with a total YES it dies.</p><p><br></p><p>So it continues to find reasons to say no even if there are no
reasons.</p><p>Walking with a disciple one day</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla Nasrudin saw for the first time in his life a beautiful
lakeland scene.</p><p>What a delight! he exclaimed. But if only, if only... If only what,
Master? asked the disciple.</p><p>If only they had not put water into it! said the Mulla. 236</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation is like the sea:</p><p><br></p><p>receiving the dirty river and yet remaining pure. You need not be
purified before it,</p><p>but you will come purified out of it. Meditation is
unconditional,</p><p>purity is not a prerequirement but a consequence. 237</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Be like a dead one,</p><p><br></p><p>and then dualisms will not contaminate you</p><p><br></p><p>and you will reach the state of non-arising of thought, the
brightness of self-nature will appear in full –</p><p>and when this happens you are no more.</p><p><br></p><p>This disappearance is the appearance of the divine, so please –
DISAPPEAR!</p><p>238</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Existence exists in order to exist – And likewise life.</p><p>There is no meaning to it beyond itself so never posit any
meaning</p><p>otherwise you will feel its meaninglessness. It is not meaningless
and it cannot be so because there is no meaning in it all!</p><p>The very search for meaning is mean and ugly because it comes from
the utilitarian mind of man.</p><p>Existence simply is and likewise life:</p><p>there is no purpose in it and there is no end to it. Oh, feel it here
and now!</p><p>Please do not practise it</p><p><br></p><p>because that is the way of the utilitarian mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Be playful</p><p><br></p><p>and only then will you know the playfulness of the universe.</p><p>And to know that is to be religious. 239</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Do not continue circling in the old rut – and the way out is just by
your hand. The mind is the past, the dead past;</p><p>one has to break it somewhere and jump out of it The mind is the
prison, the slavery.</p><p>Be free of it.</p><p>And the moment is ripe.</p><p><br></p><p>Of course I know that you are still not clearly aware of it but you
are not unaware either.</p><p>Gather courage and jump into the unknown.</p><p><br></p><p>One step only is enough</p><p><br></p><p>because the next follows it automatically.</p><p><br></p><p>But do not go on thinking and thinking and thinking.</p><p><br></p><p>Thinking promises to lead you somewhere but the promise remains
always a promise</p><p>because thinking is just impotent as far as life is concerned. So
please, be existential.</p><p>Do not hesitate.</p><p><br></p><p>And You have nothing to lose – because you have nothing!</p><p>Realize this and be nothing – no-one. 240</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Life is movement, process,</p><p>fluidity;</p><p><br></p><p>but ideas become fixed,</p><p><br></p><p>so they become also anti-life. They become dead blocks.</p><p>Do not remain with them.</p><p>MOVE.</p><p><br></p><p>And do not fear inconsistency because life is not a syllogism, life
is not a theory</p><p>but a mystery.</p><p><br></p><p>Someone asked Mulla Nasrudin: How old are you, Mulla? Forty.</p><p>But you said the same last time I asked you, five years ago!</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, I am always consistent and always stand by what I have said.
241</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Mind means consciousness somewhere – centred,</p><p>focussed and tense.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation means consciousness nowhere, and when it is nowhere it is
everywhere – decentralized.</p><p>unfocussed and non-tense.</p><p>Mind is agony by its very nature, meditation – ecstasy.</p><p>Do not treat consciousness like a cat tied to a string. This very
treatment –</p><p>or mistreatment –</p><p>creates the mind</p><p><br></p><p>The consciousness must be left to itself. utterly free to move</p><p>and be,</p><p><br></p><p>according to its nature. Do not localize it.</p><p>Do not partialize it.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the essence of my discipline of no-discipline.</p><p>Preserve the absolute fluidity of your consciousness and then you
will not he.</p><p>and when you are not and only consciousness is then for the first
time the doors of the divine are open to you.</p><p>242</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, man learns by experience!</p><p><br></p><p>Two old drunkards</p><p><br></p><p>were in the habit of coming together twice a week to the wineseller
to get drunk.</p><p>After years of this one of them died. His old friend came in on the
Saturday and they told him his pal had died –</p><p>that the whisky had been taken into blood circulation</p><p>and so saturated his blood and his breath that one night before going
to bed</p><p>the old man went to blow out the candle</p><p><br></p><p>and his breath caught fire and he was burned to death.</p><p><br></p><p>The other man promptly called for a bible and took all oath that from
that time forward</p><p>he would never blow out another candle in his life! Yes, man learns
by experience!</p><p>243</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Do not imitate anyone, do not follow anyone,</p><p>otherwise you will be just a pseudo existence – and that is worse
than suicide.</p><p>BE YOURSELF –</p><p><br></p><p>and only then can you be responsible and authentic</p><p>and real.</p><p><br></p><p>But ordinarily everyone is just secondhand and borrowed,</p><p>and that makes everything ugly.</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla Nasrudin went to a mosque and sat down.</p><p><br></p><p>His shirt was rather short</p><p><br></p><p>and the man behind him pulled it lower,</p><p>thinking it looked unseemly.</p><p><br></p><p>Nasrudin immediately pulled the shirt of the man in front of him.
What are you doing? asked the man in front.</p><p>Don’t ask me. Ask the man behind – he started it, said Nasrudin.</p><p>244</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>The real religious experience</p><p><br></p><p>cannot be organized, taught or transmitted. To systematize it is to
kill it.</p><p>It is so living and moving and dynamic</p><p><br></p><p>that to impose a pattern on it is impossible;</p><p><br></p><p>and the experience is always so unique and individual that it cannot
be put into any category –</p><p>although it happens when the individual is not! It cannot be
followed,</p><p>for everyone has to find it for himself, and that is the beauty of
it,</p><p>and also its freedom and virginity.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not new in the sense of any opposition to the old, it is new in
the sense of timelessness –</p><p>that is, with eternal freshness and innocence – as every flower is
new</p><p>and every sunrise is new</p><p>and every love is new.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not borrowed from the past, it is not based on any tradition.
it is not derived from without,</p><p>it happens within without any causality.</p><p>It happens unconditionally.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not continuous with the mind, it is a discontinuous
explosion.</p><p>There are clouds in the sky and the sky cannot be seen, but there is
no causal chain.</p><p>The clouds have gone and the sky is clear</p><p>but there is no cause-and-effect relationship. The sky has not even
known the clouds!</p><p>It has not been affected by them in any way whatsoever.</p><p>245</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Life becomes more authentic</p><p><br></p><p>in the encountering of death directly.</p><p><br></p><p>But we always try to escape the fact of death, and thereby life
becomes pseudo and phoney.</p><p>Even death when authentic has a beauty of its own while pseudo-life
is just ugly.</p><p>Meditate on death</p><p><br></p><p>because there is no way to know life unless you stand face to face
with death – and it is everywhere;</p><p>wherever life is death is also;</p><p><br></p><p>they are really two aspects of one and the same phenomenon, and when
one comes to know this, he transcends both.</p><p>Only in that transcendence is the total flowering of
consciousness</p><p>and the ecstasy of being. 246</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Man adds everything to his ego – while everything goes on without
him. He is nothing,</p><p>but he thinks himself everything.</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla Nasrudin was walking past a well when he had the impulse to
look into it. It was night,</p><p>and as he peered into the deep water he saw the moon’s reflection
there.</p><p>I must save the moon! the Mulla thought.</p><p>Otherwise she will never wane and the fasting month of Ramadan will
never come to an end.</p><p>He found a rope, threw it in and called down: Hold tight! Keep
bright, succour is at hand! The rope caught in a rock inside the well
and Nasrudin heaved as hard as he could.</p><p>Straining back he suddenly felt the rope give way as it became loose
and he was thrown on his back.</p><p>As he lay there panting</p><p><br></p><p>he saw the moon riding on the sky above. Glad to be of service, said
Nasrudin.</p><p>Just as well I came along, wasn’t it? 247</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Are you really aware of what anger is?</p><p><br></p><p>Are you really aware of it when it is present?</p><p><br></p><p>I ask these questions</p><p><br></p><p>because man is never present in the present.</p><p><br></p><p>Man lives in the past</p><p><br></p><p>and only becomes aware of anything when it has become a part of
memory.</p><p>One becomes aware of anger and sadness only when they are all
over,</p><p>and then awareness is just pseudo-awareness; it is not awareness but
remembering</p><p>and remembering leads nowhere because it is running in a circle. Then
one can fight with anger but can never understand it,</p><p>and fighting with anger is anger – of course more subtle</p><p>and therefore more strong and more poisonous.</p><p><br></p><p>So do not think about anger or sadness or happiness</p><p><br></p><p>and do not misunderstand remembering them as an awareness but be
aware when anger is present.</p><p>Be totally conscious of it,</p><p><br></p><p>live it consciously and do not escape from it and then you will know
what it is.</p><p>To understand it is to transcend it.</p><p><br></p><p>Then you will find a silence descending on you which passes all
understanding.</p><p>248</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Never to have seen the truth is better than to have seen it and not
to have acted upon it. 249</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>One should never be afraid of rising thoughts or desires but only of
the delay in being aware of them.</p><p>250</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>The purest ore is produced from the hottest furnace;</p><p><br></p><p>and the brook would lose its song if we removed the rocks. 251</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Be empty and you will know.</p><p><br></p><p>Be empty and you will be the mirror.</p><p><br></p><p>Oh, only total nothingess is capable fo knowing all!</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard that the nun Chiyono studied for years</p><p><br></p><p>and meditated for years on the ultimate questions of existence but
was unable to find the light.</p><p>The thinking was filling her so much</p><p><br></p><p>that she could not be a passage to the divine.</p><p><br></p><p>She was so much filled by herself</p><p><br></p><p>that she could not be a host to the divine guest, and the more she
longed for enlightenment</p><p>the more far off it was.</p><p><br></p><p>But one moonlit night she was carrying an old pail filled with
water</p><p>– and the thing happened!</p><p>She was watching the full moon reflected in her pail water when the
bamboo drip that held the pail staves broke.</p><p>The pail fell all apart, the water rushed out,</p><p>the moon’s reflection disappeared – and with it disappeared Chiyono
herself.</p><p>She was not – but the enlightenment was there! She wrote this
verse:</p><p>This way and that way</p><p><br></p><p>I tried to keep the pail together hoping the weak bamboo would never
break.</p><p>But suddenly the bottom fell out:</p><p><br></p><p>no more water</p><p><br></p><p>no more moon in the water – and emptiness in my hand! 252</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>One day Lin-chi was asked: What is the essence of meditation?</p><p><br></p><p>Lin-chi came right down from his seat</p><p><br></p><p>and taking hold of the questioner by the front of his robe, slapped
his face, then let him go.</p><p>The questioner, of course, stood there stupefied.</p><p><br></p><p>Then Lin-chi laughed and said to him: Why don’t you bow?</p><p>This woke him from his reverie,</p><p><br></p><p>and when he was about to make a bow to the Master he had his first
taste of meditation!</p><p>Please read this again and again and again, and if you do not have
the same taste</p><p>then slap your face yourself</p><p><br></p><p>then laugh and bow down to yourself –</p><p><br></p><p>and then you will have the same taste, surely! 253</p><p>The sun is rising high in the sky.</p><p><br></p><p>Its light enters the house through an opening.</p><p><br></p><p>The dust is seen moving in the ray of light</p><p><br></p><p>but the empty space of the room is unmoving. Now close your eyes and
be silent.</p><p>Then ask yourself: Who am I –</p><p><br></p><p>the moving dust or the unmoving space of the room? Do not answer
intellectually,</p><p>because intellectual answers are not answers, but wait and
realize.</p><p>Hsu Yun says: The mind is nothing but the foreign dust. Who are you –
the mind? – the foreign dust? or – ?</p><p>254</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>The mind is, to raise questions,</p><p>but only questions, it never answers,</p><p>and it can never answer – that is beyond it,</p><p>it is not meant for that, that is not its function. But it TRIES to
answer,</p><p>and the result is the mess called philosophy! Meditation never
questions,</p><p>but it answers. It is the answer,</p><p>because it is life, because it is existence.</p><p>Question – and there is no answer.</p><p><br></p><p>Do not question – and you are the answer. Why is it so?</p><p>It is so because the questioning consciousness, mind,</p><p>is disturbed,</p><p><br></p><p>and the non-questioning consciousness, no mind, is silent, quiet and
at rest in its suchness.</p><p>Philosophy comes out of questioning,</p><p><br></p><p>religion out of the non-questioning consciousness. Logic is the
method of philosophy</p><p>and meditation the method of religion. 255</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>If the present is just continuous with the past then it is not
present at all.</p><p>To be present,</p><p><br></p><p>the present must be discontinuous with the past, only then is it
young, fresh and new –</p><p>and then it is not a part of time but is eternity itself.</p><p>The now is eternal</p><p><br></p><p>but we live in the past or in the future –</p><p><br></p><p>which is nothing but a faint echo of the past itself. our whole
activity springs from the past</p><p>or for the future –</p><p><br></p><p>which is the same thing.</p><p><br></p><p>Then the present is false and dead:</p><p><br></p><p>and if the present is false then we cannot be real, and if the
present is dead then we cannot be alive.</p><p>That is why I insist on living in the present and dying each moment
to the past.</p><p>Live atomically – moment to moment,</p><p><br></p><p>and then your life will have a totally different quality – the
quality of the divine.</p><p>256</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>To me meditation means:</p><p><br></p><p>be playful and transcend all seriousness. See: life is not
serious.</p><p>Look around: existence is not serious.</p><p><br></p><p>Only disease is serious, and of course death, and the exploiters of
death: the priests!</p><p>Life is playful and festive and therefore purposeless.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not going anywhere, because there is nowhere to go. It is
always here and here.</p><p>It is always now and now.</p><p><br></p><p>It is just abundant energy overflowing from here to here and from now
to now,</p><p>and once you know it and be it</p><p><br></p><p>you are in that ecstasy which is the purpose of purposelessness!</p><p>Don’t be a mind and you will know it and be it. Meditation is
nomindedness.</p><p>Mind is thinking, and thinking is going astray from the being. Mind
is forgetfulness of ‘that which is’.</p><p>Meditation is coming back home. So, come back home.</p><p>And I create situations so that you may remember the forgotten,</p><p>and I will go on creating situations until you are back. 257</p><p>There are things which cannot be proved, and there is no evidence for
them because they are self-evident,</p><p>and to try to prove them is ridiculous,</p><p><br></p><p>and the effort shows that one is not acquainted with them. Such are
all the proofs of God.</p><p>Sitting one day in the teahouse</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla Nasrudin heard the rhetoric of a travelling scholar. He was
arguing for the existence of God;</p><p>questioned by one of the company on some point the scholar drew a
book from his pocket</p><p>and banged it on the table:</p><p><br></p><p>This is my evidence! AND I wrote it myself!</p><p><br></p><p>A man who could not only read but write was a rarity, and a man who
had written a book...!</p><p>The villagers treated the pundit with profound respect – and of
course Mulla Nasrudin was impressed!</p><p>Some days later Mulla appeared at the teahouse and asked whether
anyone wanted to buy a house. Tell us something about it.</p><p>Mulla, the people asked him.</p><p><br></p><p>for we did not even know that you had a house of your own</p><p>Actions speak louder than words! shouted Mulla, and from his pocket
he took a brick</p><p>and hurled it on the table in front of them. This is my evidence!
Examine it for quality – and I built the house myself!</p><p>258</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>When you are with me be completely at ease and relaxed; that is, be
totally yourself.</p><p>If you feel like crying, then cry;</p><p><br></p><p>if you feel like weeping, then weep; but just be uninterruptedly
aware.</p><p>Do not think about what you are doing – just be the doing,</p><p>and when your senses are shaken like leaves in the wind – then enter
this shaking,</p><p>because only in such situations the being is revealed.</p><p><br></p><p>If a mood against someone or for someone arises do not place it on
the person in question</p><p>but remain centred in yourself</p><p><br></p><p>and you will know a transcendence which is not of this world at
all.</p><p>259</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p>The past is not nor the future is,</p><p>but the mind exists between these two non-existences,</p><p>and therefore – the misery.</p><p><br></p><p>To live in the mind is to live in misery. In agony and in hell.</p><p>The mind is the hell.</p><p><br></p><p>Be aware suddenly of this</p><p><br></p><p>and then there is a new opening:</p><p><br></p><p>the opening of the present, the opening of that-which is.</p><p>The present is the only existence or, it is the existence.</p><p>BE in it and you are liberated. Live in it and there is bliss.</p><p>260</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>No ideology can help to create a new world or a new mind</p><p>or a new human being</p><p><br></p><p>because ideological orientation itself</p><p><br></p><p>is the root cause of all the conflicts and all the miseries. Thought
creates boundaries,</p><p>thought creates divisions</p><p><br></p><p>and thought creates prejudices –</p><p><br></p><p>and thought itself cannot bridge them; that is why all ideologies
fail.</p><p>Now man must learn to live without ideologies:</p><p><br></p><p>religious, political or otherwise.</p><p><br></p><p>When the mind is not tethered to any ideology it is free to move to
new understandings.</p><p>And in that freedom flowers all that is good and all that is
beautiful.</p><p>261</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>A disciple of Rinzai met a party of three men on a river bridge. One
of the three asked him: How deep is the river of meditation? Find out
for yourself, he said,</p><p>and offered to throw the questioner from the bridge.</p><p><br></p><p>But unfortunately the man ran away from him in time and escaped!</p><p><br></p><p>If you meet such a man who can throw you in the river be fortunate
enough to be thrown so!</p><p>And you have met such a man! Now be THROWN.</p><p>262</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>You possess only that which will not be lost in death;</p><p>all else is illusion – even the possessor,</p><p>because that too will not be able to stand the final shipwreck.</p><p>Then find out what is left. Turn in and meditate.</p><p>Discard all that is vulnerable to death.</p><p><br></p><p>Say: Not this, not that</p><p><br></p><p>and go deep to the point where nothing more remains to be
discarded</p><p>– and the illumination.</p><p><br></p><p>263</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Nothing great is ever accomplished without going mad, that is,
without breaking through</p><p>the ordinary level of consciousness</p><p><br></p><p>and letting loose the hidden powers lying further below, and also
penetrating to the realm that is further above.</p><p>– And it may not be true for any other great thing,</p><p><br></p><p>but it is absolutely true as far as meditation is concerned.
Meditation means MADNESS –</p><p>of course, with a method! 264</p><p>Love.</p><p>Detach yourself from all fixed ideas:</p><p><br></p><p>they are the killers of all livingness and innocence – which are
musts for illumination.</p><p>Beware of the trap of preconceptions;</p><p><br></p><p>they make a stagnant pool of your consciousness, and to meet the
ocean you need a dynamic one. Be alive and fluid and flowing –</p><p>then the goal is not far off. 265</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation is disciplined opening of the self to God.</p><p><br></p><p>Because of fear we are closed, and only love can become a door. So
love more –</p><p>or rather be loving, then there is less fear and less tension, and
you are more open.</p><p>This help meditation as nothing helps. Meditation plus love is the
path.</p><p>266</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Truth is never secondhand, it cannot be transferred.</p><p>One has to know it and be it oneself – that is why all tradition
falsifies it,</p><p>and all scriptures,</p><p>and all words, and in the end</p><p>it is nothing but the soup of Mulla Nasrudin... But first I must tell
you the story.</p><p>A kinsman came to see Nasrudin from the country and brought a
duck.</p><p>Nasrudin was grateful,</p><p><br></p><p>had the bird cooked, and shared it with the guest. Presently another
visitor arrived.</p><p>I am a friend, he said, of the man who gave you the duck. Nasrudin
fed him as well.</p><p>This happened several times.</p><p><br></p><p>Nasrudin’s house had become like a restaurant for out-of-town
visitors.</p><p>Everyone was a friend at some remove of the original donor of the
duck.</p><p>Finally Nasrudin was exasperated.</p><p><br></p><p>One day there was a knock at the door and a stranger appeared.</p><p>I am the friend of the friend of the friend of the man who brought
you the duck from the country, he said. Come in, said Nasrudin.</p><p>They seated themselves at the table</p><p><br></p><p>and Nasrudin asked his wife to bring the soup.</p><p>When the guest tasted it</p><p><br></p><p>it seemed to be nothing more than warm water. What sort of soup is
this? he asked the Mulla. That, said Nasrudin,</p><p>is the soup of the soup of the soup of the soup of the duck.</p><p>267</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Man is not a rational animal, but only a rationalizing one;</p><p>and that is more dangerous than just to be irrational. Give me a shot
of bourbon and a shot of water – said the obviously heavy drinker to the
bartender.</p><p>When the order was placed before him on the bar the lush pulled a
worm from his pocket</p><p>and dropped it into the glass of water.</p><p><br></p><p>After watching it swim around for a few seconds the man drew the worm
from the water</p><p>and dropped it into the whisky.</p><p><br></p><p>It wriggled briefly, then curled up and died. You see that? said the
lush to the bartender. It proves that if you keep on drinking whisky you
will never have worms.</p><p>268</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Life is a sermon;</p><p><br></p><p>existence preaches in its own way, but always indirectly –</p><p>and that is the beauty of it.</p><p><br></p><p>The harmony in nature teaches, without any intention,</p><p>the lesson of proportion m life. Look at a bird on the wing –</p><p>and you will go into meditation without effort, or listen to its song
–</p><p>and your heart will move with it without any motivation, and when
there is no effort on your part</p><p>the meditation goes deep and transforms you suddenly; and when there
is no motivation and you move –</p><p>the movement is in the divine. 269</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>I know your inner condition more than you know it yourself because
now your inner is not my outer.</p><p>Things that are happening to you unconsciously and even against your
conscious will are good. Welcome them and be grateful,</p><p>because nothing divine can happen to you with your will,</p><p>rather, your will is the only barrier in the way. Say wholeheartedly:
THY WILL BE DONE! and feel it</p><p>and live it.</p><p><br></p><p>Come home soon,</p><p><br></p><p>I am waiting for you,</p><p><br></p><p>and much is waiting to happen to you also. I know you are
sceptical.</p><p>That is not bad</p><p><br></p><p>but a good beginning to start with. Wherever there is mind there is
scepticism.</p><p>Mind IS scepticism and therefore conflict.</p><p>That is the way of the mind and its nature.</p><p>Please do not fight with it</p><p><br></p><p>and neither be identified with it. These are the obvious
alternatives, but both are false,</p><p>and aspects of the same coin. You will have to walk in between.</p><p>Come and be with me, and you will understand. 270</p><p>Dear Mukta.</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, you were related to Yoga Vivek in one of your past lives.</p><p><br></p><p>Now many things will be remembered by you soon because the key is in
your hands.</p><p>But do not think about them at all</p><p><br></p><p>otherwise your imagination will get mixed up with the memories and
then it will be difficult to know</p><p>what is real and what is not.</p><p><br></p><p>So be always aware from now</p><p><br></p><p>that you are not to think about past lives: let the memories come up
by themselves. No conscious effort on your part is needed; on the
contrary it will be a great hindrance. Let the unconscious do the
work,</p><p>you be just a witness,</p><p><br></p><p>and as the meditation will go deeper many locked doors will be opened
to you.</p><p>But always remember to wait for the mysteries to reveal
themselves.</p><p>The seed is broken – and much is to follow. You need only wait and be
a witness.</p><p>271</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Oh, just drop yourself into the divine and be purified!</p><p>Surrender and be reborn. Do not resist.</p><p>Let go!</p><p><br></p><p>272</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>See: this is a white paper – it contains words.</p><p>You can look at it as white paper or as words. Or, listen to the
silence which contains a sonata; you can be aware of the silence or of
the sonata. Or, think of the space which contains a building; you can be
aware of the space or of the building. Or, imagine an empty house;</p><p>you can conceive of it as the walls or as an emptiness.</p><p><br></p><p>If you see the words, the building, the sonata and the walls you are
in the mind,</p><p>but if you see the white paper or the silence or the space</p><p>or the emptiness</p><p><br></p><p>then you are in meditation. 273</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>From sound to soundlessness is the path. Intone a sound as A-U-M,</p><p>slowly, and as sound enters soundlessness so do you; or: remain in
the gap between any two sounds</p><p>and you yourself will become soundlessness; or: bathe in the
continuous sound of a waterfall, or any other;</p><p>or: by putting fingers in the ears</p><p><br></p><p>hear the source sound of all sounds – and there will be a sudden
explosion</p><p>of the silent music of the cosmos upon you.</p><p><br></p><p>In any way fall into the abyss of soundlessness and you will achieve
the divine.</p><p>274</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>I am thrilled with great expectations about you.</p><p><br></p><p>Oh, much is to happen within you and without also. You are on the
verge of the explosion,</p><p>so be alone.</p><p><br></p><p>Not lonely but alone,</p><p><br></p><p>and live with that aloneness. Rather, BE that aloneness;</p><p>that is the only meditation for you now. Loneliness is negative.</p><p>To be lonely is to be aware of the absence of others but to be alone
is the most positive state of mind.</p><p>It is to be aware of the presence of oneself: Be aware of the
presence that is you.</p><p>Just be aware and wait, wait for the happening.</p><p>Near, very near is the moment.</p><p><br></p><p>And remember that I am always with you.</p><p><br></p><p>I have always been with you even when you did not know me. And always
feel my blessings.</p><p>275</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Takuan says: You cannot bathe in solid ice, neither can you live in
frozen consciousness – and what is mind except that?</p><p>Go in and find out; do not ask anybody,</p><p>do not go to the scriptures, go in and find out.</p><p>Do not think about it because that is absurd –</p><p>how can you think against mind?</p><p><br></p><p>Any conclusion out of thinking can only strengthen the mind.</p><p>Do not think</p><p>because thinking is stopping, halting and freezing. Thinking is the
disease.</p><p>Go in and find out – IMMEDIATELY.</p><p><br></p><p>A moment’s thinking</p><p><br></p><p>and you are again in the old rut.</p><p><br></p><p>A moment’s thinking</p><p><br></p><p>and you are as far off from the real as is possible. 276</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>We kneel down to ourselves</p><p><br></p><p>because we kneel down to the gods we make</p><p><br></p><p>out of our experience or out of our desires and dreams or out of our
so called logic and foolish arguments.</p><p>This is neither humility nor prayer,</p><p><br></p><p>rather on the contrary this is the most egoistic attitude possible.
The true religious mind is one which just kneels down –</p><p>not to anyone, not to any image in particular.</p><p><br></p><p>This kneeling down is nothing but</p><p><br></p><p>a flowering of one’s total nothingness.</p><p><br></p><p>Then this kneeling down becomes an inner way of life, and unless
prayer is such, prayer is not.</p><p>One cannot pray, one can only be prayerful. 277</p><p>Love.</p><p>You cannot run away from the self because you are the self –</p><p>how can you run away from it?</p><p><br></p><p>It is like running from one’s own shadow and all your efforts are
bound to be futile. Rather, stop and see it,</p><p>witness it,</p><p><br></p><p>be aware of it.</p><p><br></p><p>Face the shadow and then – where is it? It has never been,
really.</p><p>You created it by not facing it</p><p><br></p><p>and you strengthened it by running from it. Is it not time enough now
to stop the game? 278</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Search – and the ego is always somewhere behind. Search – and in
every act the ego is the motivation.</p><p>But if one can find it so and can realize it</p><p>so one goes beyond it</p><p><br></p><p>because the very realization is the going beyond. Brother, said Mulla
Nasrudin to a neighbour,</p><p>I am collecting to pay the debt of a poor man who cannot meet his
obligations.</p><p>Very laudable, said the other, and gave him a coin. Who is this
person?</p><p>Me, said Nasrudin as he hurried away.</p><p><br></p><p>A few weeks later he was at the door again. I suppose you are calling
about a debt, said the non cynical neighbour.</p><p>I am.</p><p><br></p><p>I suppose someone can’t pay a debt and you want a contribution?</p><p>That is so.</p><p><br></p><p>I suppose it is you who owes the money? Not this time.</p><p>Well, I am glad to hear it.</p><p><br></p><p>Take this contribution.</p><p><br></p><p>Nasrudin pocketed the money. Just one thing Mulla –</p><p>what prompts your humanitarian sentiments in this particular
case?</p><p>Ah, you see...I am the creditor! 279</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Knowledge is through experiencing. Mere information is not
knowledge,</p><p>on the contrary it cannot give the clarity</p><p>which knowledge gives to the mind and may confuse one more</p><p>because a confused mind is still more burdened with it. Two men had
played chess regularly together for several years.</p><p>They were quite evenly matched</p><p><br></p><p>and there was keen rivalry between them.</p><p><br></p><p>Then one man began to beat his rival nearly every time they
played</p><p>and the other man was completely at a loss to understand this
phenomenon.</p><p>On the contrary, he was expecting his game to improve because he was
reading a four-volume set</p><p>on HOW TO PLAY CHESS!</p><p><br></p><p>After much thought he came up with an idea. He sent the books to his
friend as a gift –</p><p>and it was not long before they were evenly matched again!</p><p>280</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no proof of the divine in the world for it is hidden and
hidden and hidden.</p><p>But in you there is the absolute proof, for it is hidden and hidden
and hidden.</p><p>Go in and discover it. Thinking about it will not help:</p><p>action is needed, action upon oneself – so ACT.</p><p>That is, TURN IN.</p><p><br></p><p>Man is like a sealed book written before he was born,</p><p>and ordinarily he carries it unopened inside himself until he
dies.</p><p>One who opens it knows that HE IS NOT and only the divine is.</p><p>281</p><p><br></p><p>Truth is aristocratic;</p><p><br></p><p>it cannot be decided by votes or numbers because truth is enough in
itself,</p><p>it needs no help or support;</p><p><br></p><p>it needs no proof even because truth is self-evident.</p><p><br></p><p>A certain man was believed to have died and was being prepared for
burial</p><p>when he revived.</p><p><br></p><p>He sat up but</p><p><br></p><p>he was so shocked at the scene around him that he fainted. He was put
in a coffin</p><p>and the funeral party set off for the cemetery.</p><p><br></p><p>Just as they arrived at the grave he regained consciousness, lifted
the coffin lid</p><p>and cried out for help.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not possible that he has revived, said the mourners, because he
has been certified as dead by competent experts. BUT I AM ALIVE! shouted
the man.</p><p>He appealed to a well-known and impartial scientist and jurisprudent
who was present.</p><p>Just a moment, said the expert.</p><p><br></p><p>He then turned to the mourners, counting them:</p><p><br></p><p>Now we have heard what the alleged deceased has had to say; you fifty
witnesses tell me what you regard as the truth</p><p>He is dead, said the witnesses. Bury him, said the expert.</p><p>And so he was buried.</p><p><br></p><p>282</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Choice is the root cause of all anguish. CHOOSE and you always choose
hell – even when you choose heaven!</p><p>And who chooses hell directly? Yet everyone lives in hell!</p><p>Oh, the trick!</p><p>The gates of heaven open into hell! Then what is to be done?</p><p>Nothing at all,</p><p><br></p><p>because in doing nothing</p><p><br></p><p>you can rest content with all things as they are. and you have
knocked at the right door</p><p>without even knocking!</p><p><br></p><p>283</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Silence is benediction</p><p><br></p><p>but not the silence you can create, because you are the noise</p><p>so you cannot create silence:</p><p><br></p><p>but you can create the illusion of it,</p><p><br></p><p>and this illusion is created by all sorts of autohypnotic
techniques.</p><p>So never use autosuggestions to be silent;</p><p><br></p><p>rather, be aware of the constantly chattering mind, and be aware, not
to make it still, but to understand it,</p><p>and this very understanding flowers into a silence which is not just
absence of noise</p><p>but a positive bliss. 284</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>To explore truth one must be free of one’s prejudices – that is, from
oneself,</p><p>otherwise one goes round and round in circles –</p><p><br></p><p>because the known can never be the door for the unknown; and the
known is the mind,</p><p>so mind becomes the barrier:</p><p><br></p><p>look attentively at this fact.</p><p><br></p><p>Be alert to the vicious circle of the mind – and then there is
transcendence.</p><p>The known must cease for the unknown to be. The known must go for the
unknown to come in – and this cessation of the known is meditation.</p><p>285</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>The more deeply you go within yourself the less and less you will
find yourself –</p><p>and yet THAT is the very heart of your being. And vice versa
also:</p><p>because the more you go without</p><p><br></p><p>the more and more you will find yourself –</p><p><br></p><p>and yet that is the very heart of your non-being. These are the two
ways you can go.</p><p>The first is the way of meditation,</p><p>and the second is the way of the mind. 286</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Be ordinary, so ordinary that virtually you come to be nobody –</p><p>and there is the opening, and there is the explosion.</p><p>Only when you are not are you the extraordinary!</p><p><br></p><p>But do not think about it and do not crave for it,</p><p>and if the craving comes – be aware and laugh.</p><p><br></p><p>It will be stopped in awareness</p><p><br></p><p>and the created energy will be used by the laughter, and after the
laugh you will feel a deep relaxation.</p><p>Then begin to dance or sing</p><p><br></p><p>and the negative state of the mind will be transformed into the
positive.</p><p>The craving to be someone, somebody, is absolutely negative because
the ego is the negation of being.</p><p>The ego is the principle of negation,</p><p><br></p><p>and if the negative is negated then you are positive. The ego is the
source of all inferiority,</p><p>but the trick is subtle</p><p><br></p><p>because the ego promises superiority</p><p>and in the end only results in inferiority.</p><p><br></p><p>Decode this secret and understand it very clearly. One who thinks in
terms of superiority will remain always inferior</p><p>because these are two aspects of the same coin.</p><p><br></p><p>Oh! Sow the seeds of superiority</p><p><br></p><p>and you will reap the crop of inferiority.</p><p><br></p><p>Begin with the longing of superiority</p><p><br></p><p>and you will end with nothing but inferiority and all the hell that
is involved in it.</p><p>Begin with humbleness, with humility, and you are nearer to the
divine.</p><p>In fact you are divine</p><p><br></p><p>but the ego will not allow you any gap to look into your own
divinity.</p><p>on the contrary it will go on creating new imaginary heavens</p><p>only to make way for new hells.</p><p><br></p><p>Enter heaven and you are entering hell!</p><p><br></p><p>Beware of this, and beware of your so-called self – the creator of
all the agonies that exist on earth.</p><p>And be a no-self and you will be that which you are already and have
been always –</p><p>that which is bliss eternal,</p><p>and freedom,</p><p><br></p><p>and the cosmic being, the brahman. TAT TWAM ASI – that art thou, my
love. 287</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Man is unaware of himself.</p><p><br></p><p>He does not know what is happening to him, nor does he know the state
of his being.</p><p>A man cut down a tree one day.</p><p><br></p><p>A Sufi who saw this taking place said:</p><p><br></p><p>Look at this fresh branch which is full of sap and happy because it
does not know yet that it has been cut off.</p><p>But his companion said:</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, ignorant of the damage it has suffered it may be, but it will
know in due time.</p><p>Hearing this the Sufi laughed and said: Meanwhile you cannot reason
with it. This reverence is the state of man.</p><p>this ignorance is the state of man –</p><p><br></p><p>and meanwhile you cannot reason with him!

Even death is like that.</p><p>That is why I say:</p><p><br></p><p>Death is not dead but organically one with life. You cannot die
partially!</p><p>– either you die or you do not die.

has been run over.</p><p>289</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no use for artificial and outward discipline – the inner and
natural discipline is enough.</p><p>But what is the inner discipline? In one word: ACCEPTANCE – total
acceptance.</p><p>And acceptance can be only total</p><p><br></p><p>because partial acceptance is just a contradiction in terms.</p><p>If you live – live!</p><p><br></p><p>If you die – die!</p><p><br></p><p>If you suffer – suffer!</p><p><br></p><p>And then there is no problem and no anxiety</p><p>and no anguish – and what FREEDOM!</p><p>A Zen Master was once asked:</p><p><br></p><p>It is terribly hot, how shall we escape it Why not go, answered the
Master,</p><p>to the place where it is neither – neither hot nor cold?</p><p>Where is that place?</p><p><br></p><p>And then the Master laughed and said:</p><p><br></p><p>IN SUMMER WE SWEAT AND IN WINTER WE SHIVER.</p><p>290</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>How can a man learn to know himself? enquires Goethe, and then
answers:</p><p>Never by reflection but only by action. John Burroughs doubts
this.</p><p>He says:</p><p><br></p><p>Is not this a half-truth?</p><p><br></p><p>Because one can only learn his powers of action by action and his
powers of thought by thinking.</p><p>But I say that</p><p><br></p><p>man is always more than all his actions and all his thoughts, and
unless that MORE is known no one knows himself.</p><p>That MORE can be known neither by action nor by reflection because
they both belong to the periphery</p><p>and that MORE IS eternally the centre.</p><p><br></p><p>It can only be known witnessing action and thought both: not BY them
but by witnessing them.</p><p>And witnessing IS meditation. 291</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no answer to man’s ultimate questions because the questions
are absurd,</p><p>and moreover there is no one to answer them.</p><p>Existence is silent and has always been so, so do not ask</p><p>but be silent and live it and know it. because there is no knowing

also.</p><p>293</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation cannot be taught directly because it is not a mechanical
technique, but a living art.</p><p>Dogo had a disciple called Soshin. Soshin waited long with his Master
to be taught the art of meditation.</p><p>He expected lessons the way a schoolboy is taught at school, but
there were no special lessons coming,</p><p>and this bewildered and disappointed the disciple. One day he said to
the Master:</p><p>It is a long time since I came here but not a word has been given to
me regarding the essence of meditation.</p><p>Dogo laughed at this heartily and said: What are you saying, my
boy?</p><p>Since your arrival</p><p>I have ever been giving you lessons on the matter! At this the poor
disciple was even more bewildered and for some time he could not think
what to say.</p><p>Then one day he gathered courage and asked again: What kind of lesson
could it have been, sir?</p><p>Dogo said:</p><p><br></p><p>When you bring me a cup of tea in the morning, I take it; when you
serve me a meal, I accept it</p><p>and when you bow to me I return it with a nod. How else do you expect
to be taught in meditation?</p><p>Soshin hung his head</p><p><br></p><p>and began to think about the puzzling words of the Master, but at
this the Master said again:</p><p>If you want to see, SEE, RIGHT AT ONCE, because when you begin to
think</p><p>you miss the point altogether. 294</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditate, pray and wait.</p><p><br></p><p>Do not will anything,</p><p><br></p><p>for in you there is strength greater than any strength of your
own.</p><p>But it works only when your will is at rest. 295</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Be free at the centre;</p><p><br></p><p>let the centre relax and die:</p><p><br></p><p>be a circumference only –</p><p><br></p><p>and this is the only renunciation I know.</p><p><br></p><p>No man is free until he is free at the centre. When he lets go then
he is free indeed – and then life is not anguish</p><p>and then life is not agony</p><p><br></p><p>because no hell can exist without the self, the centre. 296</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Do you hear me?</p><p><br></p><p>Do you see me?</p><p><br></p><p>I stand at the door and knock,</p><p><br></p><p>and I block because of a promise made in another life and another

returns.</p><p>It is the source and ground of all existence. So whenever I say

should he behave?</p><p>The Master answered: Cut off your dualism</p><p><br></p><p>and let THE ONE SWORD stand serenely by itself against the sky!</p><p>302</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>The real thing is</p><p><br></p><p>not to fight with your thoughts or desires or instincts</p><p>because that is negative</p><p><br></p><p>and the negative cannot help. The real thing is</p><p>to grow in awareness in meditation</p><p><br></p><p>because then one wins without any fight whatsoever – and to win
through conflict is not a real victory because that which has been
suppressed</p><p>will have to be suppressed again and again. Through conflict there is
no end to conflict and through fight only more fight is born.</p><p>But there is a victory</p><p><br></p><p>without any conflict, fight or suppression.</p><p><br></p><p>That victory comes through positive growth in awareness.</p><p><br></p><p>Do not fight with yourself</p><p><br></p><p>but grow in awareness and understanding and silence, and all that is
negative and diseased</p><p>will have withered away by itself. Suzuki tells a story:</p><p>Chi Hsing Tzu was raising a fighting cock for his lord. Ten days
passed and the lord asked:</p><p>Is he ready? Chi answered:</p><p><br></p><p>No sir, he is not ready.</p><p><br></p><p>He is still vain and flushed with rage.</p><p><br></p><p>Another ten days passed and the prince asked about the cock.</p><p>Chi said: Not yet, sir.</p><p><br></p><p>He is on the alert whenever he sees the shadow of</p><p>another cock</p><p><br></p><p>or hears its crowing.</p><p><br></p><p>Still another ten days passed</p><p><br></p><p>and when the inquiry came from the prince, Chi replied: Not quite
yet, sir.</p><p>His sense of fighting is still smouldering within him ready to be
awakened.</p><p>When another ten days elapsed</p><p><br></p><p>Chi replied in response to the inquiry:</p><p><br></p><p>He is almost ready.</p><p><br></p><p>Even when he hears another crowing he shows no excitement. He has now
become positive.</p><p>He has grown in subtle inner awareness.</p><p><br></p><p>Now he resembles one made of wood, he is so quiet and silent. His
qualities are integrated.</p><p>No cock is his match</p><p><br></p><p>and to win he will not have to fight</p><p><br></p><p>because other cocks will at once run away from him. They cannot face
him now.</p><p>And really it proved so.</p><p><br></p><p>He won fights without fighting at all.</p><p><br></p><p>Aud I say that you can do likewise with yourself: learn the secret
from Chi Hsing Tzu’s cock!</p><p>303</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Everything has happened as it should happen.</p><p><br></p><p>And l was surprised not because you ran away from here but because I
never thought you could be so predictable!</p><p>It is not from here that you have escaped</p><p><br></p><p>it is only a vain effort to escape from yourself: Which is
impossible.</p><p>How can one escape from oneself?</p><p><br></p><p>But in meditation a moment comes necessarily when the mind tries the
impossible –</p><p>or the mind this is the last defensive act. Meditation is ultimately
suicidal to the mind.</p><p>And of course the mind must be given a chance! And you have given
it!</p><p>Meditation is encountering yourself directly and in your total
nakedness.</p><p>This creates fear and the futile effort to escape.</p><p><br></p><p>The effort is futile because whatsoever is known once is known for
ever</p><p>and you cannot be the old ignorant one again.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no way to go back and there is no bridge.</p><p>This escape too will make you more mature and you will come back
strengthened through it</p><p>and because of it.</p><p><br></p><p>Now relax there under the sky and beside the sea and I will be
there.</p><p>Whenever you are relaxed you will feel my presence. And when you feel
like coming, come back –</p><p>nd soon you will feel this.</p><p><br></p><p>I will be waiting here for you as ever.</p><p><br></p><p>COME and recontinue the arduous journey towards your self.</p><p>304</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>I know that the apprenticeship is very hard but worth it.</p><p>So keep on.</p><p><br></p><p>It is arduous, but one has to pay for everything,</p><p><br></p><p>and in no other way can you get to THE GREAT TREASURE.</p><p><br></p><p>You have longed for it for lives and lives</p><p><br></p><p>and now when the time is ripe and the key is being given to you DO
NOT LOSE COURAGE.</p><p>The access to the treasure is difficult</p><p><br></p><p>because it is hidden in our own unconscious layers of the mind.</p><p><br></p><p>It will be easy if you approach that threshold when the diurnal tide
favours,</p><p>that is when you are passing from sleep to waking</p><p>or from waking to sleep.</p><p><br></p><p>Evening and morning</p><p><br></p><p>are therefore probably the best times for meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>You might have noticed that when the mind</p><p><br></p><p>is recovering from sleep it takes at least fifteen minutes to close
one aperture and open fully the other.</p><p>That is why dreams cannot last longer than that in memory after
waking.</p><p>When the mind is approaching sleep it again passes the same
threshold. BE AWARE OF THIS THRESHOLD</p><p>because it is very significant</p><p><br></p><p>for those who are in search of the inner treasure. This threshold is
the gate to the unknown</p><p>This threshold,</p><p><br></p><p>this gap between waking and sleep, must be used for meditation.</p><p>Be aware of the gap,</p><p><br></p><p>be a witness of the interval, and you will be transformed. 305</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>I know what is happening to you – the nothingness is descending, the
emptiness is increasing.</p><p>Welcome it, and rejoice in its coming.</p><p><br></p><p>Dance in ecstasy because there is no other way to welcome it. And the
more you dance the more you will die.</p><p>And when you are dead completely you will be reborn. And the moment
is near, very near – just by the corner. You have passed through the
entrance-explosion and now be ready for the ultimate.</p><p>Look at yourself once more as the river looks at itself before
falling into the ocean, because after falling into the ocean there will
be no one to look, and no one to be looked at!</p><p>306</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>What is meditation?</p><p><br></p><p>Hsu Yun says: Meditation lies in laying down. But laying down
what?</p><p>Laying down yourself – because nothing less will do. Have you ever
been at the bedside of a dead man? If you try to scold him he will not
be excited,</p><p>and even if you strike him with a staff he will not strike back.</p><p><br></p><p>He also indulged before in the same things everyone indulges in. He
also longed for reputation and wealth.</p><p>But now he is just without any longing whatsoever. Now he does not
make any distinctions</p><p>and lays down everything.</p><p><br></p><p>If you cul be in this laying down state – alive, you are in
meditation.</p><p>307</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Leave the grasping of things and thoughts.</p><p><br></p><p>Open your fist completely because grasping is suffering. Halt! cries
Buddha.</p><p>But the mad mind does not halt. If it halts, it is Enlightenment!</p><p>308</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Love to be alone.</p><p><br></p><p>Solitude is the temple of the divine,</p><p><br></p><p>and remember that there is no other temple. 309</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Do not be closed to the universe.</p><p><br></p><p>Open all your doors and windows</p><p><br></p><p>and let everything pass freely in and out, out and in, because only
then will you be able to receive the truth. 31O</p><p>Love.</p><p>Ego plays a subtle role everywhere – not only in men but in mice
also!</p><p>An arrogant elephant looked down contemptuously at a mouse and said:
You are just about the puniest little creature</p><p>I have ever seen.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not always like this, squeaked the mouse. I’ve been sick!</p><p>311</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole yoga has gone dead because of imitation. One cannot imitate
anything that is real,</p><p>the real is always spontaneous:</p><p><br></p><p>one can jump into it but one cannot practise it. Any practice is of
the mind and by the mind – and the mind is the past, the dead;</p><p>the mind is the thing one has to jump out of. Out of the mind is the
explosion,</p><p>so be aware of the mind and its tricks!</p><p><br></p><p>Mamiya went to a great teacher to learn meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>The teacher told him to concentrate on the famous koan: What is the
sound of one hand?</p><p>Mamiya went away</p><p><br></p><p>and came back a week later shaking his head. He could not get it.</p><p>Get out! said the Master. You are not trying hard enough. You still
think of money and food and pleasure.</p><p>It would be better if you died, then you might learn the answer.</p><p>The next week Mamiya came back again. When the Master asked him:</p><p>Well, what is the sound of one hand? – he clutched at his heart,
groaned</p><p>and fell down as if dead.</p><p><br></p><p>Well, you have taken my advice and died, said the Master, but what
about the sound?</p><p>Mamiya opened one eye:</p><p><br></p><p>I have not solved that yet, he said. Dead men don’t speak, said the
Master. Get up and get out!</p><p>312</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>We settle down where no settling is possible.</p><p><br></p><p>We make homes</p><p><br></p><p>whilst homelessness is the very nature of our consciousness. Oh, we
go on doing things which are impossible and then suffer! But no one else
is responsible.</p><p>We fight with the void and are then defeated – not because the void
is stronger than us</p><p>but because it is not.</p><p><br></p><p>Now stand up and fight with the empty space of the room so that you
can know and taste</p><p>the whole stupidity of the human mind. And then sit down and laugh at
yourself, and as the laughter dies down</p><p>be silent and search within,</p><p><br></p><p>and then you will come to know a deep mystery: the mystery that the
void is not only without</p><p>but within also!</p><p><br></p><p>313</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Death is everywhere</p><p><br></p><p>but everyone deceives himself that it is not for him; this is the
greatest</p><p>and the deepest deception the human mind is capable of; and unless
one is constantly aware of this fact</p><p>one is bound to be a victim of this deception – because the mind goes
on giving</p><p>very beautiful and logical rationalizations up to the very end.</p><p>I have heard about a ninety-year-old man</p><p><br></p><p>who got into a bitter argument with his shoemaker as to how a pair of
shoes should be made.</p><p>See here, said the shoemaker,</p><p><br></p><p>What’s the idea of doing so much yapping You are past ninety</p><p>and there is little chance of your living long enough to wear these
shoes out.</p><p>The old fellow looked sternly at the shoemaker</p><p><br></p><p>and said: Apparently you are not aware that statistics prove that
very few people die after ninety years of age!</p><p>314</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Information is not knowledge</p><p><br></p><p>because information is not transformation and can never be –</p><p>and knowledge comes only through transformation. Information is
adding something to the same old mind. It is quantitative;</p><p>there is no qualitative change</p><p><br></p><p>because the mind behind remains the same. That is why all that is
called education just proves superficial.</p><p>Mind must go through qualitative change otherwise there is no
wisdom;</p><p>and to go on adding information to ignorance is fatal. I call
meditation</p><p>the method for mind’s total mutation</p><p><br></p><p>First let there be a transformation of the very quality of the
mind</p><p>and only then education can be educative.</p><p><br></p><p>In ancient times</p><p><br></p><p>the king of a certain country was concerned because his son was
something of a fool.</p><p>The king’s counsellors urged that the son be sent away to a great
university in another land</p><p>in the hope that the boy would acquire learning and wisdom.</p><p>The king agreed.</p><p><br></p><p>The son studied hard for several years then wrote his father that he
had learned just about everything possible</p><p>and pleaded to be allowed to return home. The king assented.</p><p>When the son arrived at the palace the king was overjoyed.</p><p><br></p><p>A great feast was prepared</p><p><br></p><p>and all the great men of the kingdom were invited.</p><p><br></p><p>At the end of the festivities</p><p><br></p><p>one of the sages present asked the son what he had learned.</p><p><br></p><p>The young man ticked off the university’s curriculum that he had gone
through. While the lad was talking</p><p>the sage slipped a ring off his finger, closed his hand over it,</p><p>held up his hand and asked: What do I hold in my hand? The son though
for a moment and said;</p><p>It is a round object with a hole in the centre. The sage was
astonished at such wisdom. Maybe the lad had become a great mind.</p><p>Will you now name the object? asked the sage.</p><p><br></p><p>The king’s son pondered for a few moments, then said:</p><p><br></p><p>The sciences that I studied do not aid me in answering your
question,</p><p>but my own commonsense tells me that it is a cartwheel.</p><p><br></p><p>The sage concluded to himself</p><p><br></p><p>that you can educate a fool but you cannot make him think.</p><p>315</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, there is a WAY,</p><p><br></p><p>but in many the will is lacking to find it. And it is not far
away,</p><p>it is just by the corner, so to say.</p><p><br></p><p>Knowingly or unknowingly all men long for it. Really, the whole life
is a longing for it because without it</p><p>there is no reaching, no flowering, no fulfilment.</p><p><br></p><p>But few men seek it</p><p><br></p><p>and still fewer seek it rightly and still fewer find it –</p><p>and all of those who find it do not enter.</p><p><br></p><p>Only a few enter</p><p><br></p><p>and still fewer progressively follow it.</p><p><br></p><p>But those who follow it with their total being realize that the way
is the goal itself!</p><p>316</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Mind and meditation are two names of the same substance, or the same
energy.</p><p>Mind is energy flowing in dualisms, in conflict and dis-ease,</p><p>and meditation is non-dual energy, one with itself and at case.</p><p>Thinking is impossible without dualisms,</p><p><br></p><p>that is why meditation asks to go beyond thinking. The moment there
is no thinking –</p><p>or a single ripple of thought – the energy becomes integrated and
there is qualitative change. The no-thinking energy</p><p>opens the door of the dimensionless dimension.</p><p><br></p><p>So refrain from seeking even Enlightenment or Buddhahood because with
any seeking whatsoever</p><p>he mechanism of thought begins to operate and create dualisms.</p><p>317</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Do not forget the search for the divine for even a single moment
because the time is always short and the task is great</p><p>and besides, the mind is wavering. In fact the mind IS the
wavering.</p><p>Remember this, and remain aware of this fact as much as you can</p><p>because the moment one is aware the wavering stops, and in the
intervals are the glimpses:</p><p>glimpses of oneself, glimpses of no-mind.</p><p><br></p><p>One has to transcend the wavering of the mind absolutely before one
comes to the doors of the beloved.</p><p>NO-MINDEDNESS IS THE DOOR.</p><p><br></p><p>And the door is not far off. But the seeker is asleep. Mind is the
sleep.</p><p>That is why you will have to be attentive and alert of everything
that passes before your</p><p>consciousness –</p><p><br></p><p>even be attentive of the inattentive moments.</p><p><br></p><p>Through constant awareness the spiritual sleep will be broken and you
will he transformed.</p><p>This is your potentiality.</p><p><br></p><p>This is everyone’s potentiality. and for you the time is ripe.</p><p>But the seed can remain a seed and die. The opportunity can be
lost.</p><p>You are free to be that which you are meant to be or to be that which
you are not meant to be.</p><p>Man is free to be or not to be –</p><p><br></p><p>this is the glory and this is the burden. Freedom means
responsibility,</p><p>SO BE CAREFUL.</p><p><br></p><p>If you can be that which is your potentiality, if you can flower to
your fullness</p><p>then there is bliss then there is ecstasy,</p><p>otherwise ashes are in the hands and anguish in the heart – and
ultimately everything depends on you:</p><p>heaven or hell –</p><p><br></p><p>and you and only you will be responsible for it. SO BE CAREFUL.</p><p>My blessings are always with you. 318</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Metaphysics is born out of childish curiosity, so howsoever sublime,
it remains juvenile.</p><p>And all the ultimate answers are foolish in a way</p><p><br></p><p>because the ultimate is not only unknown, it is unknowable.</p><p><br></p><p>A mature mind is one</p><p><br></p><p>who understands the impossibility of knowing the ultimate, and with
this understanding</p><p>there is a new dimension:</p><p><br></p><p>the dimension of being.</p><p><br></p><p>Knowing is not possible, but being is. Or in other word:</p><p>in relation to the ultimate only – being is knowing.</p><p>This dimension is the religious dimension and unless one is religious
in this sense one goes on asking absurd questions</p><p>and accumulating even more absurd answers.</p><p><br></p><p>In a little backwoods school</p><p><br></p><p>the teacher was at the blackboard explaining arithmetic problems.</p><p>She was delighted to see her dullest pupil</p><p>giving slack-jawed attention, which was unusual for him.</p><p>Her happy thought was that at last</p><p><br></p><p>the gangling lad was beginning to understand. When she finished she
said to him:</p><p>YOU were so interested, Cicero.</p><p><br></p><p>that I am sure you want to ask some questions. Yes’m, drawled Cicero,
I got one to ask.</p><p>Where do those figures go when you rub them off? 319</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Do not cling to anything, to any idea,</p><p>because clinging is the bondage. Even if one is clinging to the idea
of liberation –</p><p>moksha or nirvana, one will be in bondage.</p><p>With clinging meditation is impossible because clinging is mind – the
bondage, and no-clinging is meditation –</p><p>the freedom.</p><p><br></p><p>In the BOOK OF AMU DARIA there is an old Sufi tale: Once upon a time
there was a monkey</p><p>who was very fond of cherries.</p><p><br></p><p>One day he saw a delicious looking cherry and came down from his tree
to get it,</p><p>but the fruit turned out to be in a clear glass bottle, so he had to
put his hand into the bottle to get it out.</p><p>As soon as he had done so he closed his hand over the cherry but then
he found</p><p>that he could not withdraw his fist holding the cherry because it was
larger than the internal dimensions of the bottle’s neck.</p><p>Now all this was deliberate</p><p><br></p><p>because the cherry in the bottle was a trap laid by a monkey
hunter</p><p>who knew how monkeys think.</p><p><br></p><p>The hunter, hearing the monkey’s whimperings, came along and the
monkey tried to run away,</p><p>but because his hand was, as he thought, stuck in the bottle.</p><p>he could not move fast enough to escape.</p><p><br></p><p>But as he thought he still had hold of the cherry he consoled
himself.</p><p>The hunter picked him up</p><p><br></p><p>and tapped the monkey sharply on the elbow making him suddenly relax
his hold on the fruit.</p><p>The monkey was now free – but he was captured.</p><p>The hunter had used the cherry and the bottle and he still had
them.</p><p>This monkey-way of thinking is the mind-way also! And in the end when
death, the hunter, comes everyone is found caught in his own bottle.</p><p>Remember, before the hunter comes make sure your hand is out of the
bottle! 320</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>A life without meditation is like a winter landscape with the sun
hidden,</p><p>the flowers frozen</p><p><br></p><p>and the wind whispering through the withered leaves.</p><p><br></p><p>And everyone knows it</p><p><br></p><p>because everyone lives it that way, though no one needs to live it
that way But why is this so?</p><p>This is so because life’s needs require an occupied mind and
meditation means unoccupiedness.</p><p>We train ourselves to be occupied</p><p><br></p><p>and then forget that one needs to be unoccupied sometimes to know the
ecstasy of sheer existence.</p><p>One is to be totally vacant inside</p><p><br></p><p>because only then is one a host to the divine guest. 321</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation is beyond knowledge. You can be it but you cannot know it.
All knowledge is superficial.</p><p>It is never anything else but acquaintance from outside.</p><p><br></p><p>It is always about</p><p><br></p><p>but never the thing itself;</p><p><br></p><p>When the Chinese emperor Wu came to meet Bodhidharma he asked the
Master:</p><p>What is the holy ultimate truth? Bodhidharma laughed and replied:</p><p>Nothing holy, sir,</p><p><br></p><p>and it is emptiness itself.</p><p><br></p><p>Of course Wu was taken aback, but he asked again: Then who is the one
who at present stands confronting me?</p><p>Bodhidharma simply said: I don’t know.</p><p>Do you see the beauty of it? And the truth?</p><p>And the innocence?</p><p>And the holiness?</p><p><br></p><p>And the fullness?</p><p><br></p><p>And the absolute ultimateness? 322</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>It is very easy to progress from one illusion to another because no
foundational transformation is needed.</p><p>There is no shaking of the foundations because you remain the
same.</p><p>So the real problem is not to change the objects of desire from the
worldly to the other-worldly</p><p>but to transform oneself; not to change the seeking but to change the
seeker –</p><p>otherwise the problem remains as it is, only it takes new shapes.</p><p>But how to change the seeker.</p><p><br></p><p>First find it out – where it is and what it is.</p><p><br></p><p>and then you will come to know a hidden secret: that the seeker
exists only until it is not sought, and when someone goes to search it
out –</p><p>it is never found.</p><p><br></p><p>It exists only in ignorance and in darkness; in awareness it is
not:</p><p>and this realization of no-self is the jump. Jump into the
unknown.</p><p>Jump into the truth.</p><p><br></p><p>323</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Whatever I say is nothing new; nor is it anything old.</p><p>Or it is both –</p><p><br></p><p>the oldest and the newest.</p><p><br></p><p>And to know it you need not listen to me.</p><p><br></p><p>Oh! Listen to the birds in the morning</p><p><br></p><p>or to the flowers and grass blades in the sun and you will hear
it,</p><p>and if you do not know how to listen then you will not know from me
either.</p><p>So the real thing is not what you listen to but HOW you listen
because the message is everywhere, everywhere, everywhere. Now I will
tell you the art of listening:</p><p>roam about until exhausted or dance or do vigorous breathing and
then, dropping to the ground, listen;</p><p>or repeat your own name loudly until exhausted and then suddenly stop
and listen;</p><p>or at the point of sleep when sleep has not yet come</p><p>and external wakefulness vanishes be alert suddenly and listen</p><p>AND THEN YOU WILL HEAR ME. 324</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>That which is never lost cannot be found, and to search for it is
absurd.</p><p>But the moment this absurdity is understood all seeking stops by
itself</p><p>and that which is never lost is found! That is why I say:</p><p>SEEK AND YOU WILL NOT FIND,</p><p><br></p><p>because the very seeking is the barrier.</p><p><br></p><p>The search itself is the hindrance</p><p><br></p><p>because it creates the seeker, the ego, the illusion that I am,</p><p>and I am not.</p><p><br></p><p>Do not seek and you will find it:</p><p><br></p><p>the I-AM-NOTNESS.</p><p><br></p><p>This nothingness is the gate. THE GATELESS GATE.</p><p>Riko once asked Nansen</p><p><br></p><p>to explain to him the old problem of the goose in the bottle. If a
man puts a gosling into the bottle, he said,</p><p>and feeds the gosling through the bottle’s neck until it grows and
grows and becomes a goose –</p><p>and then there is just no more room inside the bottle, how can the
man get it out without killing the goose or breaking the bottle?</p><p>RIKO! shouted Nansen, and gave a great clap with his hands.</p><p>Yes Master! said Riko with a start. See! said Nansen.</p><p>The goose is out!</p><p><br></p><p>325</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation requires understanding and not effort, understanding is
essential, not effort,</p><p>and remember always that you cannot substitute understanding with any
effort whatsoever.</p><p>But what do I mean by understanding?</p><p><br></p><p>By understanding I mean – living a natural life. Of course, you
cannot try to be natural,</p><p>that is self-contradictory!</p><p><br></p><p>You can BE natural but you cannot try to be natural. Do you
understand this?</p><p>Suzuki tells a story:</p><p>A monk once asked one of the old Chinese Masters: What is the
way?</p><p>he Master replied:The natural one, the ordinary one, is the way.</p><p>How, continued the monk, am I to be in accord with it? When you try
to be in accord with it, said the Master, then you deviate from it.</p><p>Does this mean that one should not try? No, because that too is a way
of trying. – Of course, indirect, but still intentional; that too will
not help.</p><p>But just see the dilemma clearly and you are out of it. ARE YOU,
NOT?</p><p>326</p><p><br></p><p>Love and blessings. Received your letter.</p><p>I was waiting for it daily since you left.</p><p><br></p><p>I know that you have gone far away from here</p><p><br></p><p>but I also know that now you cannot go away from me – and that
nearness is all that counts.</p><p>YOU have come near to me in a nonspatial and nontemporal sense.</p><p>The meeting has taken place in the nowhere or in the everywhere</p><p>because they both mean the same thing.</p><p><br></p><p>And the real meeting takes place only in this way. All else is
illusion.</p><p>Remember me whenever you need and you will find me then and
there.</p><p>Ask anything and wait – and you will be answered.</p><p><br></p><p>The barriers have fallen down from your mind and you have entered the
meditative state.</p><p>Now the doors of the divine are open do not hesitate, and take the
plunge. You are completely ready,</p><p>only just be courageous to enter the uncharted and the unknown.</p><p>The call from beyond has come –</p><p><br></p><p>now accept the challenge and be fulfilled.</p><p><br></p><p>Now close your eyes</p><p><br></p><p>and feel me and see me and let my blessings be showered on you.</p><p>327</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Oh, don’t take life so seriously!</p><p><br></p><p>Because seriousness is a great dis-ease, and not only a disease but a
suicide also. Be playful – totally</p><p>because that is the only way to be living.</p><p><br></p><p>Life is a play, a leela, and to know it so is religion, and to live
it so is sannyas – renunciation.</p><p>If you can act and live as if acting and living in a dream and still
be a witness to it</p><p>then you will be in the cosmic flow, the tao. And to be in the cosmic
flow is to be free – free from oneself, the ego.</p><p>The ego is the seriousness, the disease,</p><p><br></p><p>and the tao, the egoless existence, is the bliss, the ecstasy.</p><p>That is why I have given you a name so absurd! But I have given it to
you knowingly.</p><p>I have given it to you so that you may never be identified with
it.</p><p><br></p><p>The name is so absurd</p><p><br></p><p>that you will have to remain nameless and nobody behind it, and the
name is such that</p><p>not only others but you yourself will be able to laugh at it. Swami
Krishna Christ!</p><p>Oh, what a name!</p><p><br></p><p>But perfectly suitable in a dream drama. is it not so</p><p>So feel at ease with it.</p><p><br></p><p>and laugh with it, and sing and dance with it</p><p>and be SWAMI KRISHNA CHRIST with all the letters in capital!</p><p>And always remember that you are nobody.</p><p><br></p><p>And always be aware that</p><p><br></p><p>you are neither a swami nor a Krishna nor a Christ –</p><p>that is what is meant by a swami! And Krishna himself is not a
Krishna and Christ himself is not a Christ</p><p>because they are nameless, absolutely nameless.</p><p><br></p><p>They are nobodies – and that is what makes them divine.</p><p><br></p><p>The moment one is identified with any name one is lost to one’s
divinity.</p><p>Either one can be a name or a reality, and no one can be both
simultaneously. Be a name really –</p><p>and your reality is lost.</p><p><br></p><p>Be a reality really –</p><p><br></p><p>and your name is just a dream – maya. And what nonsense to be a
swami!</p><p>But once one is at ease with the no sense one transcends it.</p><p><br></p><p>Please! Don’t try to be sensible</p><p><br></p><p>otherwise you will never be with any sense at all! Because only
stupidity tries to be sensible!</p><p>The existence is absurd and meaningless</p><p>and irrational</p><p><br></p><p>and that is why it is so beautiful. And to be in it such a blessing!
328</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Man is free to decide, but not free not to decide – because not to
decide is to decide,</p><p>to waver is to decide,</p><p><br></p><p>to postpone and evade decision is to decide. There is no escape:</p><p>one must say yes or no.</p><p><br></p><p>And there are a thousand ways of saying no, only one way of saying
yes,</p><p>ant no way of not saying anything at all.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the human situation</p><p><br></p><p>and the seeker of truth must be aware of it otherwise life is wasted
unnecessarily.</p><p>A single moment lost cannot be regained – ant we have wasted so many
lives –</p><p>so decide to decide,</p><p><br></p><p>and decide to transform and transcend. With the decision comes
crystallization</p><p>and then one is ready to take the jump into the unknown. 329</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>traveller stops at an inn He passes the night there, takes his
meal,</p><p>and as soon as he has done so</p><p><br></p><p>he packs and continues his journey again.</p><p><br></p><p>As for the host of the inn, he has nowhere to go. The one who does
not stay is the guest,</p><p>and the one who stays is the host. Now who are you –</p><p>the guest or the host Meditate.</p><p>No answer is required, rather – REALIZE.</p><p>because all answers belong to the guest and realization only to the
host.</p><p>But do not believe me, I may be just deceiving you. Go in and find
out for yourself!</p><p>330</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation is the masterkey.</p><p><br></p><p>It can open the doors of the infinite</p><p>and it can unlock the mystery of the unknown.</p><p><br></p><p>But just by possessing the key nothing is attained, unless one uses
it.</p><p>Idries Shah tells a dervish tale:</p><p><br></p><p>There was once a wise and very rich man who had a son. He said to
him:</p><p>My son, here is a jewelled ring.</p><p><br></p><p>Keep it is a sign that you are a successor of mine and pass it down
to your posterity.</p><p>It is of value, of fine appearance,</p><p><br></p><p>and it has the added capacity of opening a certain door to
wealth.</p><p>Some years later he had another son.</p><p><br></p><p>When he was old enough</p><p><br></p><p>the wise man gave him another ring with the same advice.</p><p>The same thing happened in the case of his third and last son.</p><p>When the Ancient had died and the sons grew up one after the other
each claimed primacy for himself because of his possession of one of the
rings.</p><p>Nobody could tell for certain which was the most valuable. Each son
gained his adherents,</p><p>all claiming a greater value and beauty for his own ring.</p><p>But the curious thing was that</p><p><br></p><p>the door to wealth remained shut for the possessors of the keys and
even their closest supporters.</p><p>They were all too preoccupied with the problem of precedence, the
possession of the ring, its value and appearance.</p><p>Only a few looked for the door to the treasury of the Ancient. The
rings had a magical quality too.</p><p>Although they were keys</p><p><br></p><p>they were not used directly in opening the door to the treasury.</p><p><br></p><p>It was sufficient to look upon them</p><p><br></p><p>without contention or too much attachment to one or other of their
qualities.</p><p>When this had been done the people who had looked</p><p>were able to tell where the treasury was</p><p><br></p><p>and could open it merely by producing the outline of the ring. The
treasuries had another quality too:</p><p>they were inexhaustible.</p><p><br></p><p>Meanwhile the partisans of the three rings repeated the tales of
their ancestors about the merits of the rings,</p><p>each in a slightly different way.</p><p><br></p><p>The first community thought they had already found the treasure
because they had the key.</p><p>The second thought that it was allegorical and thereby consoled
themselves.</p><p>And the third transferred the possibility of opening the door</p><p>to a distant and remotely imagined future time and therefore for them
there was nothing to do at present.</p><p>There is every possibility</p><p><br></p><p>for you also to belong to one of these three communities because
anyone who begins to search</p><p>is always prone to fall into the trap of any one of the three.
Really, these are the three basic tricks the mind can play to save
itself from meditation</p><p>So beware of these old tricks. 331</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Look at yourself without thinking, evaluating, or judging, without
any liking or disliking;</p><p>that is, without any movement of the mind or without the noise of the
mind:</p><p>then you have eyes</p><p><br></p><p>which are altogether different from your eyes because they are not
burdened by the past. They are innocent and silent,</p><p>and in this silence</p><p><br></p><p>there is neither the observer nor the observed – but that which
is,</p><p>undivided and one, beginningless and endless.</p><p>You can call it God or nirvana or anything whatsoever –</p><p>the name does not matter because the name is not the thing, and when
one has known the thing</p><p>one does not bother about the value. 332</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Begin the following meditation from tomorrow – and know that this is
an order!</p><p>Now you are so mine</p><p><br></p><p>that I cannot do anything else but order! Prerequirements:</p><p>Do it cheerfully. Do it relaxedly. Be playful.</p><p>Do it in the morning after taking a bath. The meditation:</p><p>First: breathe deeply and rhythmically, not fast</p><p>but slowly,</p><p><br></p><p>for ten minutes.</p><p><br></p><p>Second: dance rhythmically and slowly; be ecstatic, as if flowing in
it:</p><p>for ten minutes.</p><p><br></p><p>Third: use the mahamantra: hoo-hoo-hoo; continue dancing and
moving;</p><p>do not be serious, do not be tense; for ten minutes.</p><p>Fourth: close the eyes and be silent; do not move or dance now;</p><p>stand, sit or lie town, as you feel to do, but just be as if
dead,</p><p>feel sinking in,</p><p><br></p><p>surrender and be in the hands of the whole; for ten minutes.</p><p>Postrequirements:</p><p><br></p><p>One: live the whole day in ecstasy. in intoxication of the divine,
flowing and flowering in it,</p><p>and whenever depressed say inwardly: hoo-hoo-hoo, and laugh
outwardly,</p><p>laugh without any reason, and accept the madness. Two: before sleep
chant the mahamantra: hoo-hoo-hoo</p><p>for ten minutes,</p><p><br></p><p>then laugh at yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>Three: in the morning as you feel awake chant again the mahamantra:
hoo-hoo-hoo for ten minutes,</p><p>and then begin the day with a hearty laugh. Four: remember always
that I am with you. 333</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>EVERYTHING BELONGS TO THE MAN WHO WANTS NOTHING.</p><p><br></p><p>Having nothing, he possesses all things in life: renouncing all he
becomes the master of all. But why?</p><p>Because into his emptiness enters the divine. 334</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Live humbly and in wonder</p><p><br></p><p>and then meditation comes of itself. Relax, and there is ecstasy.</p><p>But effort is needed</p><p><br></p><p>because unless this fails completely you will not be effortless!</p><p>335</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p>Be aware or the mind BEFORE it is stirred by a thought, or, be aware
of the gap between two thoughts,</p><p>and – you will meet yourself!</p><p><br></p><p>And this meeting is the meeting with the divine. 336</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha says: If the mind does not arise all things are blameless.</p><p>What more is there to be said:</p><p><br></p><p>And even this much is enough to blame everything! 337</p><p>LOVE.</p><p><br></p><p>The eyes are blind. One must look within the heart. So do not believe
the eyes,</p><p>believe the heart</p><p><br></p><p>and remember to look through it,</p><p><br></p><p>and then you will come to know things unbelievable. And unless one
comes to know the unbelievable one has not known at all.</p><p>338</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember always the one who is inside the body. Walking, sitting,
eating or doing anything, remember the one who is neither walking nor
sitting</p><p>nor eating.</p><p><br></p><p>All doing is on the surface</p><p><br></p><p>and beyond all doing is the being;</p><p><br></p><p>so be aware of the nondoer in the doing. of the nonmover in the
moving.</p><p>One day Mulla Nasrudin’s wife, hearing a tremendous thump. ran to his
room.</p><p>Nothing to worry about, said the Mulla.</p><p><br></p><p>It was only my cloak which fell to the ground. What! And made a noise
like that? asked his wife Yes – I was inside it at the time, said the
Mulla.</p><p>339</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>A monk asked Daishu Ekai, What is nirvana? The Master answered: Not
to commit oneself to the vicious circle of birth and death or pleasure
and pain</p><p>is great nirvana,</p><p><br></p><p>What then is the vicious circle</p><p><br></p><p>of birth and death and pleasure and pain? The Master said:</p><p>To desire nirvana!</p><p><br></p><p>Now be silent and feel what is meant by to desire nirvana,</p><p>and remember that I am not saying think about it because to think is
to miss it.</p><p>FEEL IT. FEEL IT. FEEL IT. 340</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>In this world everything is upside down and anyone who is
meditating</p><p>will have to put everything right side up!</p><p><br></p><p>One should not try to know life but to know death, and then the
mysteries of life are revealed to him.</p><p>One should not ask for any security and then there is no insecurity
at all. Bunan says in a poem:</p><p>While living</p><p><br></p><p>be a dead man, be thoroughly dead and then behave as you like because
then all is well</p><p>341</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Materialistic societies produce hollow men, men with dead emptiness
within,</p><p>and because of this dead emptiness</p><p>one dies before one is really born.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember that man cannot live by shops alone, and today the holy of
holies is the shop.</p><p>The outer is meaningless without the inner richness and the outer
richness</p><p>only makes the inner poverty prominent.</p><p><br></p><p>Man is hollow because there is no inner growth</p><p><br></p><p>and the inner grows only when one lives in the inner. Inward is the
way of growth, grace and God.</p><p>342</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Never suppress any thought, or fight with it.</p><p>otherwise you will never be without it. Fight it, and you invite it
more.</p><p>Suppress it, and it will be back with double force.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard</p><p><br></p><p>that someone advertised something for women but with the heading,
ONLY FOR MEN,</p><p>and it is reported that</p><p><br></p><p>out of ninety thousand women who came across it eighty-nine thousand
nine hundred and ninety-four read the advertisement.</p><p>The other six were blind.</p><p>343</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>It is impossible to conceive of the divine intellectually, and that
is why the intellect denies it</p><p>or fabricates fictitious systems about it,</p><p><br></p><p>which is even more dangerous than plain denial. The mind works only
in the circle of the known; it cannot transcend the world of the
known:</p><p>for the mind the unknown is not.</p><p><br></p><p>Says Attar: You know nothing of your real self here and in this
state.</p><p>You are like the wax in the honeycomb – what does it know of fire or
guttering?</p><p>But when it gets to the stage of the waxen candle and when light is
emitted</p><p>THEN IT KNOWS. 344</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Life is not a detective story,</p><p><br></p><p>and you do not have to deduce a thing. Life is before your eyes as
clear as the sun and as open as the sky.</p><p>Just be out of your thinking, disease and open your eyes</p><p>and nothing is hidden at all.</p><p><br></p><p>Even the hidden one is not hidden then.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard a dialogue between Sherlock Holmes and Watson:</p><p>Holmes: Ah Watson. I see you have put on your winter underwear.</p><p>Watson: Marvellous, Holmes, marvellous! How did you ever deduce
that?</p><p>Holmes: Well, you have forgotten to put on your trousers.</p><p>345</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Life goes on flowing.</p><p><br></p><p>It does not wait.</p><p><br></p><p>But mind thinks and therefore takes time. To exist, no time is
needed,</p><p>but to think – time is necessary Really there is no time
existence.</p><p>it appears only because of the mind and its thinking</p><p>Existence exists not in time but in eternity. It exists in the
eternal now.</p><p>There is neither past nor future But only the present –</p><p>or not even that</p><p><br></p><p>because without the past and future it is meaningless to call it
present Do not live out or the mind.</p><p>otherwise you will always lag behind.</p><p><br></p><p>because life never waits for you and your so-called mind</p><p><br></p><p>that is why the mind always feels as if something is missing –
because it is missing life itself – and always!</p><p>Once a Master said to his disciples:</p><p><br></p><p>If you utter a word – thirty blows of my stick for you, but if you
utter no words</p><p>just the same, thirty blows of my stick Now – SPEAK. SPEAK!</p><p>One disciple came forward</p><p><br></p><p>and when he was about to bow before the Master he was struck</p><p>The disciple protested :I have not uttered a single word and neither
did you allow me not to utter.</p><p>Why the striking ?</p><p><br></p><p>The Master laughed and said</p><p><br></p><p>If I wait for you and your speech or your silence... it is too late
and life cannot wait!</p><p>346</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p>Goethe is said to have cried when dying:</p><p><br></p><p>Light, light, more light!</p><p><br></p><p>And Miguel Unamuno has responded with his:</p><p><br></p><p>No – warmth, warmth, more warmth! For we die of cold and not of
darkness!</p><p>But I say to you that we die neither because of cold nor because of
darkness</p><p>but because of our lust for living or because of our fear of death
–</p><p>which is to say the same thing in different terms.</p><p><br></p><p>Do not look at death as opposite to life, because it is not. And live
death moment to moment,</p><p>do not postpone it for the end because that creates fear.</p><p>Die each moment to the past,</p><p><br></p><p>and then each moment you will be fresh, young and reborn.</p><p><br></p><p>And then there is light always</p><p><br></p><p>because the very darkness becomes light, and warmth also,</p><p>because only the dead past is cold. THE PRESENT IS ALWAYS WARM.
347</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Man is not the end</p><p>but only the means</p><p><br></p><p>Man is not really a being but only a tension</p><p>between two planes of being. Man is a bridge only,</p><p>that is why man cannot remain satisfied with himself. His heart is
nothing but a continent of discontent and his very being is anguish.</p><p>Religion is the wish to pass beyond himself as he now is. That is why
I say man can never be irreligious;</p><p>that is impossible;</p><p><br></p><p>he can pretend to be but he cannot be.</p><p><br></p><p>Religion is not something accidental or circumstantial, it is in the
very nature of man.</p><p>Man is a religious animal</p><p><br></p><p>and man is nothing if man is not a desire to transcend himself.</p><p>He can go below himself, or he can go above</p><p>but he cannot remain himself. He cannot be rest.</p><p>That is why there is restlessness 348</p><p>Love.</p><p>Use dreaming consciously as meditation</p><p><br></p><p>and know well that conscious dreaming opens new doors of
perception.</p><p>Lie down, relax;</p><p><br></p><p>and dream but do not fall asleep; remain conscious in the background;
wait and watch;</p><p>dream anything that happens to your mind: do not plan beforehand;</p><p>dream anything because in dream the whole world is yours; dream your
existence as you please;</p><p>dream and be content,</p><p><br></p><p>content with your dreams because they are yours,</p><p><br></p><p>and remember that nothing can be yours like your dreams because you
yourself are a dream entity! –</p><p>and also because your wishes come to be true in your dreams, and only
in your dreams.</p><p>But do not fall into identification. Be a witness.</p><p>Remain aware.</p><p><br></p><p>And then suddenly there will be no dreaming.</p><p><br></p><p>Only you</p><p><br></p><p>and illumination.</p><p>349</p><p><br></p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>You write me that without me you cannot pass through the gate</p><p>and with me you will not pass through the gate. Oh, I know that!</p><p>But you need not do either.</p><p><br></p><p>You need not pass through the gate with me or not with me,</p><p>because I am the gate.</p><p><br></p><p>I am no-one, so how can you be with me or not with me?</p><p>And only one who is no-one can be the gate.</p><p><br></p><p>The gate means the emptiness</p><p><br></p><p>because the gate is nothing but the space to pass through.</p><p>Pass through me – not with me –</p><p>and know.</p><p><br></p><p>I appear to be someone only from without,</p><p><br></p><p>but the deeper you penetrate me the less you will find me.</p><p>And in the end – NO-ONE. 350</p><p>Love.</p><p><br></p><p>Walk as if you are not walking, stand as if you are not standing, sit
as if you are not sitting –</p><p>and then</p><p><br></p><p>you will begin to feel something completely new arising within
you.</p><p>This is the real one.</p><p><br></p><p>The false you walks, stands and sits</p><p><br></p><p>and the real you just remains in suchness. FEEL THIS – THIS VERY
MOMENT,</p><p>because there is no need to postpone it,</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=_index>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a></p><p>  </p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://osho.lol/posts/202_jokes_of_mulla_nasrudin/part1/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>1</span>

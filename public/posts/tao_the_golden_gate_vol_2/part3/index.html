THE VOID HAVING VANISHED INTO NOTHINGNESS, HE REALIZES THAT THE NOTHINGNESS OF NOTHING IS ALSO NOTHING, AND WHEN THE NETHERMOST NOTHINGNESS IS REACHED, THERE IS MOST TRULY TO BE FOUND A DEEP AND UNCHANGING STILLNESS.\nIN THIS PROFOUND STILLNESS HOW CAN DESIRES BE BEGOTTEN? WHEN DESIRES ARE NO LONGER BEGOTTEN, THEN THERE IS ESSENTIAL AND UNCHANGING STILLNESS.\nTRUTH IS ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGING.\nALL THINGS IN HEAVEN AND EARTH ARE IN ESSENCE UNCHANGING.\nThe East has respected the Master tremendously. The West is absolutely unaware of the phenomenon of the Masters. It knows the teachers, it is perfectly aware about the teachers, but not about the Masters. Even people write about jesus as a great teacher – western scholars write about Buddha as a great teacher – not knowing the difference. The difference is immense; the difference is so immense that it is unbridgeable. The Master is a totally different world.\nThe teacher is part of the ordinary, day-to-day existence. He knows more than you know: the difference is of quantity, not of quality. You can know more by just a little more effort. The teacher\nis just a little ahead of you as far as learning, knowledge, information, is concerned, but his being is the same as yours.\nThe Master may not know more than you, he may not know even that much as you know, but he IS more – he has more being. The difference is of quality: he exists on a different plane. He has entered a totally different dimension of which you are completely oblivious. He knows only one thing, that is his own inner being. And that knowing cannot be called knowledge for the simple reason because knowledge needs three things: the knower, the known and between the two exists the knowledge. The relationship between knower and the known: that is knowledge. But when you know yourself; the knower is the known, the knower is the knowledge; there is no distinction at all. There is no subject and no object. There is unity, not division.\nThe Master is one who has become united in the fundamental sense of ultimate consciousness. He is simply conscious. This consciousness gives him a totally different world view; with this consciousness everything else changes. He sees things in a new light, his eyes are unclouded. He has clarity, he is transparent, he is a pure mirror, crystal clear – not even a thought moves in his consciousness. Hence there is no more any veil, no more any obstruction.\nThe teacher is so full of thoughts that he is just the opposite end of the Master. Never call Buddha a teacher or Jesus a teacher or Lao Tzu a teacher – they are Masters. Moreover, they don’t teach at all – why call them teachers? They don’t impart any new knowledge to the world. Albert Einstein can be called a great teacher, Newton can be called a great teacher. Darwin can be called a great teacher, Marx, Freud – these people can be called great teachers: they have taught many things. What Lao Tzu has taught? What Buddha has taught? What Zarathustra has taught? Nothing at all! But they have imparted a new vision, a new style of life. They have touched people’s heart, and they have transformed those hearts. They don’t give you information, they give you transformation. What they say is not important, what they are is important. What they say is only a device; their silence is important.\nIf you want to understand Buddha, Lao Tzu, Ko Hsuan, Kabir, Nanak, you will have to learn how to read between the lines. You will have to learn how to understand silence and the music of silence. You will have to be silent. It is a totally different kind of learning – in fact, it is un learning. Whatsoever you know you will have to drop. You will have to drop all your beliefs, ideologies, philosophies. All that has been given to you by your teachers from the kg to the university level, you will have to get rid of it, you will have to transcend it. You will have to transcend all your teachers, only then you will be able to understand a Master. A Master is against all teachers.\nThe East has not respected teachers; its total respect goes to the Masters. The teachers are utilitarian; they are experts. If something goes wrong in your bathroom you call the plumber. He knows more than you as far as plumbing is concerned, but that is no reason to pay him great respect and call him “venerable”. Something goes wrong with your body, you call the doctor. He is another kind of plumber: he fixes your body. If you want to learn mathematics you go to a teacher.\nYou go to a Master only when you are tired of all this utilitarian existence. When you have come to see that there is something more, when you have felt a deep urge, a great longing, to know that which is non-utilitarian, which has intrinsic value, which can neither be sold nor purchased, which has no price but immense value, when you have come to feel the existence of the mysterious, of the miraculous, then only you are capable of contacting a Master.\nIn fact, the ancient Egyptian scriptures say: When the disciple is ready the Master appears himself. And when the disciple is ready? When he is tired of the utilitarian world. In the world everything has a utility; but God has no utility, truth has no utility, love has no utility, bliss has no utility, beauty has no utility. What is the utility of a rose Flower? An atom bomb has utility, a sword has utility. What is the utility of a beautiful sunset? There is no utility in it. Only when you start feeling the longing for the non-utilitarian you are capable of being with a Master; otherwise you will go on moving from one teacher to another teacher.\nTo be with a Master needs tremendous preparation. And the greatest thing required is the longing for the unknown, the longing for that which is not of this world. The longing seems to be almost mad to those who are concerned with money, power, prestige. They will think you have gone crazy if you become interested in meditation, if you become interested in silence. if you become interested in a Master. But the East has paid tremendous respect to the Masters.\nKo Hsuan starts each sutra with these beautiful words:\nTHE VENERABLE MASTER SAID...\nHe does not mention the name of the Master. In fact, names are of no use as far as a Master is concerned because a single Master represents all the Masters of the past, of the present, and of the future, too, because the taste of a Master is the same. Whether you come close to a Buddha or to a Mahavira or to a Moses or to Mohammed, it makes no difference. You will have the same taste, the same ecstasy, the same perfume. The same joy will pervade you; the same dance will start happening in your heart.\nBuddha has said again and again that you can taste the sea from anywhere: you will always find it salty. So are the Masters – names are irrelevant.\nKo Hsuan does not mention the name of the Master – names are utilitarian. A Master represents the ultimate, the nameless. He is the spokesman of the nameless experience – let him also be nameless. That is his message.\nTHE VENERABLE MASTER SAID...\nRemember few things before we enter into the sutra. Why the East respects the Master and not the teacher? Why the Master and not the scholar? Why the Master and not the pundit? Because the East has known that the pundit is only a parrot: he repeats what others have known; he has not experienced it himself. And because he has not experienced it himself it has no validity. He may be able to argue well, he may be able to convince you, he may be able to masquerade many proofs for what he is saying, but still what he is saying is borrowed; it has no roots in his own being. He is only talking to you from his memory, not from his consciousness.\nAnd truth is not in the scriptures. Truth is your very center of being, it is your essential core. You can become very clever with words – it is not difficult either – but those words are impotent, those words are empty, those words really don’t have any meaning. Meaning comes through experience.\nWhen Jesus says something it has meaning. You can repeat the same words; it cannot have the same meaning because your experience is not of that level, of that plane. You will put your own\nmeaning into it, you will pour your own experience into it. You will use Jesus’ words as containers, but the content will be yours. The bottle will be Jesus’, but the wine will be yours.\nAnd what have you got? You know nothing of importance. All that you know is simply rubbish – maybe useful in the world, maybe even necessarily needed in the world for a livelihood, but you don’t know what life is. You know how to earn money and you know only how to waste life.\nThere was an old professor of Darjeeling Who traveled from London to Ealing.\nIt said on the door,\n“Please don’t spit on the floor,”\nSo he carefully spat on the ceiling.\n“That philosopher really suffers for his beliefs,” said Mulla Nasruddin one day to me. “Why, what does he believe?” I asked him.\n“That he can wear a size 8 shoe on a size 11 foot!”\nAll your beliefs are like that. You are wearing clothes which were perfectly good for a Buddha but are not good for you. You are wearing shoes which were perfectly good for Lao Tzu but are not good for you. You are living in houses made by others for a totally different purpose, which is not your purpose. Your whole life is a long, long misery for the simple reason that if you have a size 11 foot and you are wearing size 8 shoes, whatsoever you believe, your belief is not going to help; it will create misery for you.\nLook at people’s lives – no joy, no song, no celebration. And these are Christians: they believe in Christ. And these are Hindus: they believe in Krishna. And these are Buddhists: they believe in Buddha. Something very fundamental has gone wrong. They may say they believe in Buddha, but only the words can be of Buddha. Who is going to put the meaning in those words? You will put your own meaning – and unless your experience changes, your meaning is going to remain very ordinary.\nA man and his son are driving in a taxi with a great scholar in Paris near Place de la Madeleine. They pass through a street full of prostitutes standing on the sidewalk. The taxi is almost stopped by the traffic.\n“Daddy, Daddy, what are all these women doing standing there?”\n“Well... hmm... these women must he waiting for their husbands. You see, it is six o’clock and offices are closing.”\n“Don’t listen to your father! These are whores!” says the scholar who is a great believer of straight- forwardness with children.\n“Daddy, what are whores?”\n“Well,... hmm... you see... it means they have more than one husband.” “You mean like movie actresses?”\n“Yes, but more – lots, hundreds, thousands of husbands!”\n“Gee! But all these thousands husbands... then they must have lots of children too!” “It is quite rare, but it happens, of course.”\n“And these children, Daddy, what do they become?” “They become... scholars!”\nThe East has never paid any respect to the scholars. They are intellectual laborers, they are not real intelligentsia – the West has always misunderstood them for real intelligentsia. They are intellectuals, but they are not intelligent people. Sometimes you will find the so-called intellectuals more stupid than the farmers and the gardeners and the fishermen, for the simple reason because the farmers and the gardeners and the fishermen and the carpenters, they live close to nature, to life, to existence. They have a far truer experience, far closer, intimate contact with reality than your so-called professors, pundits and scholars. They live surrounded with words – big words, bombastic words – but they live in prisons of words. You can be very easily deceived by them because they talk in the same way as the Masters. They are pseudo, they are pretenders. Beware of it and beware of their stupidity.\nAn Englishman is walking up a mountain when he sees a famous professor of philosophy passing in a car, driving backwards up the hill.\n“Hey, professor!” the surprised Englishman calls out. “What are you doing?”\n“Well,” the professor answers, “I have to deliver a package up the mountain and I was told it was impossible to turn around up there.”\nAfter this both continued their trip up the hill. Fifteen minutes later the Englishman sees the car coming down the hill backwards again.\n“Hey, professor, stop!” he says, “What is the matter?”\n“Oh!” the professor replies smiling. “I was wrong – I could turn anyway!”\nThe Master is one who lives the truth. Not that he knows about it, not that he has heard about it, not that he philosophizes about it, but he lives it, he knows it – he has become truth itself. His being is his teaching; everything else is just a device to bring awakening to the sleeping ones. If he uses words it is not to convey the truth, he uses words like alarm clocks to wake you. The teacher uses the words to convey truth. And truth can never be conveyed by words. The Master also uses\nthe words, but never to convey the truth. He knows perfectly well truth cannot be conveyed; it is untransferable. It cannot be communicated by any means, but YOU can be awakened to it.\nThe real thing is not to tell you the truth; the real thing is to make you aware. The moment you are aware you know the truth because truth is already within you. It is not something that comes from the outside; it is something that is asleep within you and has to be awakened.\nThe Master uses words and because he uses words, scholars go on repeating the same words for centuries, thinking that they are important words, very important words. They must be containing truth because Buddha used them, Ko Hsuan used them, Bodhidharma used them, Rinzai used them, Bahauddin used them. Such great Masters have used them – those words must contain something of immense value. They contain nothing. They were used for a totally different purpose. The purpose was to awaken the sleeping ones.\nBrigitte Bardot was given a parrot as a gift and she put it in her bedroom. Every night she would bring a new lover to her bed and from his cage the parrot would encourage all her love-making with words like, “Go on! Go on! You are coming!”\nAfter a few days Brigitte Bardot got rather annoyed with him and when one morning, while she was walking around naked, the parrot shouted, “Come here, beloved, I want to make love to you!” she got infuriated and beat the parrot up.\nWhile smoothing his feathers the parrot sadly said, “But you did not treat the other cocks like this!”\nThe pundit is a parrot. He thinks Buddha influenced millions of people by these words, Krishna transformed thousands of people by these words, Bhagavad Gita, and Mohammed has inspired thousands of souls for centuries by Koran and the words that it contains – these words must be of great potential. So he goes on repeating those words. But those words contain nothing. He is simply imitating a device not knowing the exact purpose of it.\nA corporal is instructing his platoon. He calls a newly-arrived soldier and asks him, “You, Gino! What is the flag for you?”\n“The flag,” answers the soldier, “is a piece of cloth of different colors.”\n“What! What are you saying? You idiot! The flag is everything. The flag is your mother, remember, your mother!”\nThen he turns to the next soldier and asks, “Tell me what is a flag?” “Gino’s mother,” replies the soldier.\nBeware of the scholars; they are the most stupid people around. But they talk beautifully, and if you are not alert you can be very easily deceived by them. They recite Koran, they recite Bhagavad Gita, they quote the Vedas, the Upanishads, they comment and they interpret, and in a very logical way, in a convincing way – it will appeal to your mind. But, in fact, Buddha never wanted to appeal to your mind, neither Krishna wanted to appeal to your mind. They wanted to help you to go beyond\nthe mind. They were not to convince your mind, because if you are convinced about a certain idea you will remain IN the mind. They were trying to unhinge you from the mind.\nCan you see the totally different purpose? The purpose of a Master is to push you beyond the boundaries of the mind, and the purpose of the scholar is to convince you intellectually about the rightness, about the validity of a certain ideology, philosophy. He makes your mind more strengthened, he gives you more mind. The Master takes away your mind, the Master destroys your mind. The teacher nourishes your mind. So many times the teacher will look more appealing to you, more convincing to you.\nYou can miss the Master very easily because he will seem a dangerous person to be around. A teacher seems to be very fulfilling; he enhances your ego. It is not accidental that the West has respected the teacher because the West has believed for thousands of years that the ego has to be strengthened, that a strong ego is needed; without a strong ego a man has no personality. It is true: without a strong ego a man has no personality; but ego is false, so is personality.\nThe word “personality” comes from a Greek word PERSONA; PERSONA means a mask. In ancient days Greek actors used masks. Those PERSONAS, masks, we are all carrying. A strong ego certainly gives you a strong personality in the original sense of the word, but the personality is not individuality and the ego is not your soul – just the contrary.\nThe Master destroys your personality so that your individuality can be discovered. He dismantles your personality, he takes away all your masks, so that you can know your original face. His work is difficult and only very courageous people can be with him because it is surgical. Your mask has become almost part of your existence; to take it away now needs surgery. It is not easy to take it away, it is painful. Only a Master is needed to take it away. Slowly slowly, chunk by chunk, he goes on taking away your mask. Finally, when the mask has completely disappeared, you discover your reality, your original face.\nThe teacher gives you to think much; the Master only gives you a meditativeness. The teacher gives you much to dream about, to desire about; the Master hammers on all your dreams and destroys them. The Master is against your sleep; the teacher is a sedative, a tranquilizer. The Master is not a solace, is not a consolation, is not a tranquilizer. The Master hurts, wounds, but he transforms.\nA man finds himself in purgatory. The angel-in-charge welcomes him in.\n“Not your turn today,” says the angel. “You still have more time to pass on earth. Come with me.”\nThe angel takes him to a huge room full of small bottles full of oil. “These show how much life you have left,” says the angel. His bottle is almost empty.\n“Can I see my wife’s and children’s bottles?” he asks.\n“Sure,” says the angel, pointing to the three bottles next to his. The man cannot believe his eyes. For the children, the quantity seems normal, but his wife seems to have an extraordinary large quantity in her bottle.\nLeft alone and thinking, as the angel is working with newcomers, he delicately sticks his finger in his wife’s bottle, takes a little oil and puts it in his own one. He keeps on doing this until the two bottles are more or less even. He wants to go on, but is suddenly awakened by a big slap and his wife’s voice saying, “You dirty old man, always wandering fingers, even when I sleep!”\nMan is deep asleep, dreaming, desiring, of hell, of heaven, of thousand-and-one things. The function of the Master is to hit you so hard that you cannot avoid waking up.\nKo Hsuan says:\nTHE VENERABLE MASTER SAID:\nWHEN HE HAS CLEARLY THOUGHT ABOUT THESE THREE HE PERCEIVES ONLY A VOID, BUT WHEN HE CONTEMPLATES THE VOID, HE REALIZES THAT THE VOID IS ALSO VOID AND HAS BECOME NOTHINGNESS.\nThis is a very significant sutra, but first few words have to be put right. The translation is done by a scholar and that too by a western scholar. He says:\nWHEN HE HAS CLEARLY THOUGHT...\nNow the original cannot mean that he has “clearly thought”, because clarity and thought cannot exist together. That’s impossible; their coexistence is impossible. If there is clarity there is no thought; if there is thinking there is no clarity. It is like saying, “The sky was full of clouds and very clear. The sky was full of clouds and it was very sunny.” It is impossible. Either it is sunny and the sky is clear, then there are no clouds... If there are clouds, and many clouds, then the sun will be hiding behind the clouds and there can be no clear sky. You cannot see the sky because of the clouds.\nClarity is a byproduct of meditativeness, not of thought. But this is what is going to happen when scholars do these things. In their own way they are doing a great service, without knowing real differences. And one cannot expect that they will be able to know – they have not experienced clarity. They have thought about it, but to think about clarity is one thing; to know clarity is a totally different thing.\nI know clarity, but in clarity there is no thought at all. And I have known thoughts: when there are thoughts there is no clarity. Hence, read this sentence in a little different way:\nWHEN HE HAS CLEARLY meditated THESE THREE things HE PERCEIVES ONLY A VOID...\nIn the last sutra we talk-d about the three things: sexuality... In India it is called KAMMA; it is the source of all desires. Remember it: sexuality is not only the source of sex, it is the source of ALL desires. Hence you can change your desires, you can forget about sex completely, but if desires persist it is still sexuality. And you can watch it...\nThere are people who are obsessed with money. You can see one thing: they are no more interested in sex; their whole interest has moved into money. But now money has become their sex object.\nWhen they touch money they touch as if they are touching their beloved. I have seen people touching hundred-rupee notes with such tenderness – unbelievable.\nI used to know one person whose only joy was money, even somebody else’s money. Just if you are interested in beautiful women it does not matter whose wife it is. If a beautiful woman passes by you become immediately interested; a great desire arises in you. Civilization prevents you; the police is there, the law is there, so you don’t do anything, you don’t act – that is one thing – but the thought starts fantasizing. The mind starts spinning, weaving dreams.\nThe same was true about this man. He was a relative of mine. Somebody else’s money... if he will see that you have many notes in your pocket he will just take the money out, will count it, with such tenderness – and it is not his money either! He will give it back to you, but when he will give you can see the sadness arising in his eyes, you can see the unwillingness.\nHe was always asking for money, and he had enough money. He was always borrowing money from others.\nI used to ask him, “You have money – why you go on borrowing?”\nAnd slowly slowly he became very honest with me and he said, “I cannot use my own money in any way. It hurts to bring the money out of my own pocket – it hurts. I feel almost paralyzed! I can borrow it from somebody?”\nAnd he never used to give back. He was well known all over the city, that once he takes money from you he will never give back – he cannot. Everybody used to feel pity for him. He had ten bungalows, but he himself used to live in a very small room, in one of his bungalows’ servant quarters. He could have afforded a beautiful car, but he used to move on a bicycle so ancient and old that I have never seen anything older than that bicycle.\nAnd I told him, “At least you can purchase a new bicycle!”\nHe said, “But this bicycle has served me for so long. Moreover, it is a gift from my father. Now my father is dead and this reminds me of my father always. And one thing is very good about this bicycle – nobody else can ride on it!”\nIt was really difficult to ride on it; only he was expert on riding on it. It had only the very absolutely essential things in it – no chain cover, no mudguards, no horn, nothing, no brakes – and it used to make noise at least from half a mile away. And he will put it anywhere. He said, “Nobody ever steals it. Who will steal it?” – the whole city knew whose bicycle it is – “You will be caught immediately. And wherever you will move the whole neighborhood will know that whose bicycle it is.”\nHe will go into the movie house, but he will not put the bicycle on the stand because there you have to pay ten paise or twenty paise or something. He will put it anywhere outside the movie house and he will always find his bicycle in its place, he never lost it. To the very last day of his life he was using his bicycle.\nHe lived a poor man’s life, a very poor man’s life – the life of a beggar. And he collected so much money... He had no son, no daughter.\nIt almost always happens that miserly people don’t have children; there must be some psychological reason in it. In India the very miserly people have always to adopt children – rich people they are. Poor people have many children, too many, in fact; they need birth control And the rich people, the very rich, the miserly people, don’t have children. They are so miserly that something deep happens even to their chemistry. Their whole sexuality becomes obsessed with money.\nHence, remember, the first poison Ko Hsuan calls sexuality. It does not mean only sex, it means all desires.\nA Scotsman arrives at the toll gate of a bridge, gives a penny to the attendant, and walks on. “Hey, young man!” shouts the attendant. “The toll is two pennies!”\n“I know, I know,” replies the young man in a tired voice, “but I will only go half way and then I will jump!”\nCoroner: “What were your husband’s last words, Mrs. Boccafucci?”\nMrs. Boccafucci: “Emilio said, ‘I don’t see how they can make a profit on this chianti at a dollar a gallon.’”\nLast words! Last words are always very important; they are the essence of your whole life. There are people who even at the very end of their life are thinking of money.\nWhen God created Switzerland he asked a Swiss, “What do you want?” Without hesitation the Swiss replied, “I want a lot of milk!”\nAnd so it was.\nAfter a few days god, curious, asked the Swiss, “Is your milk good?” The best, my Lord,” replied the Swiss. “Try some!”\nGod tasted it and found it really good. then he asked the Swiss, “Do you want something else?” Again, without hesitation, the Swiss replied, “Yes, my Lord. Four francs for the milk you drank!”\nEven if you come across God, if you are obsessed with money you won’t see God at all; you will do the thing that you have been doing your whole life. You will not change just by seeing God – nothing can change you unless you drop the poison yourself. And this happens only when a person becomes really meditative, when all thoughts disappear and he has a clarity to see, when he becomes a seer.\nThe first poison is sexuality. And when you are thinking in terms of sexuality, whatsoever form your sexuality has taken – it may have become money obsession, it may have become power obsession, it does not matter – when you are thinking in terms of sexuality, everything deep inside you becomes sexual. Your whole life functions as a transforming mechanism for everything, to create more and\nmore sexuality. Whatsoever you see, you see your own sexuality projected – you can’t see anything else. You lose all clarity. You become surrounded by your own inner poison; it goes on rising like smoke around you and you can see only through the smoke, and the smoke distorts everything that you see.\nA black private and a white sergeant were getting ready to go on leave, when, at the last minute, orders came that the private’s leave was canceled. The black man said to the white, “Sergeant, would you please tell my girlfriend what happened so she won’t think I ran off with another lady? She will believe you because you are my sergeant.”\nThe sergeant agreed and took the address. When he arrived in town he looked up the house number and it turned out to be a whorehouse in the red light district of town. He went up to the house and knocked on the door.\nA large, black madam opened the door. She looked at the sergeant and said, “I am awfully sorry, sergeant, but we do not serve white men here, only black men.”\nThe sergeant answered, “You don’t understand, madam! You see, I have got this black private...” The madam smiled and said, “Well, ain’t you the fancy one”\nThe second poison, anger, arises whenever your sexuality is prevented. Anything that comes as an obstruction to your desires creates anger. You cannot drop anger unless desires disappear.\nMany people have asked me how to drop anger, and they6 don’t understand that they are talking of dropping a symptom. anger is only a symptom. It simply says somewhere your desire has been obstructed: something is coming between you, your desire, and the object of your desire – hence the anger. anger means, “I will destroy the obstruction!” You cannot drop anger unless your sexuality disappears.\nIt is not accidental that husbands and wives continuously quarrel and are angry with each other, for the simple reason... the sexuality. They are each other’s sexual object, and wherever there is sexuality there is anger. Anger is like smoke. Logicians say, “Wherever there is smoke there is fire.” You can say, “Wherever there is anger there is sexuality”. When anger disappears, that means sexuality has disappeared.\nThe disappearance of anger happens only, is possible only, when the root is no more there. You cannot drop your anger; you will have to go to the very roots. Trying to drop your anger will only create new kinds of anger: you will repress it from one side, it will come from another side.\nIt is because of this well known fact that for centuries no country has allowed its army people to have free sexuality, because if soldiers are allowed to have freedom about their sexuality, if their sex is not obstructed, then they lose destructiveness, then they lose anger, then they are no more angry.\nTheir sex has to be obstructed in many ways. They have to be deprived of their wives, they have to be kept away from their wives. Not only that: they have to he allowed to see all kinds of pornographic films, all kinds of pornographic magazines; they have to he allowed to come in\ncontact with actresses. When two countries are at war, actresses go to meet and visit the soldiers to encourage them. And what is their encouragement? The encouragement is this: that when an actress comes, a Sophia Loren comes, all the soldiers become sexually aroused. of course, they cannot do anything about it; that aroused energy turns into anger, it becomes rage. Then they start destroying the enemy, then they are madly in destruction. If they are allowed to have their wives with them on the front, their girlfriends, then they will lose interest in war.\nThat is one of the reasons why Americans go on losing all wars: their soldiers are the least sexually repressed people; they are not going to win any war. Sexual repression is a must – it creates anger. And when there is so much anger and there is no other outlet, then the only possible outlet is destroy the enemy.\nAnd have you watched? Always it happens whenever an army conquers a country: the first victims are the women of that country; they are raped immediately. Cannot you see the relationship? Were the soldiers fighting for the women? Why immediately, the moment the soldiers enter a city as conquerors, they start raping around as if they were just waiting for the opportunity? There was no opportunity available; now it is available. The first thing is: rape the women. And the second thing is: rob people of their money. The first comes out of anger and the second comes out of greed, but the cause of both lies in the first. Repressed sex will create anger and greed.\nYou will be surprised to know that any religion that has been teaching to its followers some kind of repression has always helped its followers to become rich. In India, Jains have become very rich; they are the most repressive people. And something of significance has to he understood about their psychology. Their religion says: Repress sex; BRAHMACHARYA, celibacy is their goal. And second thing: Don’t he violent; so anger is not allowed. Sex is not allowed, anger is not allowed. Now where the energy is to go? Now only the third possibility is left – greed. So all the Jains have become the greediest persons in this country. They are a small community, very small community – in such a big, vast country they are nothing – but still they are very powerful because they have all the money. You will not come across a single Jain beggar; nothing like it exists. They are not poor people – they cannot be poor; their religion has made it absolutely certain for them that they will he rich. Sex has to he repressed and anger has to he repressed. Now only one outlet is left – greed. Become greedy.\nDo you know? The English word “love” comes from a Sanskrit root LOBHA. LOBHA means greed; it is greed for the other’s body. So whenever a person looks sexually at somebody else you can see the greed in his eyes: he wants to possess the other’s body. That’s why every civilization allows only a certain time limit to see; more than that is thought to he offensive. Somehow a subtle agreement has happened, a deep contract: three seconds are allowed. If you watch at a woman tor three seconds, no offense will he taken; it will be thought just casual. But if you watch more, then she will become annoyed. If you go on looking at her, then she will be angry; then you are behaving in an uncivilized way. You are looking at her body with greed to possess, to exploit, to use as a means. And. of course, nobody wants to be reduced into a means, into a thing, into a possession.\nThe English word “greed” also comes from a Sanskrit word, GRIDDHA; GRIDDHA means the vulture. The greedy person has a vulture-like quality, as if he wants to eat the other. And that kind of expression has come into many languages, particularly in French.\nI have heard:\nA ship wrecked, and a Frenchwoman swam to an island. She was absolutely naked; all her clothes had gone into the sea. But the beach was beautiful, and she was lying on the beach naked, taking a sunbath, thinking “What to do next?” – whether anybody lives on this island or not. There seemed to he no sign of anybody living...\nAnd then suddenly she heard a noise; somebody was coming, a very big man, almost like a huge gorilla. A very small tribe lived there. The tribe was of cannibals, hence very small, because cannibals cannot grow – they start eating each other. And the cannibal was very happy seeing a new food – so delicious she was looking!\nHe came, looked at her and said, “I would like to eat you!” And the Frenchwoman said, “Then what you are waiting for?”\nThe cannibal was puzzled. This was for the first time that somebody has said, “Why you are waiting? For what? Start!” – because in French “to eat” means “I want to make love to you.”\nLanguage gives great indications. In fact, when you look at a woman with greedy eyes you want to eat her – or a woman looks at a man... Ordinarily they don’t look because they have been taught for centuries not to look at the man; that has become their feminine grace. When somebody says to a woman, “I love you,” she looks downward – just to he certain whether he really means it or is just talking nonsense! She does not believe in words, she believes in the body, she believes in the physiology – and the body never lies.\nWhen one has come to deep meditation there is a clarity. In this clarity all the three poisons disappear without leaving a trace behind. And then he perceives only a void.\nThe first experience of meditation is that of a void, but remember it is a first experience, the first SATORI: one experiences void. But remember, the experience is still there; that’s why it is still the beginning, not the end. You experience the void, but the void EXPERIENCED itself becomes something; it is not nothing.\nThat’s why you will come across many Zen stories...\nThe disciple comes to the Master and says, “I have experienced nothing,” and the Master hits him and says, “So back and meditate again! You missed!”\n“But,” he says, “I have experienced nothing! And that’s what you were saying – that to experience nothing is what meditation is all about. And I have experienced it!”\nBut the Master still persists: “You go and meditate again – you missed.” Because if nothingness becomes also an experience, then it is something. You can experience only some thing. You have experienced nothingness, but once experienced it becomes an object, and there is a division: the knower and the known. Hence it is the first SATORI.\nKo Hsuan’s sutra is tremendously beautiful. He says:\n... HE PERCEIVES ONLY A VOID, BUT WHEN BE CONTEMPLATES THE VOID...\nbut when he goes deeper into meditation\n... HE REALIZES THAT THE VOID IS ALSO VOID AND HAS BECOME A NOTHINGNESS.\nAs he goes deeper, the second satori opens up. Going deeper, he disappears as an experiencer. First the object disappeared, the void was there; but because of the old habit the void became the object. Now the experiencer has also gone. Now there is only nothingness – nobody to experience, nothing to be experienced. This is the second SATORI.\nTHE VOID HAVING VANISHED INTO NOTHINGNESS, HE REALIZES THAT THIS NOTHINGNESS OF NOTHING IS ALSO NOTHING...\nThis is the last possibility of still getting hooked into an experience. You can start rejoicing, that “I have experienced nothing;” then you remain hooked with the first SATORI. You can start rejoicing, that “I have experienced that there is no experience and no experiencer. I have experienced that both are void.” It is better than the first, deeper than the first, but somehow the experiencer has still saved itself in a subtle way. It has moved a little deeper – now it says, “I have experienced that there is no experience and no experiencer.” You will be hooked in the second satori.\nThe third SATORI happens when:\n... HE REALIZES THAT THE NOTHINGNESS OF NOTHING IS ALSO NOTHING, AND WHEN THE NETHERMOST NOTHINGNESS IS REACHED...\nAnd this is the ultimate nothingness; then he does not claim at all. Now if you ask him, “What have you experienced?” he will smile. He cannot say, “I have experienced nothingness.” This is SAMADHI – the third SATORI, the ultimate flowering. Now there is nothing left, neither as an object nor as a subject nor as a transcendental subject which transcends both. Nothing is left. Buddha has called it ANATTA, no-self – a state of total nothingness, absolute nothingness. Hence, what can he said about it?\nWhenever anybody asked Buddha about his ultimate experience he will say, “Don’t ask absurd questions, ask practical questions. Ask how to reach it, don’t ask what has happened. It cannot he conveyed.”\nLao Tzu says: Truth said becomes a falsehood Truth unsaid remains true: uttered, becomes false. The Upanishads say: Those who say that “We know,” know not.\nSocrates in his last stage of life said. “I know only one thing, that I know nothing.” But Ko Hsuan will say even that is not right: that is second satori,. because he is still saying, “I know only one thing. that I know nothing.” Still the statement is there, still the knower is there. According to Ko Hsuan, at least, the statement is wrong. Socrates attained the ultimate SAMADHI, but Socrates is a Greek, he is not a Chinese – he speaks the way Greeks could have understood. He cannot speak in paradoxes, he speaks logically. Hence he says, I know only one thing, that I know nothing.”\nKo Hsuan will not even say that; Buddha will not say even that: Lao Tzu will not even say that.\nWHEN this NETHERMOST NOTHINGNESS IS REACHED, THERE IS MOST TRULY TO BE FOUND A DEEP AND UNCHANGING STILLNESS.\nNow for the first time a deep, unchanging stillness prevails. Eternity has opened its doors to you. Now there is no more falling hack. You have gone beyond the beyond. You have transcended even the transcendental.\nIN THIS PROFOUND STILLNESS HOW CAN DESIRES BE BEGOTTEN? WHEN DESIRES ARE NO LONGER BEGOTTEN, THEN THERE IS ESSENTIAL AND UNCHANGING STILLNESS.\nTRUTH IS ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGING.\nALL THINGS IN HEAVEN AND EARTH ARE IN ESSENCE UNCHANGING.\nSo whatsoever changes is only the appearance, what in India the mystics have called MAYA. It is only appearance.\nForms change; the essential truth remains the same. Waves change; the ocean remains the same forever. Once you have seen this you are no more in any misery because you are no more in any desire, no more in any dreams. Once you have experienced this you have become part of the organic whole. You have disappeared; you have become the very ocean. You are no more a wave, you are no more a dewdrop, you are oceanic.\nTo experience this oceanic vastness is the experience of Tao. And the secret is in meditation. And one has to pass through three stages: first satori, the experience of the void; second SATORI, the experience that the void is void; and the third SATORI... now nothing can be said anymore. Now all is silent and still, absolutely silent and still.\nThe Master is one who has reached to this third, one who has transcended the transcendental, one who has gone beyond the beyond Then he has the being of the whole. To be in tune with him is to be in tune with God, with Tao, with truth. To be in tune with him is to be in tune with bliss, with beauty, with benediction.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"7547","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/tao_the_golden_gate_vol_2/part3/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/tao_the_golden_gate_vol_2/>Tao.

TRULY TO BE FOUND A DEEP AND UNCHANGING STILLNESS.</p><p><br></p><p>IN THIS PROFOUND STILLNESS HOW CAN DESIRES BE BEGOTTEN? WHEN DESIRES
ARE NO LONGER BEGOTTEN, THEN THERE IS ESSENTIAL AND UNCHANGING
STILLNESS.</p><p><br></p><p>TRUTH IS ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGING.</p><p><br></p><p>ALL THINGS IN HEAVEN AND EARTH ARE IN ESSENCE UNCHANGING.</p><p><br></p><p>The East has respected the Master tremendously. The West is
absolutely unaware of the phenomenon of the Masters. It knows the
teachers, it is perfectly aware about the teachers, but not about the
Masters. Even people write about jesus as a great teacher – western
scholars write about Buddha as a great teacher – not knowing the
difference. The difference is immense; the difference is so immense that
it is unbridgeable. The Master is a totally different world.</p><p><br></p><p>The teacher is part of the ordinary, day-to-day existence. He knows
more than you know: the difference is of quantity, not of quality. You
can know more by just a little more effort. The teacher</p><p>is just a little ahead of you as far as learning, knowledge,
information, is concerned, but his being is the same as yours.</p><p><br></p><p>The Master may not know more than you, he may not know even that much
as you know, but he IS more – he has more being. The difference is of
quality: he exists on a different plane. He has entered a totally
different dimension of which you are completely oblivious. He knows only
one thing, that is his own inner being. And that knowing cannot be
called knowledge for the simple reason because knowledge needs three
things: the knower, the known and between the two exists the knowledge.
The relationship between knower and the known: that is knowledge. But
when you know yourself; the knower is the known, the knower is the
knowledge; there is no distinction at all. There is no subject and no
object. There is unity, not division.</p><p>The Master is one who has become united in the fundamental sense of
ultimate consciousness. He is simply conscious. This consciousness gives
him a totally different world view; with this consciousness everything
else changes. He sees things in a new light, his eyes are unclouded. He
has clarity, he is transparent, he is a pure mirror, crystal clear – not
even a thought moves in his consciousness. Hence there is no more any
veil, no more any obstruction.</p><p><br></p><p>The teacher is so full of thoughts that he is just the opposite end
of the Master. Never call Buddha a teacher or Jesus a teacher or Lao Tzu
a teacher – they are Masters. Moreover, they don’t teach at all – why
call them teachers? They don’t impart any new knowledge to the world.
Albert Einstein can be called a great teacher, Newton can be called a
great teacher. Darwin can be called a great teacher, Marx, Freud – these
people can be called great teachers: they have taught many things. What
Lao Tzu has taught? What Buddha has taught? What Zarathustra has taught?
Nothing at all! But they have imparted a new vision, a new style of
life. They have touched people’s heart, and they have transformed those
hearts. They don’t give you information, they give you transformation.
What they say is not important, what they are is important. What they
say is only a device; their silence is important.</p><p>If you want to understand Buddha, Lao Tzu, Ko Hsuan, Kabir, Nanak,
you will have to learn how to read between the lines. You will have to
learn how to understand silence and the music of silence. You will have
to be silent. It is a totally different kind of learning – in fact, it
is un learning. Whatsoever you know you will have to drop. You will have
to drop all your beliefs, ideologies, philosophies. All that has been
given to you by your teachers from the kg to the university level, you
will have to get rid of it, you will have to transcend it. You will have
to transcend all your teachers, only then you will be able to understand
a Master. A Master is against all teachers.</p><p><br></p><p>The East has not respected teachers; its total respect goes to the
Masters. The teachers are utilitarian; they are experts. If something
goes wrong in your bathroom you call the plumber. He knows more than you
as far as plumbing is concerned, but that is no reason to pay him great
respect and call him “venerable”. Something goes wrong with your body,
you call the doctor. He is another kind of plumber: he fixes your body.
If you want to learn mathematics you go to a teacher.</p><p><br></p><p>You go to a Master only when you are tired of all this utilitarian
existence. When you have come to see that there is something more, when
you have felt a deep urge, a great longing, to know that which is
non-utilitarian, which has intrinsic value, which can neither be sold
nor purchased, which has no price but immense value, when you have come
to feel the existence of the mysterious, of the miraculous, then only
you are capable of contacting a Master.</p><p>In fact, the ancient Egyptian scriptures say: When the disciple is
ready the Master appears himself. And when the disciple is ready? When
he is tired of the utilitarian world. In the world everything has a
utility; but God has no utility, truth has no utility, love has no
utility, bliss has no utility, beauty has no utility. What is the
utility of a rose Flower? An atom bomb has utility, a sword has utility.
What is the utility of a beautiful sunset? There is no utility in it.
Only when you start feeling the longing for the non-utilitarian you are
capable of being with a Master; otherwise you will go on moving from one
teacher to another teacher.</p><p><br></p><p>To be with a Master needs tremendous preparation. And the greatest
thing required is the longing for the unknown, the longing for that
which is not of this world. The longing seems to be almost mad to those
who are concerned with money, power, prestige. They will think you have
gone crazy if you become interested in meditation, if you become
interested in silence. if you become interested in a Master. But the
East has paid tremendous respect to the Masters.</p><p><br></p><p>Ko Hsuan starts each sutra with these beautiful words:</p><p><br></p><p>THE VENERABLE MASTER SAID...</p><p><br></p><p>He does not mention the name of the Master. In fact, names are of no
use as far as a Master is concerned because a single Master represents
all the Masters of the past, of the present, and of the future, too,
because the taste of a Master is the same. Whether you come close to a
Buddha or to a Mahavira or to a Moses or to Mohammed, it makes no
difference. You will have the same taste, the same ecstasy, the same
perfume. The same joy will pervade you; the same dance will start
happening in your heart.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha has said again and again that you can taste the sea from
anywhere: you will always find it salty. So are the Masters – names are
irrelevant.</p><p><br></p><p>Ko Hsuan does not mention the name of the Master – names are
utilitarian. A Master represents the ultimate, the nameless. He is the
spokesman of the nameless experience – let him also be nameless. That is
his message.</p><p><br></p><p>THE VENERABLE MASTER SAID...</p><p><br></p><p>Remember few things before we enter into the sutra. Why the East
respects the Master and not the teacher? Why the Master and not the
scholar? Why the Master and not the pundit? Because the East has known
that the pundit is only a parrot: he repeats what others have known; he
has not experienced it himself. And because he has not experienced it
himself it has no validity. He may be able to argue well, he may be able
to convince you, he may be able to masquerade many proofs for what he is
saying, but still what he is saying is borrowed; it has no roots in his
own being. He is only talking to you from his memory, not from his
consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>And truth is not in the scriptures. Truth is your very center of
being, it is your essential core. You can become very clever with words
– it is not difficult either – but those words are impotent, those words
are empty, those words really don’t have any meaning. Meaning comes
through experience.</p><p><br></p><p>When Jesus says something it has meaning. You can repeat the same
words; it cannot have the same meaning because your experience is not of
that level, of that plane. You will put your own</p><p>meaning into it, you will pour your own experience into it. You will
use Jesus’ words as containers, but the content will be yours. The
bottle will be Jesus’, but the wine will be yours.</p><p><br></p><p>And what have you got? You know nothing of importance. All that you
know is simply rubbish – maybe useful in the world, maybe even
necessarily needed in the world for a livelihood, but you don’t know
what life is. You know how to earn money and you know only how to waste
life.</p><p><br></p><p>There was an old professor of Darjeeling Who traveled from London to
Ealing.</p><p>It said on the door,</p><p><br></p><p>“Please don’t spit on the floor,”</p><p><br></p><p>So he carefully spat on the ceiling.</p><p><br></p><p>“That philosopher really suffers for his beliefs,” said Mulla
Nasruddin one day to me. “Why, what does he believe?” I asked him.</p><p>“That he can wear a size 8 shoe on a size 11 foot!”</p><p><br></p><p>All your beliefs are like that. You are wearing clothes which were
perfectly good for a Buddha but are not good for you. You are wearing
shoes which were perfectly good for Lao Tzu but are not good for you.
You are living in houses made by others for a totally different purpose,
which is not your purpose. Your whole life is a long, long misery for
the simple reason that if you have a size 11 foot and you are wearing
size 8 shoes, whatsoever you believe, your belief is not going to help;
it will create misery for you.</p><p><br></p><p>Look at people’s lives – no joy, no song, no celebration. And these
are Christians: they believe in Christ. And these are Hindus: they
believe in Krishna. And these are Buddhists: they believe in Buddha.
Something very fundamental has gone wrong. They may say they believe in
Buddha, but only the words can be of Buddha. Who is going to put the
meaning in those words? You will put your own meaning – and unless your
experience changes, your meaning is going to remain very ordinary.</p><p><br></p><p>A man and his son are driving in a taxi with a great scholar in Paris
near Place de la Madeleine. They pass through a street full of
prostitutes standing on the sidewalk. The taxi is almost stopped by the
traffic.</p><p><br></p><p>“Daddy, Daddy, what are all these women doing standing there?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well... hmm... these women must he waiting for their husbands. You
see, it is six o’clock and offices are closing.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Don’t listen to your father! These are whores!” says the scholar who
is a great believer of straight- forwardness with children.</p><p>“Daddy, what are whores?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well,... hmm... you see... it means they have more than one
husband.” “You mean like movie actresses?”</p><p>“Yes, but more – lots, hundreds, thousands of husbands!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Gee! But all these thousands husbands... then they must have lots of
children too!” “It is quite rare, but it happens, of course.”</p><p>“And these children, Daddy, what do they become?” “They become...
scholars!”</p><p>The East has never paid any respect to the scholars. They are
intellectual laborers, they are not real intelligentsia – the West has
always misunderstood them for real intelligentsia. They are
intellectuals, but they are not intelligent people. Sometimes you will
find the so-called intellectuals more stupid than the farmers and the
gardeners and the fishermen, for the simple reason because the farmers
and the gardeners and the fishermen and the carpenters, they live close
to nature, to life, to existence. They have a far truer experience, far
closer, intimate contact with reality than your so-called professors,
pundits and scholars. They live surrounded with words – big words,
bombastic words – but they live in prisons of words. You can be very
easily deceived by them because they talk in the same way as the
Masters. They are pseudo, they are pretenders. Beware of it and beware
of their stupidity.</p><p><br></p><p>An Englishman is walking up a mountain when he sees a famous
professor of philosophy passing in a car, driving backwards up the
hill.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hey, professor!” the surprised Englishman calls out. “What are you
doing?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well,” the professor answers, “I have to deliver a package up the
mountain and I was told it was impossible to turn around up there.”</p><p><br></p><p>After this both continued their trip up the hill. Fifteen minutes
later the Englishman sees the car coming down the hill backwards
again.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hey, professor, stop!” he says, “What is the matter?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh!” the professor replies smiling. “I was wrong – I could turn
anyway!”</p><p><br></p><p>The Master is one who lives the truth. Not that he knows about it,
not that he has heard about it, not that he philosophizes about it, but
he lives it, he knows it – he has become truth itself. His being is his
teaching; everything else is just a device to bring awakening to the
sleeping ones. If he uses words it is not to convey the truth, he uses
words like alarm clocks to wake you. The teacher uses the words to
convey truth. And truth can never be conveyed by words. The Master also
uses</p><p>the words, but never to convey the truth. He knows perfectly well
truth cannot be conveyed; it is untransferable. It cannot be
communicated by any means, but YOU can be awakened to it.</p><p><br></p><p>The real thing is not to tell you the truth; the real thing is to
make you aware. The moment you are aware you know the truth because
truth is already within you. It is not something that comes from the
outside; it is something that is asleep within you and has to be
awakened.</p><p><br></p><p>The Master uses words and because he uses words, scholars go on
repeating the same words for centuries, thinking that they are important
words, very important words. They must be containing truth because
Buddha used them, Ko Hsuan used them, Bodhidharma used them, Rinzai used
them, Bahauddin used them. Such great Masters have used them – those
words must contain something of immense value. They contain nothing.
They were used for a totally different purpose. The purpose was to
awaken the sleeping ones.</p><p><br></p><p>Brigitte Bardot was given a parrot as a gift and she put it in her
bedroom. Every night she would bring a new lover to her bed and from his
cage the parrot would encourage all her love-making with words like, “Go
on! Go on! You are coming!”</p><p><br></p><p>After a few days Brigitte Bardot got rather annoyed with him and when
one morning, while she was walking around naked, the parrot shouted,
“Come here, beloved, I want to make love to you!” she got infuriated and
beat the parrot up.</p><p><br></p><p>While smoothing his feathers the parrot sadly said, “But you did not
treat the other cocks like this!”</p><p><br></p><p>The pundit is a parrot. He thinks Buddha influenced millions of
people by these words, Krishna transformed thousands of people by these
words, Bhagavad Gita, and Mohammed has inspired thousands of souls for
centuries by Koran and the words that it contains – these words must be
of great potential. So he goes on repeating those words. But those words
contain nothing. He is simply imitating a device not knowing the exact
purpose of it.</p><p><br></p><p>A corporal is instructing his platoon. He calls a newly-arrived
soldier and asks him, “You, Gino! What is the flag for you?”</p><p><br></p><p>“The flag,” answers the soldier, “is a piece of cloth of different
colors.”</p><p><br></p><p>“What! What are you saying? You idiot! The flag is everything. The
flag is your mother, remember, your mother!”</p><p><br></p><p>Then he turns to the next soldier and asks, “Tell me what is a flag?”
“Gino’s mother,” replies the soldier.</p><p>Beware of the scholars; they are the most stupid people around. But
they talk beautifully, and if you are not alert you can be very easily
deceived by them. They recite Koran, they recite Bhagavad Gita, they
quote the Vedas, the Upanishads, they comment and they interpret, and in
a very logical way, in a convincing way – it will appeal to your mind.
But, in fact, Buddha never wanted to appeal to your mind, neither
Krishna wanted to appeal to your mind. They wanted to help you to go
beyond</p><p>the mind. They were not to convince your mind, because if you are
convinced about a certain idea you will remain IN the mind. They were
trying to unhinge you from the mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Can you see the totally different purpose? The purpose of a Master is
to push you beyond the boundaries of the mind, and the purpose of the
scholar is to convince you intellectually about the rightness, about the
validity of a certain ideology, philosophy. He makes your mind more
strengthened, he gives you more mind. The Master takes away your mind,
the Master destroys your mind. The teacher nourishes your mind. So many
times the teacher will look more appealing to you, more convincing to
you.</p><p><br></p><p>You can miss the Master very easily because he will seem a dangerous
person to be around. A teacher seems to be very fulfilling; he enhances
your ego. It is not accidental that the West has respected the teacher
because the West has believed for thousands of years that the ego has to
be strengthened, that a strong ego is needed; without a strong ego a man
has no personality. It is true: without a strong ego a man has no
personality; but ego is false, so is personality.</p><p><br></p><p>The word “personality” comes from a Greek word PERSONA; PERSONA means
a mask. In ancient days Greek actors used masks. Those PERSONAS, masks,
we are all carrying. A strong ego certainly gives you a strong
personality in the original sense of the word, but the personality is
not individuality and the ego is not your soul – just the contrary.</p><p><br></p><p>The Master destroys your personality so that your individuality can
be discovered. He dismantles your personality, he takes away all your
masks, so that you can know your original face. His work is difficult
and only very courageous people can be with him because it is surgical.
Your mask has become almost part of your existence; to take it away now
needs surgery. It is not easy to take it away, it is painful. Only a
Master is needed to take it away. Slowly slowly, chunk by chunk, he goes
on taking away your mask. Finally, when the mask has completely
disappeared, you discover your reality, your original face.</p><p><br></p><p>The teacher gives you to think much; the Master only gives you a
meditativeness. The teacher gives you much to dream about, to desire
about; the Master hammers on all your dreams and destroys them. The
Master is against your sleep; the teacher is a sedative, a tranquilizer.
The Master is not a solace, is not a consolation, is not a tranquilizer.
The Master hurts, wounds, but he transforms.</p><p><br></p><p>A man finds himself in purgatory. The angel-in-charge welcomes him
in.</p><p><br></p><p>“Not your turn today,” says the angel. “You still have more time to
pass on earth. Come with me.”</p><p><br></p><p>The angel takes him to a huge room full of small bottles full of oil.
“These show how much life you have left,” says the angel. His bottle is
almost empty.</p><p><br></p><p>“Can I see my wife’s and children’s bottles?” he asks.</p><p><br></p><p>“Sure,” says the angel, pointing to the three bottles next to his.
The man cannot believe his eyes. For the children, the quantity seems
normal, but his wife seems to have an extraordinary large quantity in
her bottle.</p><p>Left alone and thinking, as the angel is working with newcomers, he
delicately sticks his finger in his wife’s bottle, takes a little oil
and puts it in his own one. He keeps on doing this until the two bottles
are more or less even. He wants to go on, but is suddenly awakened by a
big slap and his wife’s voice saying, “You dirty old man, always
wandering fingers, even when I sleep!”</p><p><br></p><p>Man is deep asleep, dreaming, desiring, of hell, of heaven, of
thousand-and-one things. The function of the Master is to hit you so
hard that you cannot avoid waking up.</p><p><br></p><p>Ko Hsuan says:</p><p><br></p><p>THE VENERABLE MASTER SAID:</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN HE HAS CLEARLY THOUGHT ABOUT THESE THREE HE PERCEIVES ONLY A
VOID, BUT WHEN HE CONTEMPLATES THE VOID, HE REALIZES THAT THE VOID IS
ALSO VOID AND HAS BECOME NOTHINGNESS.</p><p><br></p><p>This is a very significant sutra, but first few words have to be put
right. The translation is done by a scholar and that too by a western
scholar. He says:</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN HE HAS CLEARLY THOUGHT...</p><p><br></p><p>Now the original cannot mean that he has “clearly thought”, because
clarity and thought cannot exist together. That’s impossible; their
coexistence is impossible. If there is clarity there is no thought; if
there is thinking there is no clarity. It is like saying, “The sky was
full of clouds and very clear. The sky was full of clouds and it was
very sunny.” It is impossible. Either it is sunny and the sky is clear,
then there are no clouds... If there are clouds, and many clouds, then
the sun will be hiding behind the clouds and there can be no clear sky.
You cannot see the sky because of the clouds.</p><p><br></p><p>Clarity is a byproduct of meditativeness, not of thought. But this is
what is going to happen when scholars do these things. In their own way
they are doing a great service, without knowing real differences. And
one cannot expect that they will be able to know – they have not
experienced clarity. They have thought about it, but to think about
clarity is one thing; to know clarity is a totally different thing.</p><p><br></p><p>I know clarity, but in clarity there is no thought at all. And I have
known thoughts: when there are thoughts there is no clarity. Hence, read
this sentence in a little different way:</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN HE HAS CLEARLY meditated THESE THREE things HE PERCEIVES ONLY A
VOID...</p><p>In the last sutra we talk-d about the three things: sexuality... In
India it is called KAMMA; it is the source of all desires. Remember it:
sexuality is not only the source of sex, it is the source of ALL
desires. Hence you can change your desires, you can forget about sex
completely, but if desires persist it is still sexuality. And you can
watch it...</p><p><br></p><p>There are people who are obsessed with money. You can see one thing:
they are no more interested in sex; their whole interest has moved into
money. But now money has become their sex object.</p><p>When they touch money they touch as if they are touching their
beloved. I have seen people touching hundred-rupee notes with such
tenderness – unbelievable.</p><p><br></p><p>I used to know one person whose only joy was money, even somebody
else’s money. Just if you are interested in beautiful women it does not
matter whose wife it is. If a beautiful woman passes by you become
immediately interested; a great desire arises in you. Civilization
prevents you; the police is there, the law is there, so you don’t do
anything, you don’t act – that is one thing – but the thought starts
fantasizing. The mind starts spinning, weaving dreams.</p><p><br></p><p>The same was true about this man. He was a relative of mine. Somebody
else’s money... if he will see that you have many notes in your pocket
he will just take the money out, will count it, with such tenderness –
and it is not his money either! He will give it back to you, but when he
will give you can see the sadness arising in his eyes, you can see the
unwillingness.</p><p><br></p><p>He was always asking for money, and he had enough money. He was
always borrowing money from others.</p><p><br></p><p>I used to ask him, “You have money – why you go on borrowing?”</p><p><br></p><p>And slowly slowly he became very honest with me and he said, “I
cannot use my own money in any way. It hurts to bring the money out of
my own pocket – it hurts. I feel almost paralyzed! I can borrow it from
somebody?”</p><p><br></p><p>And he never used to give back. He was well known all over the city,
that once he takes money from you he will never give back – he cannot.
Everybody used to feel pity for him. He had ten bungalows, but he
himself used to live in a very small room, in one of his bungalows’
servant quarters. He could have afforded a beautiful car, but he used to
move on a bicycle so ancient and old that I have never seen anything
older than that bicycle.</p><p><br></p><p>And I told him, “At least you can purchase a new bicycle!”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “But this bicycle has served me for so long. Moreover, it is
a gift from my father. Now my father is dead and this reminds me of my
father always. And one thing is very good about this bicycle – nobody
else can ride on it!”</p><p><br></p><p>It was really difficult to ride on it; only he was expert on riding
on it. It had only the very absolutely essential things in it – no chain
cover, no mudguards, no horn, nothing, no brakes – and it used to make
noise at least from half a mile away. And he will put it anywhere. He
said, “Nobody ever steals it. Who will steal it?” – the whole city knew
whose bicycle it is – “You will be caught immediately. And wherever you
will move the whole neighborhood will know that whose bicycle it
is.”</p><p><br></p><p>He will go into the movie house, but he will not put the bicycle on
the stand because there you have to pay ten paise or twenty paise or
something. He will put it anywhere outside the movie house and he will
always find his bicycle in its place, he never lost it. To the very last
day of his life he was using his bicycle.</p><p><br></p><p>He lived a poor man’s life, a very poor man’s life – the life of a
beggar. And he collected so much money... He had no son, no
daughter.</p><p>It almost always happens that miserly people don’t have children;
there must be some psychological reason in it. In India the very miserly
people have always to adopt children – rich people they are. Poor people
have many children, too many, in fact; they need birth control And the
rich people, the very rich, the miserly people, don’t have children.
They are so miserly that something deep happens even to their chemistry.
Their whole sexuality becomes obsessed with money.</p><p><br></p><p>Hence, remember, the first poison Ko Hsuan calls sexuality. It does
not mean only sex, it means all desires.</p><p><br></p><p>A Scotsman arrives at the toll gate of a bridge, gives a penny to the
attendant, and walks on. “Hey, young man!” shouts the attendant. “The
toll is two pennies!”</p><p>“I know, I know,” replies the young man in a tired voice, “but I will
only go half way and then I will jump!”</p><p><br></p><p>Coroner: “What were your husband’s last words, Mrs. Boccafucci?”</p><p><br></p><p>Mrs. Boccafucci: “Emilio said, ‘I don’t see how they can make a
profit on this chianti at a dollar a gallon.’”</p><p><br></p><p>Last words! Last words are always very important; they are the
essence of your whole life. There are people who even at the very end of
their life are thinking of money.</p><p><br></p><p>When God created Switzerland he asked a Swiss, “What do you want?”
Without hesitation the Swiss replied, “I want a lot of milk!”</p><p>And so it was.</p><p><br></p><p>After a few days god, curious, asked the Swiss, “Is your milk good?”
The best, my Lord,” replied the Swiss. “Try some!”</p><p>God tasted it and found it really good. then he asked the Swiss, “Do
you want something else?” Again, without hesitation, the Swiss replied,
“Yes, my Lord. Four francs for the milk you drank!”</p><p>Even if you come across God, if you are obsessed with money you won’t
see God at all; you will do the thing that you have been doing your
whole life. You will not change just by seeing God – nothing can change
you unless you drop the poison yourself. And this happens only when a
person becomes really meditative, when all thoughts disappear and he has
a clarity to see, when he becomes a seer.</p><p><br></p><p>The first poison is sexuality. And when you are thinking in terms of
sexuality, whatsoever form your sexuality has taken – it may have become
money obsession, it may have become power obsession, it does not matter
– when you are thinking in terms of sexuality, everything deep inside
you becomes sexual. Your whole life functions as a transforming
mechanism for everything, to create more and</p><p>more sexuality. Whatsoever you see, you see your own sexuality
projected – you can’t see anything else. You lose all clarity. You
become surrounded by your own inner poison; it goes on rising like smoke
around you and you can see only through the smoke, and the smoke
distorts everything that you see.</p><p><br></p><p>A black private and a white sergeant were getting ready to go on
leave, when, at the last minute, orders came that the private’s leave
was canceled. The black man said to the white, “Sergeant, would you
please tell my girlfriend what happened so she won’t think I ran off
with another lady? She will believe you because you are my
sergeant.”</p><p><br></p><p>The sergeant agreed and took the address. When he arrived in town he
looked up the house number and it turned out to be a whorehouse in the
red light district of town. He went up to the house and knocked on the
door.</p><p><br></p><p>A large, black madam opened the door. She looked at the sergeant and
said, “I am awfully sorry, sergeant, but we do not serve white men here,
only black men.”</p><p><br></p><p>The sergeant answered, “You don’t understand, madam! You see, I have
got this black private...” The madam smiled and said, “Well, ain’t you
the fancy one”</p><p>The second poison, anger, arises whenever your sexuality is
prevented. Anything that comes as an obstruction to your desires creates
anger. You cannot drop anger unless desires disappear.</p><p><br></p><p>Many people have asked me how to drop anger, and they6 don’t
understand that they are talking of dropping a symptom. anger is only a
symptom. It simply says somewhere your desire has been obstructed:
something is coming between you, your desire, and the object of your
desire – hence the anger. anger means, “I will destroy the obstruction!”
You cannot drop anger unless your sexuality disappears.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not accidental that husbands and wives continuously quarrel and
are angry with each other, for the simple reason... the sexuality. They
are each other’s sexual object, and wherever there is sexuality there is
anger. Anger is like smoke. Logicians say, “Wherever there is smoke
there is fire.” You can say, “Wherever there is anger there is
sexuality”. When anger disappears, that means sexuality has
disappeared.</p><p><br></p><p>The disappearance of anger happens only, is possible only, when the
root is no more there. You cannot drop your anger; you will have to go
to the very roots. Trying to drop your anger will only create new kinds
of anger: you will repress it from one side, it will come from another
side.</p><p><br></p><p>It is because of this well known fact that for centuries no country
has allowed its army people to have free sexuality, because if soldiers
are allowed to have freedom about their sexuality, if their sex is not
obstructed, then they lose destructiveness, then they lose anger, then
they are no more angry.</p><p><br></p><p>Their sex has to be obstructed in many ways. They have to be deprived
of their wives, they have to be kept away from their wives. Not only
that: they have to he allowed to see all kinds of pornographic films,
all kinds of pornographic magazines; they have to he allowed to come
in</p><p>contact with actresses. When two countries are at war, actresses go
to meet and visit the soldiers to encourage them. And what is their
encouragement? The encouragement is this: that when an actress comes, a
Sophia Loren comes, all the soldiers become sexually aroused. of course,
they cannot do anything about it; that aroused energy turns into anger,
it becomes rage. Then they start destroying the enemy, then they are
madly in destruction. If they are allowed to have their wives with them
on the front, their girlfriends, then they will lose interest in
war.</p><p><br></p><p>That is one of the reasons why Americans go on losing all wars: their
soldiers are the least sexually repressed people; they are not going to
win any war. Sexual repression is a must – it creates anger. And when
there is so much anger and there is no other outlet, then the only
possible outlet is destroy the enemy.</p><p><br></p><p>And have you watched? Always it happens whenever an army conquers a
country: the first victims are the women of that country; they are raped
immediately. Cannot you see the relationship? Were the soldiers fighting
for the women? Why immediately, the moment the soldiers enter a city as
conquerors, they start raping around as if they were just waiting for
the opportunity? There was no opportunity available; now it is
available. The first thing is: rape the women. And the second thing is:
rob people of their money. The first comes out of anger and the second
comes out of greed, but the cause of both lies in the first. Repressed
sex will create anger and greed.</p><p><br></p><p>You will be surprised to know that any religion that has been
teaching to its followers some kind of repression has always helped its
followers to become rich. In India, Jains have become very rich; they
are the most repressive people. And something of significance has to he
understood about their psychology. Their religion says: Repress sex;
BRAHMACHARYA, celibacy is their goal. And second thing: Don’t he
violent; so anger is not allowed. Sex is not allowed, anger is not
allowed. Now where the energy is to go? Now only the third possibility
is left – greed. So all the Jains have become the greediest persons in
this country. They are a small community, very small community – in such
a big, vast country they are nothing – but still they are very powerful
because they have all the money. You will not come across a single Jain
beggar; nothing like it exists. They are not poor people – they cannot
be poor; their religion has made it absolutely certain for them that
they will he rich. Sex has to he repressed and anger has to he
repressed. Now only one outlet is left – greed. Become greedy.</p><p>Do you know? The English word “love” comes from a Sanskrit root
LOBHA. LOBHA means greed; it is greed for the other’s body. So whenever
a person looks sexually at somebody else you can see the greed in his
eyes: he wants to possess the other’s body. That’s why every
civilization allows only a certain time limit to see; more than that is
thought to he offensive. Somehow a subtle agreement has happened, a deep
contract: three seconds are allowed. If you watch at a woman tor three
seconds, no offense will he taken; it will be thought just casual. But
if you watch more, then she will become annoyed. If you go on looking at
her, then she will be angry; then you are behaving in an uncivilized
way. You are looking at her body with greed to possess, to exploit, to
use as a means. And. of course, nobody wants to be reduced into a means,
into a thing, into a possession.</p><p>The English word “greed” also comes from a Sanskrit word, GRIDDHA;
GRIDDHA means the vulture. The greedy person has a vulture-like quality,
as if he wants to eat the other. And that kind of expression has come
into many languages, particularly in French.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard:</p><p>A ship wrecked, and a Frenchwoman swam to an island. She was
absolutely naked; all her clothes had gone into the sea. But the beach
was beautiful, and she was lying on the beach naked, taking a sunbath,
thinking “What to do next?” – whether anybody lives on this island or
not. There seemed to he no sign of anybody living...</p><p><br></p><p>And then suddenly she heard a noise; somebody was coming, a very big
man, almost like a huge gorilla. A very small tribe lived there. The
tribe was of cannibals, hence very small, because cannibals cannot grow
– they start eating each other. And the cannibal was very happy seeing a
new food – so delicious she was looking!</p><p><br></p><p>He came, looked at her and said, “I would like to eat you!” And the
Frenchwoman said, “Then what you are waiting for?”</p><p>The cannibal was puzzled. This was for the first time that somebody
has said, “Why you are waiting? For what? Start!” – because in French
“to eat” means “I want to make love to you.”</p><p><br></p><p>Language gives great indications. In fact, when you look at a woman
with greedy eyes you want to eat her – or a woman looks at a man...
Ordinarily they don’t look because they have been taught for centuries
not to look at the man; that has become their feminine grace. When
somebody says to a woman, “I love you,” she looks downward – just to he
certain whether he really means it or is just talking nonsense! She does
not believe in words, she believes in the body, she believes in the
physiology – and the body never lies.</p><p><br></p><p>When one has come to deep meditation there is a clarity. In this
clarity all the three poisons disappear without leaving a trace behind.
And then he perceives only a void.</p><p><br></p><p>The first experience of meditation is that of a void, but remember it
is a first experience, the first SATORI: one experiences void. But
remember, the experience is still there; that’s why it is still the
beginning, not the end. You experience the void, but the void
EXPERIENCED itself becomes something; it is not nothing.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why you will come across many Zen stories...</p><p><br></p><p>The disciple comes to the Master and says, “I have experienced
nothing,” and the Master hits him and says, “So back and meditate again!
You missed!”</p><p><br></p><p>“But,” he says, “I have experienced nothing! And that’s what you were
saying – that to experience nothing is what meditation is all about. And
I have experienced it!”</p><p><br></p><p>But the Master still persists: “You go and meditate again – you
missed.” Because if nothingness becomes also an experience, then it is
something. You can experience only some thing. You have experienced
nothingness, but once experienced it becomes an object, and there is a
division: the knower and the known. Hence it is the first SATORI.</p><p><br></p><p>Ko Hsuan’s sutra is tremendously beautiful. He says:</p><p><br></p><p>... HE PERCEIVES ONLY A VOID, BUT WHEN BE CONTEMPLATES THE
VOID...</p><p>but when he goes deeper into meditation</p><p><br></p><p>... HE REALIZES THAT THE VOID IS ALSO VOID AND HAS BECOME A
NOTHINGNESS.</p><p><br></p><p>As he goes deeper, the second satori opens up. Going deeper, he
disappears as an experiencer. First the object disappeared, the void was
there; but because of the old habit the void became the object. Now the
experiencer has also gone. Now there is only nothingness – nobody to
experience, nothing to be experienced. This is the second SATORI.</p><p><br></p><p>THE VOID HAVING VANISHED INTO NOTHINGNESS, HE REALIZES THAT THIS
NOTHINGNESS OF NOTHING IS ALSO NOTHING...</p><p><br></p><p>This is the last possibility of still getting hooked into an
experience. You can start rejoicing, that “I have experienced nothing;”
then you remain hooked with the first SATORI. You can start rejoicing,
that “I have experienced that there is no experience and no experiencer.
I have experienced that both are void.” It is better than the first,
deeper than the first, but somehow the experiencer has still saved
itself in a subtle way. It has moved a little deeper – now it says, “I
have experienced that there is no experience and no experiencer.” You
will be hooked in the second satori.</p><p><br></p><p>The third SATORI happens when:</p><p><br></p><p>... HE REALIZES THAT THE NOTHINGNESS OF NOTHING IS ALSO NOTHING, AND
WHEN THE NETHERMOST NOTHINGNESS IS REACHED...</p><p><br></p><p>And this is the ultimate nothingness; then he does not claim at all.
Now if you ask him, “What have you experienced?” he will smile. He
cannot say, “I have experienced nothingness.” This is SAMADHI – the
third SATORI, the ultimate flowering. Now there is nothing left, neither
as an object nor as a subject nor as a transcendental subject which
transcends both. Nothing is left. Buddha has called it ANATTA, no-self –
a state of total nothingness, absolute nothingness. Hence, what can he
said about it?</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever anybody asked Buddha about his ultimate experience he will
say, “Don’t ask absurd questions, ask practical questions. Ask how to
reach it, don’t ask what has happened. It cannot he conveyed.”</p><p><br></p><p>Lao Tzu says: Truth said becomes a falsehood Truth unsaid remains
true: uttered, becomes false. The Upanishads say: Those who say that “We
know,” know not.</p><p>Socrates in his last stage of life said. “I know only one thing, that
I know nothing.” But Ko Hsuan will say even that is not right: that is
second satori,. because he is still saying, “I know only one thing. that
I know nothing.” Still the statement is there, still the knower is
there. According to Ko Hsuan, at least, the statement is wrong. Socrates
attained the ultimate SAMADHI, but Socrates is a Greek, he is not a
Chinese – he speaks the way Greeks could have understood. He cannot
speak in paradoxes, he speaks logically. Hence he says, I know only one
thing, that I know nothing.”</p><p><br></p><p>Ko Hsuan will not even say that; Buddha will not say even that: Lao
Tzu will not even say that.</p><p>WHEN this NETHERMOST NOTHINGNESS IS REACHED, THERE IS MOST TRULY TO
BE FOUND A DEEP AND UNCHANGING STILLNESS.</p><p><br></p><p>Now for the first time a deep, unchanging stillness prevails.
Eternity has opened its doors to you. Now there is no more falling hack.
You have gone beyond the beyond. You have transcended even the
transcendental.</p><p><br></p><p>IN THIS PROFOUND STILLNESS HOW CAN DESIRES BE BEGOTTEN? WHEN DESIRES
ARE NO LONGER BEGOTTEN, THEN THERE IS ESSENTIAL AND UNCHANGING
STILLNESS.</p><p><br></p><p>TRUTH IS ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGING.</p><p><br></p><p>ALL THINGS IN HEAVEN AND EARTH ARE IN ESSENCE UNCHANGING.</p><p><br></p><p>So whatsoever changes is only the appearance, what in India the
mystics have called MAYA. It is only appearance.</p><p>Forms change; the essential truth remains the same. Waves change; the
ocean remains the same forever. Once you have seen this you are no more
in any misery because you are no more in any desire, no more in any
dreams. Once you have experienced this you have become part of the
organic whole. You have disappeared; you have become the very ocean. You
are no more a wave, you are no more a dewdrop, you are oceanic.</p><p><br></p><p>To experience this oceanic vastness is the experience of Tao. And the
secret is in meditation. And one has to pass through three stages: first
satori, the experience of the void; second SATORI, the experience that
the void is void; and the third SATORI... now nothing can be said
anymore. Now all is silent and still, absolutely silent and still.</p><p><br></p><p>The Master is one who has reached to this third, one who has
transcended the transcendental, one who has gone beyond the beyond Then
he has the being of the whole. To be in tune with him is to be in tune
with God, with Tao, with truth. To be in tune with him is to be in tune
with bliss, with beauty, with benediction.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part2>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

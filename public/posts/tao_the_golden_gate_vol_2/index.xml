‌CHAPTER 1
Man is a Becoming
21 June 1980 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1 OSHO,
WHY IS IT THAT ONLY HUMANS REPRESS, MANIPULATE, KILL, TRY TO CONQUER THE NATURAL FLOW IN NATURE, THE TAO? WHY ARE WE SO STUPID?
HEIN,
Man is not a being, man is a becoming. This is one of the most fundamental things to be understood.</description>

‌CHAPTER 10
Religion: the Ultimate Luxury
30 June 1980 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1 OSHO,
I WISH YOU WOULD SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE EASTERN INDIFFERENCE TO WHAT YOU ARE DOING, AND THE WESTERN ATTRACTION.
Durga Prasad Pandari,
It is a very natural phenomenon. Religion is the ultimate luxury.
Man lives on three planes. If his bodily needs are fulfilled, only then psychological needs become significant; otherwise not.</description>

‌CHAPTER 2
It is always today
22 June 1980 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1 OSHO,
WHY IS IT SO DIFFICULT TO FORGIVE, TO STOP CLINGING TO HURTS LONG SINCE PAST?
Anand Katyayani,
The ego exists on misery – the more misery the more nourishment for it. In blissful moments the ego totally disappears, and vice versa: if the ego disappears, bliss starts showering on you.</description>

‌CHAPTER 3
Transcending the Transcendental
23 June 1980 am in Buddha Hall
THE VENERABLE MASTER SAID:
WHEN HE HAS CLEARLY THOUGHT ABOUT THESE THREE HE PERCEIVES ONLY A VOID, BUT WHEN HE CONTEMPLATES THE VOID, HE REALIZES THAT THE VOID IS ALSO VOID AND HAS BECOME A NOTHINGNESS. THE VOID HAVING VANISHED INTO NOTHINGNESS, HE REALIZES THAT THE NOTHINGNESS OF NOTHING IS ALSO NOTHING, AND WHEN THE NETHERMOST NOTHINGNESS IS REACHED, THERE IS MOST TRULY TO BE FOUND A DEEP AND UNCHANGING STILLNESS.</description>

‌CHAPTER 4
Just Joking Around
24 June 1980 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1 OSHO,
COULD YOU SAY SOMETHING ABOUT INNOCENCE AND IGNORANCE?
Chitprem,
The difference between the two is immense; it is as vast as possible. It is the difference between darkness and light, the difference between death and life, the difference between unconsciousness and consciousness, the difference between hell and heaven.</description>

‌CHAPTER 5
This Moment is All
25 June 1980 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1 OSHO,
SO MANY TIMES I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU, BUT SOMEHOW THE SILENCE SAYS IT SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE WORDS.
Yoga Chetana,
The really significant things in life can never be said through words; only silence is capable of communion.Words are utilitarian, they belong to the marketplace; hence, when you really want to say something of the heart, you will always find it unsayable.</description>

‌CHAPTER 6
I really mean business
26 June 1980 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1 OSHO,
TAO IS GREATER THAN MIND. THEN WHY DO WE KEEP CHOOSING THE MIND INSTEAD OF FLOWING WITH THE TAO?
Prem Radha,
It is precisely because of that. Tao is so vast that one is afraid to lose one’s identity in it. We are like dewdrops and Tao is like an ocean.</description>

‌CHAPTER 7
I have heard
27 June 1980 am in Buddha Hall
THE VENERABLE MASTER SAID:
THE UNFOLDMENT OF MAN’S MIND LEADS HIM TO THIS UNCHANGING TRUTH. IN UNCHANGING STILLNESS, UNCHANGING PURITY AND REST ARE FOUND. HE WHO ATTAINS PURITY AND STILLNESS ENTERS INTO THE IMMUTABLE TAO.
HAVING ENTERED INTO THE IMMUTABLE TAO HE IS NAMED THE POSSESSOR OF TAO.
ALTHOUGH HE IS NAMED THE POSSESSOR OF TAO HE KNOWS THAT HE DOES NOT POSSESS IT.</description>

‌CHAPTER 8
We can share
28 June 1980 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1 OSHO,
PLEASE SAY A FEW WORDS ABOUT SANJAY GANDHI AND HIS DEATH. HE RESPECTED AND LOVED YOU AND HAD SAID TO LAXMI JUST A WEEK BEFORE HIS DEATH THAT SOON HE WILL BE COMING TO VISIT THE ASHRAM AND TO SEE YOU.
Anand Arun,
Sanjay Gandhi was a beautiful person, a man of immense integrity, individuality, adventure.</description>

‌CHAPTER 9
Save me from the Pillar!
29 June 1980 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1 OSHO,
WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME THAT I CANNOT SEE WHAT YOU ARE SHOWING TO ME?
Prem Vishva,
There is only one thing wrong with everybody, not only with you. That is a universal problem; it has nothing to do with individuals. It is the mind – the mind keeps your vision closed.</description>

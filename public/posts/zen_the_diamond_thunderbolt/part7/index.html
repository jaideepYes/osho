GUARD IT WELL ON YOUR OWN.”\nManeesha, before I discuss the anecdote placed before me, I have few a urgent things to say.\nFirst: one of my very intimate and ancient enemies, ex-Prime Minister Morarji Desai, has been thrown out of his home in Bombay by the Supreme Court. At his age – he must be more than ninety\n.… He has been occupying the house, Oceana, on Marine Drive, for twenty-two years illegally. When\nhe was in power the owner of the house could not do anything, but now he is no more in power. He is weeping before the news media, saying, “I have been made homeless.”\nI would like to invite him to be part of my ashram here, on two conditions. First, he has to undergo a test for AIDS and produce the negative certificate. Secondly, he has to drop the dirty old habit of drinking his own urine – that is prohibited here. He can bring his spinning wheel, it is innocent; and we will not ask him to do anything else – he can go on spinning his wheel day and night. We will provide him with every facility that is possible, even though while he was in power he tried constantly to destroy this ashram, not knowing that in the end only this ashram would provide him a home.\nLife takes strange turns.\nSecondly: all over India, the progressive and intelligent newspapers and magazines have supported my statements against the Shankaracharya of Puri. But a few Hindu chauvinists have criticized me and I have to answer them.\nOne criticism has appeared in many papers by a man called Sharma. It is hilarious to see that people don’t even understand the meaning of their surnames. Sharma comes from sharman, the name of the lowest brahmin class, who used to butcher cows in their religious rituals. ‘Sharman’ means ‘the butcher’. Still, people go on writing under the name Sharma, not knowing that they are declaring their butcherhood and their forefathers’ ugly violence.\nHe has been writing against me, that I should not ask for a negative AIDS test from the Shankaracharya because he is celibate. How does he know? Just because he is a religious head, that does not mean that he cannot have AIDS. In fact, there is more possibility of his having AIDS because he is a celibate and a religious head than there would be in any other profession.\nIt is now a proved fact all over the world that priests have been found to be homosexuals, and many priests are suffering from AIDS. We cannot make any exception for anybody. In fact, the Shankaracharya of Puri has declared himself a harijan. According to his scriptures, he should not enter into any temple – his own temple included. And if he enters into any temple, that means that harijans can enter into any temple around the country.\nPeople have been deceiving ... that just by changing namesAll the Hindu scriptures call them\nsudras – untouchables – but now suddenly they have become ‘harijans’ – ‘beloved of God’. And if they are beloved of God, who are all these other bastards – five billion – in the world? And only God’s beloveds are not allowed to enter in the temples, and everybody else is allowed?\nReligion and politics together have been the greatest calamity for humanity. Not a single politician has spoken against the Shankaracharya’s statements because they are afraid that if harijans separate from Hindus – although Hindus have for thousands of years kept them separateThere\nis no need to keep them separate – they are separate. The politician is worried, not about the temple, not about the scriptures – but because the harijans have one fourth of the Hindu votes. If they go out of the Hindu fold, these politicians will be out of power.\nThey are completely silent on such an important issue, and rather than arresting the priests who were preventing harijans from entering Nath Dwara, the harijans have been arrested. And still these politicians and priests want harijans to remain part of Hindu society.\nThere is a limit to everything. This is too much – too inhuman! They cannot read Hindu scriptures. They cannot touch Hindus – not even with their shadow. They cannot remain in the city – they have to live outside it. They cannot enter into any temple. On what grounds are they called Hindus?\nAnd this fellow, Sharma, is blaming me, that I am trying to create a separation. I am not creating a separation, Sharma; it is you and your forefathers who have kept the harijans separate. I am trying to bring them into the temples. And if you want them to be part of your politics, then forget your scriptures and let them into the temples.\nEven a man like Mahatma Gandhi lied. Although he has written an autobiography entitled MY EXPERIMENTS WITH THE TRUTH, he obviously does not know truth; he is still experimenting. And meanwhile he is using so many lies. He promised that the first president of India after the British left would be a harijan – and not only a harijan, but a harijan woman. And as the British Empire disappeared, the person who became president was neither a harijan nor a woman. The person who became the prime ministerThe whole power went into the hands of those same\nexploiters who had been oppressing this country for centuries. From the British, it passed into the hands of the old exploiters, and India remains in slavery.\nBecause I am telling the truth, it hurts.\nMahatma Gandhi used to pray every evening and morning, “God is one. You can call him Ram, you can call him Allah.” But it was just to keep the Hindus and Mohammedans together for political reasons. He never mentioned the KORAN; he always mentioned the GITA and called the GITA his mother. Although he is dead, I want it to be on record that the KORAN must therefore be his father.\nHis eldest son, Haridas, married a Mohammedan woman, and converted to Mohammedanism. It was a true test of Mahatma Gandhi’s honesty, his integrity – and he failed in it. He said to his wife, “Haridas cannot enter into my house again. And I don’t want to see him even when I die.” The tradition in India is that when a man dies, his eldest son gives fire to the funeral pyre. Gandhi’s anger was so much that he willed it that Haridas would not be allowed to even come near his funeral pyre. He would be dead, but his angerand the whole world thinks he was a man of peace; the\nwhole world thinks he was a mahatma, a ‘great soul’ – my foot!\nHe had said that the country would be divided into India and Pakistan only over his dead body. But the country was divided with his consent, and he completely forgot that he had been saying continually: “While I am alive, the country cannot be divided.” He was the one who was responsible for dividing the country.\nHe was also the one who gave the untouchables the name ‘harijans’. But he himself never tried to allow harijans their dignity as human beings, because he could not offend the higher Hindu castes. Harijans are perhaps the longest-exploited group of people in the world – they are utterly crushed. But not even the prime minister of India, Rajiv Gandhi, has spoken against the Shankaracharya. In fact, he will go and touch his feet just to gain the votes of the high-caste Hindus. Those two hundred harijans could not have been arrested without Rajiv’s knowing. It will be good when the Shankaracharya gathers the courage to come here. Rajiv is also invited – because these politicians and priests together are the cause of the poverty and the slavery of this country. But they are interested only in their power. I am not a politician, but they seem to be very much afraid of me.\nIt is a strange story but even Indians coming to the ashram are being harassed by the police; and these are police sent from Delhi, by the central government. And Indians are being asked for their passports – in their own country. It is against the very constitution; it is against freedom of movement – in your own country you have to carry your passport! I have never heard such a stupidity happening anywhere in the world; but India is really a genius in being stupid.\nIt is strange that although India is in such poverty, it is wasting 190 million dollars per year on advertising in other countries for tourists to come to India. And on the other hand, when my people come here they are harassed in every possible way. And my people are pouring ten million rupees per day into Poona’s economy. If the government was a little intelligent, instead of there being seven thousand people here, there could be one hundred thousand sannyasins from all over the world. I wanted Poona to be the capital of the world. But because of these idiots .…\nRajiv is perfectly aware that it was me who proposed to Indira Gandhi to train him to be the prime minister. He is taking revenge on me because he knows I was the person. And he was afraid and Indira said to me, “What can I do? You try to convince him. He does not want to leave his service as a pilot in Indian Airlines.”\nAnd now that he is the prime ministerWhen he was just a pilot, he was asking again and again to\ncome here to see me, to ask my advice. And now he is the person in power who is trying all around the world, through the Indian embassies, to refuse to give visas to anybody who is coming to Poona. Poona has become my personal property!\nI want the whole world to know that if people are harassed because they are coming to Poona, then no tourist should come to India. Then let them suffer the whole loss, and stop your Department of Tourism – the whole ministry is meaningless. They are doing contradictory things: they invite people to see the relics of Ajanta and Ellora and now they are advertising very heavily in Japan for the Buddhists to come to Bodhgaya where Buddha became enlightened. But they are preventing people from coming here where Buddha is still alive! He is not only alive – he is ready to impart the same consciousness to anybody who is receptive. Bodhgaya can have no meaning at all, it is just a graveyard.\nI want my sannyasins to be aware that they should not be in any way defensive in Indian embassies. Make them aware: “Your government is inviting us – all these posters and advertisements on the television, on the radio, in newspapers – and who are you to prevent us?”\nHundreds of people have been sent back from Indian airports, just on the suspicion that they may be my sannyasins. Perhaps many may not even have known my name. A few sannyasins who have come have had to deny that they know me at all. “Do you want us to know something about Osho before we can enter India?” They have to give a promise that they are not going to see Osho. What kind of fear is this? It is the fear of truth; because politics is the profession of lying, just as priesthood is.\nWe have to fight around the world against all kinds of priests and all kinds of politicians. It is a question of the very survival of freedom on the earth.\nManeesha has brought:\nBELOVED OSHO,\nWHEN GANTO TOOK LEAVE OF TOKUSAN, TOKUSAN SAID, “WHERE ARE YOU GOING?”\nGANTO SAID, “FOR NOW I AM TAKING LEAVE OF YOU, MASTER, AND GOING DOWN THE MOUNTAIN.”\nTOKUSAN SAID, “AFTER THAT, THEN WHAT?” GANTO SAID, “I WON’T FORGET YOU, MASTER.” “BY VIRTUE OF WHAT DO YOU SAY THIS?” INQUIRED TOKUSAN.\nGANTO SAID, “HAVEN’T YOU HEARD THAT WHEN A MONK’S KNOWLEDGE IS EQUAL TO HIS TEACHER’S, HE HAS LESS THAN HALF HIS TEACHER’S VIRTUE; WHEN HIS KNOWLEDGE SURPASSES THE TEACHER’S, ONLY THEN IS HE QUALIFIED FOR THE TRANSMISSION?”\nTOKUSAN SAID, “SO IT IS, SO IT IS. GUARD IT WELL ON YOUR OWN.”\nIn translation, the most significant part is always lost. Tokusan is a great master. Ganto was a student, not even a disciple, because a disciple never takes leave of the master. A disciple becomes almost a part of the very being of the master. There arises an invisible connection between the two hearts. They dance together.\nBut Ganto must have been just a student, collecting knowledge from this master, from that master. He was not even aware of the distinction between the teacher and the master, nor about the distinction between the disciple and the student. A student is concerned with knowledge, a disciple is concerned with being; he just wants to be at the highest peak of his own potentiality. He does not want to carry scriptures unnecessarily on his back, he wants the lotus to blossom within his own being. A disciple is not a student. A disciple is a lover. The student is only collecting knowledge.\nTOKUSAN SAID, “WHERE ARE YOU GOING? If you are really a disciple, there is no going, no coming anymore, because you have found the catalytic agent which is going to transform your being. But if you are going, at least I can ask you where.” It is out of compassion that Tokusan is saying to Ganto, “Please understand: going away from here is going away from yourself. By accident, you have come very close to the explosion, so where are you going now? When spring is about to come, you are going? When the flowers are going to blossom in all their colors, you are going? Where are you going?”\nGanto could not understand. A student is very poor as far as existential experience is concerned.\nGANTO SAID, “FOR NOW I AM TAKING LEAVE OF YOU, MASTER, AND GOING DOWN THE MOUNTAIN.”\nHe does not know the difference between master and teacher; he has no right to call Tokusan ‘master’. In the dictionary it means the same thing, but life is not a dictionary. The master is one\nwho can transmit his being to you, who can – just by being present – create a situation in which you become a fire. The teacher can only talk about what the scriptures say. The master is a presence, a silence. Even in his words, he is trying to help you to move towards the wordless.\nBut Ganto was in sheer confusion. He said, “FOR NOW I AM TAKING LEAVE OF YOU, MASTER\n...”\nIf I had been in the place of Tokusan, I would have ordered Sardar Gurudayal Singh to take care of this fellow Ganto, to hit him three times. He cannot use the word ‘master’, he is making it synonymous with ‘teacher’.\n” ... AND GOING DOWN THE MOUNTAIN.” TOKUSAN SAID, “AFTER THAT, THEN WHAT?\nWhat will you do down the mountain? From THERE, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?“GANTO SAID,”I WON’T FORGET YOU, MASTER.” There is no question of forgetting the master. The disciple carries the master in his heart, not in his memory. He is carrying the same flame within him, not in his thoughts.\nGANTO SAID, “I WON’T FORGET YOU, MASTER.”\nAgain and again, it is becoming clearer that he is simply a student.\nTokusan asked him, “BY VIRTUE OF WHAT DO YOU SAY THIS?” He is saying, “You have not even known me. On what grounds are you saying that you will not forget me? How can you forget someone you have not known either? Before you can forget, the basic requirement is at least to know. By what virtue are you saying this?”\nGANTO SAID, – and this is a quotation from ancient Buddhist scriptures – “HAVEN’T YOU HEARD THAT WHEN A MONK’S KNOWLEDGE IS EQUAL TO HIS TEACHER’S, HE HAS LESS THAN HALF HIS TEACHER’S VIRTUE; WHEN HIS KNOWLEDGE SURPASSES THE TEACHER’S, ONLY THEN IS HE QUALIFIED FOR THE TRANSMISSION?”\nHe does not understand what he is talking about. This statement in the Buddhist scriptures has nothing to do with knowledge; it has something to do with knowing. That’s how things change their color in translations. Knowing is an existential thing, knowledge is just memory. Even a computer has knowledge because it has memory. By memorizing scriptures, you don’t prove your intelligence, you only prove that you are a good computer.\nThe scriptures certainly say this, “If the disciple’s knowing is even half of his master’s knowing, he also has half the virtue that his master has. But if his knowing surpasses the teacher’s, only then is he qualified for the transmission.”\nIn the translation, everything has become topsy-turvy. You cannot surpass the master’s knowing because the master in the ultimate sense knows nothing. How can you surpass nothing – do you think there is any possibility? Something can be surpassed, but nothing cannot be surpassed. Nothing is vast and limitless, how can you surpass it?\nBut Tokusan is one of the great compassionate teachers. Rather than hitting Ganto, out of compassion he simply says, “Yes. It is so, SO IT IS. GUARD IT WELL ON YOUR OWN. I take back my responsibility for you, now you are on your own, be on guard.” In fact what he is saying is, “Now I am no more concerned with you. You are breaking all the bridges between you and me. Whatever you think, whatever you have understood, guard it well and be on your own.”\nNo master can force anybody to be enlightened. No master can create a fetter for the disciple. No master will say, “Remain with me.” It is the disciple’s heart that wants to remain. It is not an order from the side of the master, it is the love from the side of the disciple. It is a great love affair, ‘the great matter’. You can understand it because you are not students and this is not a university. This is simply a gathering of seekers who have fallen in love with a master, who have recognized in their deepest heart that this is the place where they belong.\nBut it is not an order. From my side, you are absolutely free. If nobody comes here, I will still come every evening to talk to the bamboos. It is your decision to be here or not to be here. But Tokusan is compassionate, saying that, “If you are leaving, then just be on guard. You can go astray very easily. You have not understood anything.”\nA haiku by Boryu:\nCLOUD ABOVE LOTUS – IT TOO\nBECOMES A BUDDHA.\nI love this haiku particularly for this series. It is dedicated to the clouds. CLOUD ABOVE LOTUS – IT TOO BECOMES A BUDDHA. To be a buddha is everybody’s right. If you don’t claim it, it is only your fault. Recognize it and live it and you will be suddenly surprised that everything in your life is changing – just from the recognition that your inner being is already a buddha, already awakened. But you have not taken care.\nThe English word ‘ignorance’ is beautiful, but not in the sense that it is usually understood. To me it means ignoring your buddhahood. That is ignorance, the only ignorance. Ignoring your buddhahood – the only ignorance; knowing your buddhahood – the only knowledge.\nSaigyo’s verse runs:\nWHAT IT IS\nI KNOW NOT;\nBUT WITH GRATITUDE MY TEARS FALL.\nJust today, Leela has sent a question to me: “People who are doing the Mystic Rose meditation in the third stage, the watcher on the hills – many start feeling tears coming for no reason at all. What has to be done about it?”\nLeela, nothing has to be done about it. This is simply beautiful. These tears are not of pain. These tears of people in silence are of gratitude. These are just flowers, they are pouring unto the feet of existence itself. Rejoice in their tears. Remember this saying of Saigyo – a great master – WHAT IT IS, I KNOW NOT; BUT WITH GRATITUDE MY TEARS FALL.\nManeesha has asked:\nBELOVED OSHO, THE UNSURPASSABLE MAN,\nWOULD YOU AGREE THAT YOUR DISCIPLES WILL HAVE ONLY PROVED THEMSELVES WHEN THEY SURPASS YOU? OR DO WE NEED ONLY TO SURPASS OURSELVES?\nThe moment, Maneesha, you surpass yourself ... then there is no you and no I. When the disciple surpasses himself, there is a great meeting of consciousnesses; just as when lovers meet, it is at a lower status, a meeting of bodies. The master and disciple meet at the highest altitude – as pure consciousnesses, as two clouds merging into each other. There is no question of surpassing the master, because when you have surpassed yourself, you will not find any master, you will not find any disciple. You will find only a pure consciousness which is one.\nBefore we enter into this one consciousness, a few small laughters, just to make the journey a little light.\nOld Mrs. Bathead and Mrs. Kooch meet on holiday and are sitting on the porch of their Catskill Mountain hotel.\n“Oh my God!” exclaims Mrs. Bathead. “Look at that boy. Did you ever see such a big twisted nose? And such a huge crooked mouth? And look – he is cross-eyed too!”\n“That,” says Mrs. Kooch, “happens to be my son.”\n“Well,” says Mrs. Bathead, “on him, it looks very becoming.”\nKowalski and Nurdski stagger out of the bar, stumble over to a lamppost, unzip, take things in hand and start to pee.\nA cop sees them standing there, walks over and says, “Hey, you two! Put those things away and stop what you are doing. Where do you think you are, India?”\nThe two Polacks zip up their pants obediently. But when the cop has gone, Kowalski starts to laugh. “What is so funny?” asks Nurdski.\n“I fooled that cop,” says Kowalski, “I put it away, but I didn’t stop!” Jemima and Beulah are hanging out on the front porch.\n“Did you hear about Mrs. Berrypatch having quadruplets?” says Jemima.\n“Well what the hell are they?” cries Beulah.\n“Dumb cluck!” says Jemima. “That’s when you have four babies in one go. And I heard that it only happens once every sixty thousand times!”\n“Glory Jeezus!” howls Beulah. “When the hell does that woman ever get her housework done?”\nIn this insane world, a few minutes of sanity now. Nivedano, give the beat and everybody goes crazy. (Drumbeat)\n(Gibberish) Nivedano ... (Drumbeat) Be silent.\nClose your eyes.\nLet your body become almost frozen, no movement.\nGather your consciousness inwards. Deeper and deeper,\nwithout any fear,\nbecause it is your own sky\nand there are no clouds, no obstacles. Just go like an arrow, in and in.\nAt this moment you are the buddha. Remember it, guard it,\nbecause it is your ultimate treasure. This is your height, this is your depth. This is you in your eternity.\nTo make it more clear, Nivedano ...\n(Drumbeat) Relax, let go.\nBe dead, so that you can feel the contrast between the body and consciousness.\nThe body is only a temporary house, a caravanserai, an overnight stay.\nIn the morning we have to go.\nBut consciousness is the eternal pilgrim, a journey without any beginning and without any end.\nIt is a journey of dances\nand songs and music and poetry, a festive journey,\na ceremony without any reason. Just being is enough.\nAt this moment, you make this place the holiest place in the world.\nSo many buddhas, so many people\ncentered in their being,\nthe whole garden is full of roses. Drink it deep.\nIt is the very juice of your immortality. Nivedano ... call all the buddhas back. (Drumbeat)\nSit down for few moments, remembering,\nrejoicing,\nrecollecting where you have been.

THE MOUNTAIN.”</p><p><br></p><p>TOKUSAN SAID, “AFTER THAT, THEN WHAT?” GANTO SAID, “I WON’T FORGET

a urgent things to say.</p><p><br></p><p>First: one of my very intimate and ancient enemies, ex-Prime Minister
Morarji Desai, has been thrown out of his home in Bombay by the Supreme
Court. At his age – he must be more than ninety</p><p>.… He has been occupying the house, Oceana, on Marine Drive, for
twenty-two years illegally. When</p><p>he was in power the owner of the house could not do anything, but now
he is no more in power. He is weeping before the news media, saying, “I
have been made homeless.”</p><p><br></p><p>I would like to invite him to be part of my ashram here, on two
conditions. First, he has to undergo a test for AIDS and produce the
negative certificate. Secondly, he has to drop the dirty old habit of
drinking his own urine – that is prohibited here. He can bring his
spinning wheel, it is innocent; and we will not ask him to do anything
else – he can go on spinning his wheel day and night. We will provide
him with every facility that is possible, even though while he was in
power he tried constantly to destroy this ashram, not knowing that in
the end only this ashram would provide him a home.</p><p><br></p><p>Life takes strange turns.</p><p><br></p><p>Secondly: all over India, the progressive and intelligent newspapers
and magazines have supported my statements against the Shankaracharya of
Puri. But a few Hindu chauvinists have criticized me and I have to
answer them.</p><p><br></p><p>One criticism has appeared in many papers by a man called Sharma. It
is hilarious to see that people don’t even understand the meaning of
their surnames. Sharma comes from sharman, the name of the lowest
brahmin class, who used to butcher cows in their religious rituals.
‘Sharman’ means ‘the butcher’. Still, people go on writing under the
name Sharma, not knowing that they are declaring their butcherhood and
their forefathers’ ugly violence.</p><p><br></p><p>He has been writing against me, that I should not ask for a negative
AIDS test from the Shankaracharya because he is celibate. How does he
know? Just because he is a religious head, that does not mean that he
cannot have AIDS. In fact, there is more possibility of his having AIDS
because he is a celibate and a religious head than there would be in any
other profession.</p><p><br></p><p>It is now a proved fact all over the world that priests have been
found to be homosexuals, and many priests are suffering from AIDS. We
cannot make any exception for anybody. In fact, the Shankaracharya of
Puri has declared himself a harijan. According to his scriptures, he
should not enter into any temple – his own temple included. And if he
enters into any temple, that means that harijans can enter into any
temple around the country.</p><p><br></p><p>People have been deceiving ... that just by changing names<span class=s4></span>All the Hindu scriptures call them</p><p>sudras – untouchables – but now suddenly they have become ‘harijans’
– ‘beloved of God’. And if they are beloved of God, who are all these
other bastards – five billion – in the world? And only God’s beloveds
are not allowed to enter in the temples, and everybody else is
allowed?</p><p><br></p><p>Religion and politics together have been the greatest calamity for
humanity. Not a single politician has spoken against the
Shankaracharya’s statements because they are afraid that if harijans
separate from Hindus – although Hindus have for thousands of years kept
them separate<span class=s4></span>There</p><p>is no need to keep them separate – they are separate. The politician
is worried, not about the temple, not about the scriptures – but because
the harijans have one fourth of the Hindu votes. If they go out of the
Hindu fold, these politicians will be out of power.</p><p><br></p><p>They are completely silent on such an important issue, and rather
than arresting the priests who were preventing harijans from entering
Nath Dwara, the harijans have been arrested. And still these politicians
and priests want harijans to remain part of Hindu society.</p><p>There is a limit to everything. This is too much – too inhuman! They
cannot read Hindu scriptures. They cannot touch Hindus – not even with
their shadow. They cannot remain in the city – they have to live outside
it. They cannot enter into any temple. On what grounds are they called
Hindus?</p><p><br></p><p>And this fellow, Sharma, is blaming me, that I am trying to create a
separation. I am not creating a separation, Sharma; it is you and your
forefathers who have kept the harijans separate. I am trying to bring
them into the temples. And if you want them to be part of your politics,
then forget your scriptures and let them into the temples.</p><p><br></p><p>Even a man like Mahatma Gandhi lied. Although he has written an
autobiography entitled MY EXPERIMENTS WITH THE TRUTH, he obviously does
not know truth; he is still experimenting. And meanwhile he is using so
many lies. He promised that the first president of India after the
British left would be a harijan – and not only a harijan, but a harijan
woman. And as the British Empire disappeared, the person who became
president was neither a harijan nor a woman. The person who became the
prime minister<span class=s4></span>The whole power went into the
hands of those same</p><p>exploiters who had been oppressing this country for centuries. From
the British, it passed into the hands of the old exploiters, and India
remains in slavery.</p><p><br></p><p>Because I am telling the truth, it hurts.</p><p><br></p><p>Mahatma Gandhi used to pray every evening and morning, “God is one.
You can call him Ram, you can call him Allah.” But it was just to keep
the Hindus and Mohammedans together for political reasons. He never
mentioned the KORAN; he always mentioned the GITA and called the GITA
his mother. Although he is dead, I want it to be on record that the
KORAN must therefore be his father.</p><p><br></p><p>His eldest son, Haridas, married a Mohammedan woman, and converted to
Mohammedanism. It was a true test of Mahatma Gandhi’s honesty, his
integrity – and he failed in it. He said to his wife, “Haridas cannot
enter into my house again. And I don’t want to see him even when I die.”
The tradition in India is that when a man dies, his eldest son gives
fire to the funeral pyre. Gandhi’s anger was so much that he willed it
that Haridas would not be allowed to even come near his funeral pyre. He
would be dead, but his anger<span class=s4></span>and the whole world
thinks he was a man of peace; the</p><p>whole world thinks he was a mahatma, a ‘great soul’ – my foot!</p><p><br></p><p>He had said that the country would be divided into India and Pakistan
only over his dead body. But the country was divided with his consent,
and he completely forgot that he had been saying continually: “While I
am alive, the country cannot be divided.” He was the one who was
responsible for dividing the country.</p><p><br></p><p>He was also the one who gave the untouchables the name ‘harijans’.
But he himself never tried to allow harijans their dignity as human
beings, because he could not offend the higher Hindu castes. Harijans
are perhaps the longest-exploited group of people in the world – they
are utterly crushed. But not even the prime minister of India, Rajiv
Gandhi, has spoken against the Shankaracharya. In fact, he will go and
touch his feet just to gain the votes of the high-caste Hindus. Those
two hundred harijans could not have been arrested without Rajiv’s
knowing. It will be good when the Shankaracharya gathers the courage to
come here. Rajiv is also invited – because these politicians and priests
together are the cause of the poverty and the slavery of this country.
But they are interested only in their power. I am not a politician, but
they seem to be very much afraid of me.</p><p>It is a strange story but even Indians coming to the ashram are being
harassed by the police; and these are police sent from Delhi, by the
central government. And Indians are being asked for their passports – in
their own country. It is against the very constitution; it is against
freedom of movement – in your own country you have to carry your
passport! I have never heard such a stupidity happening anywhere in the
world; but India is really a genius in being stupid.</p><p><br></p><p>It is strange that although India is in such poverty, it is wasting
190 million dollars per year on advertising in other countries for
tourists to come to India. And on the other hand, when my people come
here they are harassed in every possible way. And my people are pouring
ten million rupees per day into Poona’s economy. If the government was a
little intelligent, instead of there being seven thousand people here,
there could be one hundred thousand sannyasins from all over the world.
I wanted Poona to be the capital of the world. But because of these
idiots .…</p><p><br></p><p>Rajiv is perfectly aware that it was me who proposed to Indira Gandhi
to train him to be the prime minister. He is taking revenge on me
because he knows I was the person. And he was afraid and Indira said to
me, “What can I do? You try to convince him. He does not want to leave
his service as a pilot in Indian Airlines.”</p><p><br></p><p>And now that he is the prime minister<span class=s4></span>When he
was just a pilot, he was asking again and again to</p><p>come here to see me, to ask my advice. And now he is the person in
power who is trying all around the world, through the Indian embassies,
to refuse to give visas to anybody who is coming to Poona. Poona has
become my personal property!</p><p><br></p><p>I want the whole world to know that if people are harassed because
they are coming to Poona, then no tourist should come to India. Then let
them suffer the whole loss, and stop your Department of Tourism – the
whole ministry is meaningless. They are doing contradictory things: they
invite people to see the relics of Ajanta and Ellora and now they are
advertising very heavily in Japan for the Buddhists to come to Bodhgaya
where Buddha became enlightened. But they are preventing people from
coming here where Buddha is still alive! He is not only alive – he is
ready to impart the same consciousness to anybody who is receptive.
Bodhgaya can have no meaning at all, it is just a graveyard.</p><p><br></p><p>I want my sannyasins to be aware that they should not be in any way
defensive in Indian embassies. Make them aware: “Your government is
inviting us – all these posters and advertisements on the television, on
the radio, in newspapers – and who are you to prevent us?”</p><p><br></p><p>Hundreds of people have been sent back from Indian airports, just on
the suspicion that they may be my sannyasins. Perhaps many may not even
have known my name. A few sannyasins who have come have had to deny that
they know me at all. “Do you want us to know something about Osho before
we can enter India?” They have to give a promise that they are not going
to see Osho. What kind of fear is this? It is the fear of truth; because
politics is the profession of lying, just as priesthood is.</p><p><br></p><p>We have to fight around the world against all kinds of priests and
all kinds of politicians. It is a question of the very survival of
freedom on the earth.</p><p><br></p><p>Maneesha has brought:</p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN GANTO TOOK LEAVE OF TOKUSAN, TOKUSAN SAID, “WHERE ARE YOU
GOING?”</p><p><br></p><p>GANTO SAID, “FOR NOW I AM TAKING LEAVE OF YOU, MASTER, AND GOING DOWN
THE MOUNTAIN.”</p><p><br></p><p>TOKUSAN SAID, “AFTER THAT, THEN WHAT?” GANTO SAID, “I WON’T FORGET
YOU, MASTER.” “BY VIRTUE OF WHAT DO YOU SAY THIS?” INQUIRED TOKUSAN.</p><p>GANTO SAID, “HAVEN’T YOU HEARD THAT WHEN A MONK’S KNOWLEDGE IS EQUAL
TO HIS TEACHER’S, HE HAS LESS THAN HALF HIS TEACHER’S VIRTUE; WHEN HIS
KNOWLEDGE SURPASSES THE TEACHER’S, ONLY THEN IS HE QUALIFIED FOR THE
TRANSMISSION?”</p><p><br></p><p>TOKUSAN SAID, “SO IT IS, SO IT IS. GUARD IT WELL ON YOUR OWN.”</p><p><br></p><p>In translation, the most significant part is always lost. Tokusan is
a great master. Ganto was a student, not even a disciple, because a
disciple never takes leave of the master. A disciple becomes almost a
part of the very being of the master. There arises an invisible
connection between the two hearts. They dance together.</p><p><br></p><p>But Ganto must have been just a student, collecting knowledge from
this master, from that master. He was not even aware of the distinction
between the teacher and the master, nor about the distinction between
the disciple and the student. A student is concerned with knowledge, a
disciple is concerned with being; he just wants to be at the highest
peak of his own potentiality. He does not want to carry scriptures
unnecessarily on his back, he wants the lotus to blossom within his own
being. A disciple is not a student. A disciple is a lover. The student
is only collecting knowledge.</p><p><br></p><p>TOKUSAN SAID, “WHERE ARE YOU GOING? If you are really a disciple,
there is no going, no coming anymore, because you have found the
catalytic agent which is going to transform your being. But if you are
going, at least I can ask you where.” It is out of compassion that
Tokusan is saying to Ganto, “Please understand: going away from here is
going away from yourself. By accident, you have come very close to the
explosion, so where are you going now? When spring is about to come, you
are going? When the flowers are going to blossom in all their colors,
you are going? Where are you going?”</p><p><br></p><p>Ganto could not understand. A student is very poor as far as
existential experience is concerned.</p><p><br></p><p>GANTO SAID, “FOR NOW I AM TAKING LEAVE OF YOU, MASTER, AND GOING DOWN
THE MOUNTAIN.”</p><p><br></p><p>He does not know the difference between master and teacher; he has no
right to call Tokusan ‘master’. In the dictionary it means the same
thing, but life is not a dictionary. The master is one</p><p>who can transmit his being to you, who can – just by being present –
create a situation in which you become a fire. The teacher can only talk
about what the scriptures say. The master is a presence, a silence. Even
in his words, he is trying to help you to move towards the wordless.</p><p><br></p><p>But Ganto was in sheer confusion. He said, “FOR NOW I AM TAKING LEAVE
OF YOU, MASTER</p><p>...”</p><p><br></p><p>If I had been in the place of Tokusan, I would have ordered Sardar
Gurudayal Singh to take care of this fellow Ganto, to hit him three
times. He cannot use the word ‘master’, he is making it synonymous with
‘teacher’.</p><p><br></p><p>” ... AND GOING DOWN THE MOUNTAIN.” TOKUSAN SAID, “AFTER THAT, THEN
WHAT?</p><p><br></p><p>What will you do down the mountain? From THERE, WHERE ARE YOU
GOING?“GANTO SAID,”I WON’T FORGET YOU, MASTER.” There is no question of
forgetting the master. The disciple carries the master in his heart, not
in his memory. He is carrying the same flame within him, not in his
thoughts.</p><p><br></p><p>GANTO SAID, “I WON’T FORGET YOU, MASTER.”</p><p><br></p><p>Again and again, it is becoming clearer that he is simply a
student.</p><p><br></p><p>Tokusan asked him, “BY VIRTUE OF WHAT DO YOU SAY THIS?” He is saying,
“You have not even known me. On what grounds are you saying that you
will not forget me? How can you forget someone you have not known
either? Before you can forget, the basic requirement is at least to
know. By what virtue are you saying this?”</p><p><br></p><p>GANTO SAID, – and this is a quotation from ancient Buddhist
scriptures – “HAVEN’T YOU HEARD THAT WHEN A MONK’S KNOWLEDGE IS EQUAL TO
HIS TEACHER’S, HE HAS LESS THAN HALF HIS TEACHER’S VIRTUE; WHEN HIS
KNOWLEDGE SURPASSES THE TEACHER’S, ONLY THEN IS HE QUALIFIED FOR THE
TRANSMISSION?”</p><p><br></p><p>He does not understand what he is talking about. This statement in
the Buddhist scriptures has nothing to do with knowledge; it has
something to do with knowing. That’s how things change their color in
translations. Knowing is an existential thing, knowledge is just memory.
Even a computer has knowledge because it has memory. By memorizing
scriptures, you don’t prove your intelligence, you only prove that you
are a good computer.</p><p><br></p><p>The scriptures certainly say this, “If the disciple’s knowing is even
half of his master’s knowing, he also has half the virtue that his
master has. But if his knowing surpasses the teacher’s, only then is he
qualified for the transmission.”</p><p><br></p><p>In the translation, everything has become topsy-turvy. You cannot
surpass the master’s knowing because the master in the ultimate sense
knows nothing. How can you surpass nothing – do you think there is any
possibility? Something can be surpassed, but nothing cannot be
surpassed. Nothing is vast and limitless, how can you surpass it?</p><p>But Tokusan is one of the great compassionate teachers. Rather than
hitting Ganto, out of compassion he simply says, “Yes. It is so, SO IT
IS. GUARD IT WELL ON YOUR OWN. I take back my responsibility for you,
now you are on your own, be on guard.” In fact what he is saying is,
“Now I am no more concerned with you. You are breaking all the bridges
between you and me. Whatever you think, whatever you have understood,
guard it well and be on your own.”</p><p><br></p><p>No master can force anybody to be enlightened. No master can create a
fetter for the disciple. No master will say, “Remain with me.” It is the
disciple’s heart that wants to remain. It is not an order from the side
of the master, it is the love from the side of the disciple. It is a
great love affair, ‘the great matter’. You can understand it because you
are not students and this is not a university. This is simply a
gathering of seekers who have fallen in love with a master, who have
recognized in their deepest heart that this is the place where they
belong.</p><p><br></p><p>But it is not an order. From my side, you are absolutely free. If
nobody comes here, I will still come every evening to talk to the
bamboos. It is your decision to be here or not to be here. But Tokusan
is compassionate, saying that, “If you are leaving, then just be on
guard. You can go astray very easily. You have not understood
anything.”</p><p><br></p><p>A haiku by Boryu:</p><p><br></p><p>CLOUD ABOVE LOTUS – IT TOO</p><p>BECOMES A BUDDHA.</p><p><br></p><p>I love this haiku particularly for this series. It is dedicated to
the clouds. CLOUD ABOVE LOTUS – IT TOO BECOMES A BUDDHA. To be a buddha
is everybody’s right. If you don’t claim it, it is only your fault.
Recognize it and live it and you will be suddenly surprised that
everything in your life is changing – just from the recognition that
your inner being is already a buddha, already awakened. But you have not
taken care.</p><p><br></p><p>The English word ‘ignorance’ is beautiful, but not in the sense that
it is usually understood. To me it means ignoring your buddhahood. That
is ignorance, the only ignorance. Ignoring your buddhahood – the only
ignorance; knowing your buddhahood – the only knowledge.</p><p><br></p><p>Saigyo’s verse runs:</p><p><br></p><p>WHAT IT IS</p><p><br></p><p>I KNOW NOT;</p><p><br></p><p>BUT WITH GRATITUDE MY TEARS FALL.</p><p>Just today, Leela has sent a question to me: “People who are doing
the Mystic Rose meditation in the third stage, the watcher on the hills
– many start feeling tears coming for no reason at all. What has to be
done about it?”</p><p>Leela, nothing has to be done about it. This is simply beautiful.
These tears are not of pain. These tears of people in silence are of
gratitude. These are just flowers, they are pouring unto the feet of
existence itself. Rejoice in their tears. Remember this saying of Saigyo
– a great master – WHAT IT IS, I KNOW NOT; BUT WITH GRATITUDE MY TEARS
FALL.</p><p><br></p><p>Maneesha has asked:</p><p><br></p><p>BELOVED OSHO, THE UNSURPASSABLE MAN,</p><p><br></p><p>WOULD YOU AGREE THAT YOUR DISCIPLES WILL HAVE ONLY PROVED THEMSELVES
WHEN THEY SURPASS YOU? OR DO WE NEED ONLY TO SURPASS OURSELVES?</p><p><br></p><p>The moment, Maneesha, you surpass yourself ... then there is no you
and no I. When the disciple surpasses himself, there is a great meeting
of consciousnesses; just as when lovers meet, it is at a lower status, a
meeting of bodies. The master and disciple meet at the highest altitude
– as pure consciousnesses, as two clouds merging into each other. There
is no question of surpassing the master, because when you have surpassed
yourself, you will not find any master, you will not find any disciple.
You will find only a pure consciousness which is one.</p><p><br></p><p>Before we enter into this one consciousness, a few small laughters,
just to make the journey a little light.</p><p><br></p><p>Old Mrs. Bathead and Mrs. Kooch meet on holiday and are sitting on
the porch of their Catskill Mountain hotel.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh my God!” exclaims Mrs. Bathead. “Look at that boy. Did you ever
see such a big twisted nose? And such a huge crooked mouth? And look –
he is cross-eyed too!”</p><p><br></p><p>“That,” says Mrs. Kooch, “happens to be my son.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well,” says Mrs. Bathead, “on him, it looks very becoming.”</p><p><br></p><p>Kowalski and Nurdski stagger out of the bar, stumble over to a
lamppost, unzip, take things in hand and start to pee.</p><p><br></p><p>A cop sees them standing there, walks over and says, “Hey, you two!
Put those things away and stop what you are doing. Where do you think
you are, India?”</p><p><br></p><p>The two Polacks zip up their pants obediently. But when the cop has
gone, Kowalski starts to laugh. “What is so funny?” asks Nurdski.</p><p>“I fooled that cop,” says Kowalski, “I put it away, but I didn’t
stop!” Jemima and Beulah are hanging out on the front porch.</p><p>“Did you hear about Mrs. Berrypatch having quadruplets?” says
Jemima.</p><p>“Well what the hell are they?” cries Beulah.</p><p><br></p><p>“Dumb cluck!” says Jemima. “That’s when you have four babies in one
go. And I heard that it only happens once every sixty thousand
times!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Glory Jeezus!” howls Beulah. “When the hell does that woman ever get
her housework done?”</p><p><br></p><p>In this insane world, a few minutes of sanity now. Nivedano, give the

beginning and without any end.</p><p>It is a journey of dances</p><p><br></p><p>and songs and music and poetry, a festive journey,</p><p>a ceremony without any reason. Just being is enough.</p><p>At this moment, you make this place the holiest place in the
world.</p><p>So many buddhas, so many people</p><p>centered in their being,</p><p><br></p><p>the whole garden is full of roses. Drink it deep.</p><p>It is the very juice of your immortality. Nivedano ... call all the
buddhas back. (Drumbeat)</p><p>Sit down for few moments, remembering,</p><p>rejoicing,</p><p><br></p><p>recollecting where you have been. Keep on guard twenty-four hours.
Remain a buddha,</p><p>alert, aware, joyous;</p><p><br></p><p>so blissful that even others</p><p><br></p><p>can start feeling your blissfulness. Okay, Maneesha?</p><p>Yes, Osho.</p><p><br></p><p>Can we celebrate the meeting of so many buddhas? Yes, Osho.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part6>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

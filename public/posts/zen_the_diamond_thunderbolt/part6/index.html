WEARING THIS ROBE, TO FAIL TO UNDERSTAND THE GREAT MATTER – THAT LOSS IS MOST PAINFUL.”\nADDRESSING HIS MONKS, DOYO SAID, “YOU ARE ALREADY WITHIN THIS TRADITION. A HUNDRED PERCENT IS NOT FAR FROM NINETY PERCENT. YOU SHOULD EXERT A LITTLE MORE ENERGY. THEN YOU ELDERS WILL NOT TIRE OF YOUR PERPETUAL JOURNEY AND YET WILL NOT TURN AWAY FROM THE MONASTERY.”\nHE CONTINUED: “AN ANCIENT HAS SAID, ‘IF YOU WISH TO BE ABLE TO BEAR THIS MATTER, YOU MUST GO AND STAND ATOP THE HIGHEST MOUNTAIN, AND WALK ON THE BOTTOM OF THE DEEPEST SEA. ONLY THEN HAVE YOU SOME POWER.’”\nDOYO SAID, “IF YOU HAVE NOT YET TAKEN CARE OF THE GREAT MATTER, FOR NOW YOU MUST TREAD THE HIDDEN ROAD.”\nA MONK THEN ASKED, “WHAT IS ESTEEMED BY AN ASCETIC?” DOYO SAID, “WHERE MIND’S CONSCIOUSNESS DOES NOT REACH.”\nANOTHER MONK ASKED, “WHAT ARE THE GRADES OF BUDDHAS AND PATRIARCHS?”\nDOYO SAID, “BOTH ARE GRADES.”\nA THIRD MONK ASKED, “WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THE COMING OF BODHIDHARMA FROM THE WEST?”\nDOYO SAID, “MEETING NO ONE ON THE ANCIENT ROAD.”\nManeesha, the Western approach and the Eastern approach to the understanding of reality have been diametrically opposite. The West has believed in the body, in the outside world, in matter. Therefore a great science has arisen out of it, with all its branches: physics, chemistry, medicine. But the basic thing is that it denies the inner reality of man.\nAnd the East is focused, totally and unconditionally, on the search for the inner: “Who is residing within me?” The body has always been taken just as a house, or like the clothes you wear. You are not your clothes and you are not your body, you are not even your mind. What is left? – an utter silence. In this silence have arisen heights of consciousness like that of Gautam Buddha, and these heights are not unavailable to others. They are available to you and to everybody else, whoever is ready enough to take just a little turn – from the outside to the inside. These anecdotes are concerned with this turning point.\nONE DAY, UNGO DOYO WENT UP INTO THE HALL AND QUOTED TOZAN’S OLD SAYING, “HELL IS NOT REALLY PAINFUL. WEARING THIS ROBE, TO FAIL TO UNDERSTAND THE GREAT MATTER – THAT LOSS IS MOST PAINFUL.”\nNow you have to understand the symbols and the metaphors of Zen. HELL IS NOT REALLY PAINFUL because there is no hell other than being outside yourself, and there is no heaven other than being within yourself. Hell and heaven are both just metaphors; they do not denote any reality.\nAll the religions have made much fuss about them. Their whole exploitation of man depends on two things: fear of hell and greed for heaven. It is such a contradiction that all these religions go on teaching against fear, against greed, but underneath, their whole teaching is based on the fear of hell. If you are not virtuous, if you are not a believer, you will fall into eternal hell; you will be tortured for eternity. If you are a believer, a faithful, virtuous, respectable person, then the doors of heaven are open for you.\nIt is a contradiction because hell is only a metaphor for fear, and heaven is another metaphor for greed, for lust. Zen does not consider them to be of any significance at all.\nThat’s why Tozan says, “HELL IS NOT REALLY PAINFUL.” Don’t be bothered about hell. The real pain is that you are wearing the robe of a monk, a sannyasin; you have declared yourself as a seeker of truth, but still you are not going withinwards, you have not yet found the way. And your inner world is not very far away.\nThis turning in is called ‘the great matter’. “WEARING THIS ROBE, TO FAIL TO UNDERSTAND THE GREAT MATTER” Science is only trying to understand matter – what about the great matter?\nWhat about the scientist himself? Albert Einstein may have discovered great things about matter, but what about himself? He knows nothing at all. He has never even thought that there is another\nuniverse waiting to be explored – and it is the real universe. The outer will be lost with your death, but the inner will continue. The inner is your ultimate pilgrimage. Hence it is right to call it the great matter – the great and ultimate concern.\nThis is the most painful thing, according to Tozan: that your paradise is so close and yet you go on missing it. Your buddhahood is just a question of opening your eyes. If you can become just a little more alert than you are, a little more conscious, you will enter into the timeless reality of existence. Its splendor is great – it has no beginning and no end.\nThis is the most painful part for anyone who has realized his own self – he can see millions of people in suffering. What is there in the world except suffering, except misery, except pain? Every pleasure turns into pain and all your joy is so superficial – it is not even skin deep. It can be disturbed by a single word uttered against you – that is the depth of your joy.\nWhat are your riches? They will all be taken away. What are your possessions? You have come into the world naked, and naked you will have to go out of it. If you don’t search for who it is who comes and goes, but just become involved in the non-essentials of life – this is the greatest pain possible. To live and yet to miss the source of life; to live only superficially, never going into the depths of your being or the heights of your consciousness; to just remain mundane – this is the most painful thing according to the Eastern approach. And I absolutely agree with it.\nADDRESSING HIS MONKS, DOYO SAID, “YOU ARE ALREADY WITHIN THIS TRADITION. A HUNDRED PERCENT IS NOT FAR FROM NINETY PERCENT.”\nYou are already ninety percent a buddha; and a hundred percent is not far away. But remember one thing – that even ninety-nine percent will not be close enough. Even ninety-nine-point-nine percent will still be distant. You have to be a hundred percent here and now at the very center of your being, and suddenly there arises within you a new, fresh, eternal consciousness that knows nothing of pain, nothing of death; it knows no beginning and no end. Your potential has blossomed into a lotus.\nYou must have seen Gautam Buddha’s statues: he is sitting on a lotus. That lotus is symbolic of the blossoming of consciousness to its ultimate possibility and potentiality.\n“A HUNDRED PERCENT IS NOT FAR FROM NINETY PERCENT. YOU SHOULD EXERT A LITTLE MORE ENERGY. THEN YOU ELDERS WILL NOT TIRE OF YOUR PERPETUAL JOURNEY AND YET WILL NOT TURN AWAY FROM THE MONASTERY.”\nThere is a Tibetan saying, that a hundred persons start to seek the truth, and perhaps only one reaches it. Ninety-nine get lost somewhere on the way. They either become involved in some other business or they go astray. There are thousands of ways of going astray and there is only one way of going into yourself.\nJust a single inch’s difference and you are lost; you will not find yourself. Every thought is trying to take you astray. Every feeling, every sentiment – all the qualities of your mind are enemies as far as the discovery of your center is concerned, because they are all pushing you forward, outward: “Become a success, become prestigious, be more powerful.” And your inner being remains starving. You go on pouring your energy into the outside world, which is not really your home, and your real\nbeing is starving inside, waiting, for hundreds of lives. It is hoping that one day you will turn back, wondering how long you can go on missing.\nI am reminded of a great king who was a lover of archery. He himself was an adept, a master of archery. He was passing through a village and he saw, on every tree, an arrow stuck exactly in the middle of a circle. He could not believe his eyes, that in this village lives such a great archer.\nHe stopped his chariot and asked the people, “Who is this master archer?” They laughed and said, “Don’t bother about him; he is the village idiot.”\nThe king said, “Whoever he is, he is a great archer.”\nThe villagers said, “You don’t understand his strategy. First he shoots the arrow and then he makes a circle round it.” Obviously, he is a hundred percent successful; he never fails.\nIn the inside world, you cannot deceive anyone in such a way. You know your center and then you simply become radiant and fragrant, a dance unto yourself. If you don’t know it, you may pretend that you are happy, but it is all hypocrisy.\nHave you ever thought about all the stories that end up with the marriage of the hero and the heroine, with the sentence, “Afterwards they lived happily”? Afterwards! In every story ... you cannot find a single story in which this “afterwards they lived happily” does not appear; but it is because afterwards is the hell, it is better not to talk about it. All the pleasure is before the marriage; by the time the honeymoon ends, everything is finished. You will be fortunate if your love can survive the honeymoon – two weeks is too much! Two weeks together, just exploring the same geography .…\n(SARDAR GURUDAYAL SINGH GIVES A HEARTY LAUGH, THEN EVERYONE ELSE LAUGHS.)\nLook! You cannot defeat Sardar. He is really a nice fellow. He has lived many honeymoons; he is not laughing out of ignorance – he knows it!\nOne becomes fed up. Just to ask human beings to be together more than two weeks is absolutely inhuman, because then comes misery and suffering; and this misery and suffering is perpetuated by all the churches and the religions. Because if there is no misery and no suffering, who is going to go to the churches? The fellows you find in churches are those who are suffering and asking God, “Why you are so hard on me? Could not you give this woman to somebody else?”\nAn old Jew was dying on the road after an accident. A Catholic priest, passing by, went near to the old man out of great Catholic mercy, and said, “Remember God, his only begotten son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost.”\nThe Jew opened his eyes and said, “At least at the time of my death, don’t give me any riddle. Death is enough – now don’t torture me with riddles. God, the only begotten son, and the Holy Ghost ...?”\nBut the priest said, “You were praying – I saw your lips moving.”\nHe said, “Yes, I am praying. I am saying, ‘God, for four thousand years we have been your chosen people and we have suffered enough. Now you should choose somebody else.’”\nEverybody is suffering more from his friends than from his enemies, because nobody marries enemies. Marriage is a contract between potential enemies. Within two weeks everything will be clear. But then the religions force people to remain together: “Suffer, be miserable, and pray to God.” But by the way, God exists not, so all your prayers are just going into the empty sky – there is no one to respond.\nBut everybody in the world is living in all kinds of miseries; and they have chosen those miseries.\nThere is an ancient parable in India about a very rich man, very successful; he was so rich that even the king had to borrow money from him. He had everything that was possible, but he was always very sad and miserable, always a long face. A young man used to come every day to give him massage, who was always happy. He had nothing to be happy about – and that was the problem for the rich man. The poor fellow got one rupee per day. In those days, a rupee was really a rupee. The word ‘rupee’ means ‘gold’. One rupee was enough for one day, to live happily. That poor man was not poor – he was living so joyously, and playing on his flute in the middle of the night.\nThe rich man was worried because this fellow had nothing except one rupee every day. “Why is he always so happy, so smiling, so laughing, playing on his flute, singing, dancing?” The poor man lived close by, in a small room that the rich man had provided for him.\nThe rich man asked his friend, who was as rich as he was, “What could be the reason for this poor fellow’s being so happy?”\nHis friend said, “I will give you the answer.” And that night, suddenly, the poor fellow woke up. Somebody had thrown a bag from the roof containing ninety-nine rupees. That was the last day of his happiness. Now he started to think, “How can I save some money and make it at least a hundred?” He had never bothered – one rupee per day was enough to live as richly as he wanted. But now he had more than he could use for the day; he had to save. When it became one hundred, the desire jumped up, flared up. If he went on collecting, soon he would have two hundred, three hundred, four hundred. And as more and more money started accumulating, he became more and more miserable, continuously thinking of money. The song disappeared, the dance disappeared; the flute was heard no more.\nOne day when the rich man was being massaged, he asked him, “What has happened to you? You don’t look happy any more. Has some calamity happened?”\nHe said, “Yes, a calamity has happened. Somebody threw ninety-nine rupees into my house, and since that day I have not slept well, because the desire to have more and more has been aroused.”\nOnce you have the desire for more of anything, life is misery. It may be knowledge, it may be money, it may be power; you may start desiring anything, but you will become more and more sad. It is such a difficult world .…\nThe prime minister of the country was visiting a psychiatric hospital, and the superintendent of the hospital was explaining to him about every inmate. One man was just crying and crying and beating his head against the wall.\nThe prime minister asked, “What is the matter? What happened to this poor fellow?”\nHe said, “He used to love a woman but could not get married to her. His suffering is intense.”\nAnd in the next room, another man was doing the same act – beating his head, tearing his hair. The prime minister said, “What happened to him?”\nThe superintendent laughed. He said, “He married that same woman.”\nMisery is bound to be there whether you marry the woman or you don’t marry the woman, or the man; whether you go into this profession or into that profession. Everywhere you will find yourself miserable, because always you want more, and life is fleeting. Moment to moment, death is coming closer, and you have not achieved your goal.\nOutside there is nothing but misery. We can try to put on masks, we can try to smile, but in fact we want to weep.\nFriedrich Nietzsche has written exactly that sentence: “Don’t be fooled by my smiles; I smile only when I want to hide my tears. I don’t want to expose my wounds to anyone – it is so humiliating.”\nAnd it becomes even more painful to see how close is the door of your paradise – you are carrying it. A Sufi story makes it clear:\nMulla Nasruddin was carrying the door of his house. Somebody asked, “What are you doing?” He said, “I am going into another town for some work.”\nThey said, “You can go, but why are you carrying this door?”\nHe said, “You are absolutely unintelligent. If there is no door to my house, how can any thief enter? I always take my door with me.”\nIt is a Sufi way of saying that the door of your paradise is not somewhere beyond the clouds; it is right within you. And except you, nobody else can enter into it.\nHE CONTINUED: “AN ANCIENT HAS SAID, ‘IF YOU WISH TO BE ABLE TO BEAR THIS MATTER, YOU MUST GO AND STAND ATOP THE HIGHEST MOUNTAIN, AND WALK ON THE BOTTOM OF THE DEEPEST SEA. ONLY THEN HAVE YOU SOME POWER.’”\nIt looks contradictory: how can you manage to be on the highest top of a mountain, and at the same time at the deepest depth of the ocean? But inside it is not a contradiction, because on the inside the highest point of your consciousness is also the deepest point. It is as high as any Everest, and it is as deep as any Pacific; it is both together. And unless you have found this, you don’t have any power – you are just a miserable creature. You don’t have even yourself, what to say about power?\nDOYO SAID, “IF YOU HAVE NOT YET TAKEN CARE OF THE GREAT MATTER, FOR NOW YOU MUST TREAD THE HIDDEN ROAD.”\nThe road, of course, is hidden, because it is not outside, like a highway; it is an absolutely private footpath inwards where nobody has ever traveled. You make it yourself at the same time as you\nmove inside; it is not ready-made – because nobody else can enter within you, only you can go there. But it is a question only of a single step – the journey is not long. The moment you close your eyes and start looking inwards, suddenly you are amazed that this is what you have been seeking for many lives, and it is hidden just inside you. The road is hidden, but it is not long – just a single step.\nA MONK THEN ASKED, “WHAT IS ESTEEMED BY AN ASCETIC?” DOYO SAID, “WHERE MIND’S CONSCIOUSNESS DOES NOT REACH.”\nYou must have heard the definition of an ascetic. In Zen they are not accepted, but in other religions the ascetic is one who tortures himself as a sacrifice to get God’s blessings; he becomes a sacrificial lamb. He hungers, he starves himself, he beats his body; he remains naked in winter, in summer. By an ascetic is meant somebody who sacrifices his body and bodily pleasures in search of God.\nZen has a totally different approach, because this kind of ascetic is simply a psychological case; it is nothing to do with religion. How, even if God is there, will he be made happy by your starvation? By torturing yourself you are simply proving that you are a masochist, that you enjoy torturing yourself.\nIt is said that the perfect marriage is between a masochist and a sadist. A sadist is one who loves to torture and the masochist is one who loves to be tortured; it is the perfect marriage. But it is very difficult to find any perfection in this world; just once in a while it happens.\nAll the religions have been teaching psychological sickness to people. Zen has nothing to do with any psychological sickness, because it is not an exploitation of your sickness – it is a sharing of joy and it brings you to your wholeness and health.\nIt even defines the word ‘ascetic’ as “WHERE MIND’S CONSCIOUSNESS DOES NOT REACH” – that which is beyond mind, where no thought can reach, but only pure silence, serenity. In that silence, in that meditative state, you achieve your own innermost treasure.\nANOTHER MONK ASKED, “WHAT ARE THE GRADES OF BUDDHAS AND PATRIARCHS?”\nOur mind always thinks in grades, in hierarchies, in bureaucracies: who is higher, who is lower. But the moment you transcend the mind you also transcend this tendency to categorize. Then whether you call the man who has gone beyond ‘the buddha’ or ‘the enlightened one’ or ‘the awakened one’\n.… You can call him ‘the master’ or ‘the patriarch’ but there is no difference in their consciousnesses. They have all done a single thing – they have left their mind and body behind and they have just centered their wholeness within, unmoving. This is the greatest blessing that is possible for a man. In this moment you become a buddha, a god, yourself.\nRemember the difference: other religions are trying to pray to God; Zen is trying to discover God in you.\nThere is no other God than your pure consciousness, and your pure consciousness is not yours; it is simply consciousness. It covers every other consciousness, it joins hands with the universal consciousness. You disappear like a dewdrop – the ocean remains. But this disappearance in the ocean is such a benediction, it is the only benediction there is.\nA THIRD MONK ASKED, “WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THE COMING OF BODHIDHARMA FROM THE WEST?”\nThese are traditional Zen questions.\nDOYO SAID, “MEETING NO ONE ON THE ANCIENT ROAD.”\nThese small questions had been answered thousands of times by different masters in different ways, but they always brought a new light to it. Now Doyo is bringing a tremendous new insight: that Bodhidharma came to China from India, but wanted to meet no one; he wanted to meet someone whose ego had died, who was no more a personality but just a presence, a fragrance. This is MEETING NO ONE ON THE ANCIENT ROAD. All the buddhas have been moving in search of those who are ready to disappear into the ocean.\nThis is what we are doing here: trying in every possible way to put aside the mind that is given by the society, and to bring our innocence – the gift of nature – and disappear into the silence of the sky and the trees.\nIf your thoughts stop, you stop; then what remains is the divine dance of consciousness. Hakuin has written a small poem:\nYOU NO SOONER ATTAIN THE GREAT VOID THAN BODY AND MIND ARE LOST TOGETHER. HEAVEN AND HELL – A STRAW.\nTHE BUDDHA-REALM, PANDEMONIUM – SHAMBLES. LISTEN: A NIGHTINGALE STRAINS HER VOICE, SERENADING THE SNOW.\nLOOK: A TORTOISE WEARING A SWORD CLIMBS THE LAMPSTAND.\nSHOULD YOU DESIRE THE GREAT TRANQUILITY, PREPARE TO SWEAT WHITE BEADS.\nThese small poems stress a single point: that you have to be so receptive – with no obstruction to your eyes, to your ears, to your sensitivity – that the whole of life becomes a music, a poetry. Then everything starts looking different: the green is greener, the rose is rosier. It is the same song, but with a new meaning, a new significance; the same mirror, but there is no longer any dust gathered on it.\nManeesha has asked:\nBELOVED OSHO,\nI DO NOT FEEL THE PAIN OF BEING A DISCIPLE AND NOT UNDERSTANDING ENLIGHTENMENT, AS I DO THE HELL OF THOSE TIMES OF BEING CLOSED TO YOU.\nIN FACT, I SEEM TO ONLY BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND ANYTHING AT ALL IN THE CONTEXT OF YOU, THE MASTER. YOU ARE MY FRAMEWORK, MY TOUCHSTONE. IS THAT OKAY?\nManeesha, absolutely okay – not only for you, but for every buddha who is present here. These seven thousand buddhas are here just to be awakened, and to look into my awakening as a touchstone.\nBefore we enter into our inner doors, a little laughter will be helpful, just to dust and cleanse your mind.\nTwo madmen, Goonski and Nutzo, are standing in a field within the grounds of the asylum. They are gazing in silence at a beautiful sunset when Goonski says with delight, “Oh wow!”\n“Oh yes,” replies Nutzo. “Really wow, oh, wow!”\nAfter a while, Nutzo turns to Goonski and says, “You know, for a show like this, these guys must have spent plenty of money; but they won’t even give us three dollars to go and see the gorillas in the zoo!”\nHenry and Morris are partners in a tailors shop in New York. One summer, Henry goes on his first hunting trip. When he gets back to the shop afterwards, Morris cannot wait to hear all about it.\n“Well,” begins Henry, “I go into the woods with the guide, but you know me, within five minutes I get lost. So I’m walking around in the woods, not knowing where I am, when all of a sudden I come face to face with the biggest goddamn bear you have ever seen. I turn around and run as fast as I can, but the bear is running faster.\n“Just when I feel his hot breath on my neck, he slips and falls. I keep running, but the bear is catching up again. He is almost on top of me when he slips and falls again. Then I run into a clearing, with the bear close behind, and I see the other hunters and shout for help. Just then the bear slips and falls again, and the guide is able to shoot and kill him.”\n“Wow!” says Morris. “That is quite a story. You are a very brave man. If that had been me, I would have shit in my pants!”\n“Use your brain, Morris,” snaps Henry. “What do you think the bear was slipping on?”\nThe distraught young man is perched on the ledge, forty floors up, and he is threatening to jump. The police are pleading with him to return to safety, but he seems determined to commit suicide. A priest is called from the nearby church, and he hurries to the scene.\n“Think, my son,” he intones to the young man. “Think of your mother and father who love you.” “They don’t love me,” shouts the man, “I’m jumping!”\n“No, stop!” cries the priest. “Think of the woman who loves you!” “Nobody loves me! I’m jumping!” he shouts back.\n“But think,” the priest begs, “think of Jesus, Mary, and Joseph who love you!” “Jesus, Mary, and Joseph?” cries the man. “Who the hell are they?”\nAt which point the priest throws down his bible and screams back, “Jump, you Jew, jump!” Now, Nivedano ... give a good beat and everybody goes crazy.\n(Drumbeat) (Gibberish) Nivedano ... (Drumbeat)\nBe silent. Close your eyes. Feel as if your body is frozen. Gather your energy inwards.\nTravel this ancient path to your own center.\nDeeper, deeper, deeper; and as you go deep, you start feeling\na totally different dimension opening within you.\nThis is the great matter;\nthe door to the kingdom of God.\nGod is within you.\nOther than this,\nthere is no God anywhere.\nTo make it absolutely clear, Nivedano ... (Drumbeat)\nRelax. Let go. Completely die,\nas far as your body and mind is concerned. Just feel the beyond; it is your home.\nThis beyond opens\nthe lotus of your being. This beyond makes you a buddha.\nIn a lightning moment,\nsuddenly you are no more ordinary – you have become a sacred mountain.\nSimultaneously\nat the top of a great mountain\nand in the depths of a great ocean ... where these two meet,\nthis is your very center.\nThis is the center of the cyclone. Nivedano ...\n(Drumbeat)\nCall all the buddhas back.\nSit down for a few moments\nto realize and recognize where you have been.

SAYING, “HELL IS NOT REALLY PAINFUL. WEARING THIS ROBE, TO FAIL TO
UNDERSTAND THE GREAT MATTER – THAT LOSS IS MOST PAINFUL.”</p><p><br></p><p>ADDRESSING HIS MONKS, DOYO SAID, “YOU ARE ALREADY WITHIN THIS

THIS MATTER, YOU MUST GO AND STAND ATOP THE HIGHEST MOUNTAIN, AND WALK
ON THE BOTTOM OF THE DEEPEST SEA. ONLY THEN HAVE YOU SOME POWER.’”</p><p><br></p><p>DOYO SAID, “IF YOU HAVE NOT YET TAKEN CARE OF THE GREAT MATTER, FOR
NOW YOU MUST TREAD THE HIDDEN ROAD.”</p><p><br></p><p>A MONK THEN ASKED, “WHAT IS ESTEEMED BY AN ASCETIC?” DOYO SAID,
“WHERE MIND’S CONSCIOUSNESS DOES NOT REACH.”</p><p>ANOTHER MONK ASKED, “WHAT ARE THE GRADES OF BUDDHAS AND
PATRIARCHS?”</p><p>DOYO SAID, “BOTH ARE GRADES.”</p><p><br></p><p>A THIRD MONK ASKED, “WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THE COMING OF BODHIDHARMA
FROM THE WEST?”</p><p><br></p><p>DOYO SAID, “MEETING NO ONE ON THE ANCIENT ROAD.”</p><p><br></p><p>Maneesha, the Western approach and the Eastern approach to the
understanding of reality have been diametrically opposite. The West has
believed in the body, in the outside world, in matter. Therefore a great
science has arisen out of it, with all its branches: physics, chemistry,
medicine. But the basic thing is that it denies the inner reality of
man.</p><p><br></p><p>And the East is focused, totally and unconditionally, on the search
for the inner: “Who is residing within me?” The body has always been
taken just as a house, or like the clothes you wear. You are not your
clothes and you are not your body, you are not even your mind. What is
left? – an utter silence. In this silence have arisen heights of
consciousness like that of Gautam Buddha, and these heights are not
unavailable to others. They are available to you and to everybody else,
whoever is ready enough to take just a little turn – from the outside to
the inside. These anecdotes are concerned with this turning point.</p><p><br></p><p>ONE DAY, UNGO DOYO WENT UP INTO THE HALL AND QUOTED TOZAN’S OLD
SAYING, “HELL IS NOT REALLY PAINFUL. WEARING THIS ROBE, TO FAIL TO
UNDERSTAND THE GREAT MATTER – THAT LOSS IS MOST PAINFUL.”</p><p><br></p><p>Now you have to understand the symbols and the metaphors of Zen. HELL
IS NOT REALLY PAINFUL because there is no hell other than being outside
yourself, and there is no heaven other than being within yourself. Hell
and heaven are both just metaphors; they do not denote any reality.</p><p><br></p><p>All the religions have made much fuss about them. Their whole
exploitation of man depends on two things: fear of hell and greed for
heaven. It is such a contradiction that all these religions go on
teaching against fear, against greed, but underneath, their whole
teaching is based on the fear of hell. If you are not virtuous, if you
are not a believer, you will fall into eternal hell; you will be
tortured for eternity. If you are a believer, a faithful, virtuous,
respectable person, then the doors of heaven are open for you.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a contradiction because hell is only a metaphor for fear, and
heaven is another metaphor for greed, for lust. Zen does not consider
them to be of any significance at all.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why Tozan says, “HELL IS NOT REALLY PAINFUL.” Don’t be
bothered about hell. The real pain is that you are wearing the robe of a
monk, a sannyasin; you have declared yourself as a seeker of truth, but
still you are not going withinwards, you have not yet found the way. And
your inner world is not very far away.</p><p><br></p><p>This turning in is called ‘the great matter’. “WEARING THIS ROBE, TO
FAIL TO UNDERSTAND THE GREAT MATTER<span class=s4></span>” Science is
only trying to understand matter – what about the great matter?</p><p>What about the scientist himself? Albert Einstein may have discovered
great things about matter, but what about himself? He knows nothing at
all. He has never even thought that there is another</p><p>universe waiting to be explored – and it is the real universe. The
outer will be lost with your death, but the inner will continue. The
inner is your ultimate pilgrimage. Hence it is right to call it the
great matter – the great and ultimate concern.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the most painful thing, according to Tozan: that your
paradise is so close and yet you go on missing it. Your buddhahood is
just a question of opening your eyes. If you can become just a little
more alert than you are, a little more conscious, you will enter into
the timeless reality of existence. Its splendor is great – it has no
beginning and no end.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the most painful part for anyone who has realized his own
self – he can see millions of people in suffering. What is there in the
world except suffering, except misery, except pain? Every pleasure turns
into pain and all your joy is so superficial – it is not even skin deep.
It can be disturbed by a single word uttered against you – that is the
depth of your joy.</p><p><br></p><p>What are your riches? They will all be taken away. What are your
possessions? You have come into the world naked, and naked you will have
to go out of it. If you don’t search for who it is who comes and goes,
but just become involved in the non-essentials of life – this is the
greatest pain possible. To live and yet to miss the source of life; to
live only superficially, never going into the depths of your being or
the heights of your consciousness; to just remain mundane – this is the
most painful thing according to the Eastern approach. And I absolutely
agree with it.</p><p><br></p><p>ADDRESSING HIS MONKS, DOYO SAID, “YOU ARE ALREADY WITHIN THIS
TRADITION. A HUNDRED PERCENT IS NOT FAR FROM NINETY PERCENT.”</p><p><br></p><p>You are already ninety percent a buddha; and a hundred percent is not
far away. But remember one thing – that even ninety-nine percent will
not be close enough. Even ninety-nine-point-nine percent will still be
distant. You have to be a hundred percent here and now at the very
center of your being, and suddenly there arises within you a new, fresh,
eternal consciousness that knows nothing of pain, nothing of death; it
knows no beginning and no end. Your potential has blossomed into a
lotus.</p><p><br></p><p>You must have seen Gautam Buddha’s statues: he is sitting on a lotus.
That lotus is symbolic of the blossoming of consciousness to its
ultimate possibility and potentiality.</p><p><br></p><p>“A HUNDRED PERCENT IS NOT FAR FROM NINETY PERCENT. YOU SHOULD EXERT A
LITTLE MORE ENERGY. THEN YOU ELDERS WILL NOT TIRE OF YOUR PERPETUAL
JOURNEY AND YET WILL NOT TURN AWAY FROM THE MONASTERY.”</p><p><br></p><p>There is a Tibetan saying, that a hundred persons start to seek the
truth, and perhaps only one reaches it. Ninety-nine get lost somewhere
on the way. They either become involved in some other business or they
go astray. There are thousands of ways of going astray and there is only
one way of going into yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>Just a single inch’s difference and you are lost; you will not find
yourself. Every thought is trying to take you astray. Every feeling,
every sentiment – all the qualities of your mind are enemies as far as
the discovery of your center is concerned, because they are all pushing
you forward, outward: “Become a success, become prestigious, be more
powerful.” And your inner being remains starving. You go on pouring your
energy into the outside world, which is not really your home, and your
real</p><p>being is starving inside, waiting, for hundreds of lives. It is
hoping that one day you will turn back, wondering how long you can go on
missing.</p><p><br></p><p>I am reminded of a great king who was a lover of archery. He himself
was an adept, a master of archery. He was passing through a village and
he saw, on every tree, an arrow stuck exactly in the middle of a circle.
He could not believe his eyes, that in this village lives such a great
archer.</p><p><br></p><p>He stopped his chariot and asked the people, “Who is this master
archer?” They laughed and said, “Don’t bother about him; he is the
village idiot.”</p><p><br></p><p>The king said, “Whoever he is, he is a great archer.”</p><p><br></p><p>The villagers said, “You don’t understand his strategy. First he
shoots the arrow and then he makes a circle round it.” Obviously, he is
a hundred percent successful; he never fails.</p><p><br></p><p>In the inside world, you cannot deceive anyone in such a way. You
know your center and then you simply become radiant and fragrant, a
dance unto yourself. If you don’t know it, you may pretend that you are
happy, but it is all hypocrisy.</p><p><br></p><p>Have you ever thought about all the stories that end up with the
marriage of the hero and the heroine, with the sentence, “Afterwards
they lived happily”? Afterwards! In every story ... you cannot find a
single story in which this “afterwards they lived happily” does not
appear; but it is because afterwards is the hell, it is better not to
talk about it. All the pleasure is before the marriage; by the time the
honeymoon ends, everything is finished. You will be fortunate if your
love can survive the honeymoon – two weeks is too much! Two weeks
together, just exploring the same geography .…</p><p><br></p><p>(SARDAR GURUDAYAL SINGH GIVES A HEARTY LAUGH, THEN EVERYONE ELSE
LAUGHS.)</p><p><br></p><p>Look! You cannot defeat Sardar. He is really a nice fellow. He has
lived many honeymoons; he is not laughing out of ignorance – he knows
it!</p><p><br></p><p>One becomes fed up. Just to ask human beings to be together more than
two weeks is absolutely inhuman, because then comes misery and
suffering; and this misery and suffering is perpetuated by all the
churches and the religions. Because if there is no misery and no
suffering, who is going to go to the churches? The fellows you find in
churches are those who are suffering and asking God, “Why you are so
hard on me? Could not you give this woman to somebody else?”</p><p><br></p><p>An old Jew was dying on the road after an accident. A Catholic
priest, passing by, went near to the old man out of great Catholic
mercy, and said, “Remember God, his only begotten son Jesus Christ, and
the Holy Ghost.”</p><p><br></p><p>The Jew opened his eyes and said, “At least at the time of my death,
don’t give me any riddle. Death is enough – now don’t torture me with
riddles. God, the only begotten son, and the Holy Ghost ...?”</p><p><br></p><p>But the priest said, “You were praying – I saw your lips moving.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Yes, I am praying. I am saying, ‘God, for four thousand
years we have been your chosen people and we have suffered enough. Now
you should choose somebody else.’”</p><p>Everybody is suffering more from his friends than from his enemies,
because nobody marries enemies. Marriage is a contract between potential
enemies. Within two weeks everything will be clear. But then the
religions force people to remain together: “Suffer, be miserable, and
pray to God.” But by the way, God exists not, so all your prayers are
just going into the empty sky – there is no one to respond.</p><p><br></p><p>But everybody in the world is living in all kinds of miseries; and
they have chosen those miseries.</p><p><br></p><p>There is an ancient parable in India about a very rich man, very
successful; he was so rich that even the king had to borrow money from
him. He had everything that was possible, but he was always very sad and
miserable, always a long face. A young man used to come every day to
give him massage, who was always happy. He had nothing to be happy about
– and that was the problem for the rich man. The poor fellow got one
rupee per day. In those days, a rupee was really a rupee. The word
‘rupee’ means ‘gold’. One rupee was enough for one day, to live happily.
That poor man was not poor – he was living so joyously, and playing on
his flute in the middle of the night.</p><p><br></p><p>The rich man was worried because this fellow had nothing except one
rupee every day. “Why is he always so happy, so smiling, so laughing,
playing on his flute, singing, dancing?” The poor man lived close by, in
a small room that the rich man had provided for him.</p><p><br></p><p>The rich man asked his friend, who was as rich as he was, “What could
be the reason for this poor fellow’s being so happy?”</p><p><br></p><p>His friend said, “I will give you the answer.” And that night,
suddenly, the poor fellow woke up. Somebody had thrown a bag from the
roof containing ninety-nine rupees. That was the last day of his
happiness. Now he started to think, “How can I save some money and make
it at least a hundred?” He had never bothered – one rupee per day was
enough to live as richly as he wanted. But now he had more than he could
use for the day; he had to save. When it became one hundred, the desire
jumped up, flared up. If he went on collecting, soon he would have two
hundred, three hundred, four hundred. And as more and more money started
accumulating, he became more and more miserable, continuously thinking
of money. The song disappeared, the dance disappeared; the flute was
heard no more.</p><p><br></p><p>One day when the rich man was being massaged, he asked him, “What has
happened to you? You don’t look happy any more. Has some calamity
happened?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Yes, a calamity has happened. Somebody threw ninety-nine
rupees into my house, and since that day I have not slept well, because
the desire to have more and more has been aroused.”</p><p><br></p><p>Once you have the desire for more of anything, life is misery. It may
be knowledge, it may be money, it may be power; you may start desiring
anything, but you will become more and more sad. It is such a difficult
world .…</p><p><br></p><p>The prime minister of the country was visiting a psychiatric
hospital, and the superintendent of the hospital was explaining to him
about every inmate. One man was just crying and crying and beating his
head against the wall.</p><p><br></p><p>The prime minister asked, “What is the matter? What happened to this
poor fellow?”</p><p>He said, “He used to love a woman but could not get married to her.
His suffering is intense.”</p><p><br></p><p>And in the next room, another man was doing the same act – beating
his head, tearing his hair. The prime minister said, “What happened to
him?”</p><p><br></p><p>The superintendent laughed. He said, “He married that same
woman.”</p><p><br></p><p>Misery is bound to be there whether you marry the woman or you don’t
marry the woman, or the man; whether you go into this profession or into
that profession. Everywhere you will find yourself miserable, because
always you want more, and life is fleeting. Moment to moment, death is
coming closer, and you have not achieved your goal.</p><p><br></p><p>Outside there is nothing but misery. We can try to put on masks, we
can try to smile, but in fact we want to weep.</p><p><br></p><p>Friedrich Nietzsche has written exactly that sentence: “Don’t be
fooled by my smiles; I smile only when I want to hide my tears. I don’t
want to expose my wounds to anyone – it is so humiliating.”</p><p><br></p><p>And it becomes even more painful to see how close is the door of your
paradise – you are carrying it. A Sufi story makes it clear:</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla Nasruddin was carrying the door of his house. Somebody asked,
“What are you doing?” He said, “I am going into another town for some
work.”</p><p>They said, “You can go, but why are you carrying this door?”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “You are absolutely unintelligent. If there is no door to my
house, how can any thief enter? I always take my door with me.”</p><p><br></p><p>It is a Sufi way of saying that the door of your paradise is not
somewhere beyond the clouds; it is right within you. And except you,
nobody else can enter into it.</p><p><br></p><p>HE CONTINUED: “AN ANCIENT HAS SAID, ‘IF YOU WISH TO BE ABLE TO BEAR
THIS MATTER, YOU MUST GO AND STAND ATOP THE HIGHEST MOUNTAIN, AND WALK
ON THE BOTTOM OF THE DEEPEST SEA. ONLY THEN HAVE YOU SOME POWER.’”</p><p><br></p><p>It looks contradictory: how can you manage to be on the highest top
of a mountain, and at the same time at the deepest depth of the ocean?
But inside it is not a contradiction, because on the inside the highest
point of your consciousness is also the deepest point. It is as high as
any Everest, and it is as deep as any Pacific; it is both together. And
unless you have found this, you don’t have any power – you are just a
miserable creature. You don’t have even yourself, what to say about
power?</p><p><br></p><p>DOYO SAID, “IF YOU HAVE NOT YET TAKEN CARE OF THE GREAT MATTER, FOR
NOW YOU MUST TREAD THE HIDDEN ROAD.”</p><p><br></p><p>The road, of course, is hidden, because it is not outside, like a
highway; it is an absolutely private footpath inwards where nobody has
ever traveled. You make it yourself at the same time as you</p><p>move inside; it is not ready-made – because nobody else can enter
within you, only you can go there. But it is a question only of a single
step – the journey is not long. The moment you close your eyes and start
looking inwards, suddenly you are amazed that this is what you have been
seeking for many lives, and it is hidden just inside you. The road is
hidden, but it is not long – just a single step.</p><p><br></p><p>A MONK THEN ASKED, “WHAT IS ESTEEMED BY AN ASCETIC?” DOYO SAID,
“WHERE MIND’S CONSCIOUSNESS DOES NOT REACH.”</p><p>You must have heard the definition of an ascetic. In Zen they are not
accepted, but in other religions the ascetic is one who tortures himself
as a sacrifice to get God’s blessings; he becomes a sacrificial lamb. He
hungers, he starves himself, he beats his body; he remains naked in
winter, in summer. By an ascetic is meant somebody who sacrifices his
body and bodily pleasures in search of God.</p><p><br></p><p>Zen has a totally different approach, because this kind of ascetic is
simply a psychological case; it is nothing to do with religion. How,
even if God is there, will he be made happy by your starvation? By
torturing yourself you are simply proving that you are a masochist, that
you enjoy torturing yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>It is said that the perfect marriage is between a masochist and a
sadist. A sadist is one who loves to torture and the masochist is one
who loves to be tortured; it is the perfect marriage. But it is very
difficult to find any perfection in this world; just once in a while it
happens.</p><p><br></p><p>All the religions have been teaching psychological sickness to
people. Zen has nothing to do with any psychological sickness, because
it is not an exploitation of your sickness – it is a sharing of joy and
it brings you to your wholeness and health.</p><p><br></p><p>It even defines the word ‘ascetic’ as “WHERE MIND’S CONSCIOUSNESS
DOES NOT REACH” – that which is beyond mind, where no thought can reach,
but only pure silence, serenity. In that silence, in that meditative
state, you achieve your own innermost treasure.</p><p><br></p><p>ANOTHER MONK ASKED, “WHAT ARE THE GRADES OF BUDDHAS AND
PATRIARCHS?”</p><p><br></p><p>Our mind always thinks in grades, in hierarchies, in bureaucracies:
who is higher, who is lower. But the moment you transcend the mind you
also transcend this tendency to categorize. Then whether you call the
man who has gone beyond ‘the buddha’ or ‘the enlightened one’ or ‘the
awakened one’</p><p>.… You can call him ‘the master’ or ‘the patriarch’ but there is no
difference in their consciousnesses. They have all done a single thing –
they have left their mind and body behind and they have just centered
their wholeness within, unmoving. This is the greatest blessing that is
possible for a man. In this moment you become a buddha, a god,
yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember the difference: other religions are trying to pray to God;
Zen is trying to discover God in you.</p><p><br></p><p>There is no other God than your pure consciousness, and your pure
consciousness is not yours; it is simply consciousness. It covers every
other consciousness, it joins hands with the universal consciousness.
You disappear like a dewdrop – the ocean remains. But this disappearance
in the ocean is such a benediction, it is the only benediction there
is.</p><p>A THIRD MONK ASKED, “WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THE COMING OF BODHIDHARMA
FROM THE WEST?”</p><p><br></p><p>These are traditional Zen questions.</p><p><br></p><p>DOYO SAID, “MEETING NO ONE ON THE ANCIENT ROAD.”</p><p><br></p><p>These small questions had been answered thousands of times by
different masters in different ways, but they always brought a new light
to it. Now Doyo is bringing a tremendous new insight: that Bodhidharma
came to China from India, but wanted to meet no one; he wanted to meet
someone whose ego had died, who was no more a personality but just a
presence, a fragrance. This is MEETING NO ONE ON THE ANCIENT ROAD. All
the buddhas have been moving in search of those who are ready to
disappear into the ocean.</p><p><br></p><p>This is what we are doing here: trying in every possible way to put
aside the mind that is given by the society, and to bring our innocence
– the gift of nature – and disappear into the silence of the sky and the
trees.</p><p><br></p><p>If your thoughts stop, you stop; then what remains is the divine
dance of consciousness. Hakuin has written a small poem:</p><p>YOU NO SOONER ATTAIN THE GREAT VOID THAN BODY AND MIND ARE LOST
TOGETHER. HEAVEN AND HELL – A STRAW.</p><p>THE BUDDHA-REALM, PANDEMONIUM – SHAMBLES. LISTEN: A NIGHTINGALE
STRAINS HER VOICE, SERENADING THE SNOW.</p><p>LOOK: A TORTOISE WEARING A SWORD CLIMBS THE LAMPSTAND.</p><p>SHOULD YOU DESIRE THE GREAT TRANQUILITY, PREPARE TO SWEAT WHITE
BEADS.</p><p>These small poems stress a single point: that you have to be so
receptive – with no obstruction to your eyes, to your ears, to your
sensitivity – that the whole of life becomes a music, a poetry. Then
everything starts looking different: the green is greener, the rose is
rosier. It is the same song, but with a new meaning, a new significance;
the same mirror, but there is no longer any dust gathered on it.</p><p>Maneesha has asked:</p><p><br></p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>I DO NOT FEEL THE PAIN OF BEING A DISCIPLE AND NOT UNDERSTANDING
ENLIGHTENMENT, AS I DO THE HELL OF THOSE TIMES OF BEING CLOSED TO
YOU.</p><p><br></p><p>IN FACT, I SEEM TO ONLY BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND ANYTHING AT ALL IN THE
CONTEXT OF YOU, THE MASTER. YOU ARE MY FRAMEWORK, MY TOUCHSTONE. IS THAT
OKAY?</p><p><br></p><p>Maneesha, absolutely okay – not only for you, but for every buddha
who is present here. These seven thousand buddhas are here just to be
awakened, and to look into my awakening as a touchstone.</p><p><br></p><p>Before we enter into our inner doors, a little laughter will be
helpful, just to dust and cleanse your mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Two madmen, Goonski and Nutzo, are standing in a field within the
grounds of the asylum. They are gazing in silence at a beautiful sunset
when Goonski says with delight, “Oh wow!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh yes,” replies Nutzo. “Really wow, oh, wow!”</p><p><br></p><p>After a while, Nutzo turns to Goonski and says, “You know, for a show
like this, these guys must have spent plenty of money; but they won’t
even give us three dollars to go and see the gorillas in the zoo!”</p><p><br></p><p>Henry and Morris are partners in a tailors shop in New York. One
summer, Henry goes on his first hunting trip. When he gets back to the
shop afterwards, Morris cannot wait to hear all about it.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well,” begins Henry, “I go into the woods with the guide, but you
know me, within five minutes I get lost. So I’m walking around in the
woods, not knowing where I am, when all of a sudden I come face to face
with the biggest goddamn bear you have ever seen. I turn around and run
as fast as I can, but the bear is running faster.</p><p><br></p><p>“Just when I feel his hot breath on my neck, he slips and falls. I
keep running, but the bear is catching up again. He is almost on top of
me when he slips and falls again. Then I run into a clearing, with the
bear close behind, and I see the other hunters and shout for help. Just
then the bear slips and falls again, and the guide is able to shoot and
kill him.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Wow!” says Morris. “That is quite a story. You are a very brave man.
If that had been me, I would have shit in my pants!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Use your brain, Morris,” snaps Henry. “What do you think the bear
was slipping on?”</p><p><br></p><p>The distraught young man is perched on the ledge, forty floors up,
and he is threatening to jump. The police are pleading with him to
return to safety, but he seems determined to commit suicide. A priest is
called from the nearby church, and he hurries to the scene.</p><p>“Think, my son,” he intones to the young man. “Think of your mother
and father who love you.” “They don’t love me,” shouts the man, “I’m
jumping!”</p><p>“No, stop!” cries the priest. “Think of the woman who loves you!”
“Nobody loves me! I’m jumping!” he shouts back.</p><p>“But think,” the priest begs, “think of Jesus, Mary, and Joseph who
love you!” “Jesus, Mary, and Joseph?” cries the man. “Who the hell are
they?”</p><p>At which point the priest throws down his bible and screams back,
“Jump, you Jew, jump!” Now, Nivedano ... give a good beat and everybody
goes crazy.</p><p>(Drumbeat) (Gibberish) Nivedano ... (Drumbeat)</p><p>Be silent. Close your eyes. Feel as if your body is frozen. Gather
your energy inwards.</p><p>Travel this ancient path to your own center.</p><p>Deeper, deeper, deeper; and as you go deep, you start feeling</p><p>a totally different dimension opening within you.</p><p>This is the great matter;</p><p><br></p><p>the door to the kingdom of God.</p><p>God is within you.</p><p><br></p><p>Other than this,</p><p><br></p><p>there is no God anywhere.</p><p><br></p><p>To make it absolutely clear, Nivedano ... (Drumbeat)</p><p>Relax. Let go. Completely die,</p><p>as far as your body and mind is concerned. Just feel the beyond; it
is your home.</p><p>This beyond opens</p><p><br></p><p>the lotus of your being. This beyond makes you a buddha.</p><p>In a lightning moment,</p><p><br></p><p>suddenly you are no more ordinary – you have become a sacred
mountain.</p><p>Simultaneously</p><p><br></p><p>at the top of a great mountain</p><p><br></p><p>and in the depths of a great ocean ... where these two meet,</p><p>this is your very center.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the center of the cyclone. Nivedano ...</p><p>(Drumbeat)</p><p>Call all the buddhas back.</p><p><br></p><p>Sit down for a few moments</p><p><br></p><p>to realize and recognize where you have been. Recollect the joy,</p><p>the blissfulness, the ecstasy,</p><p><br></p><p>so that it becomes part of your being, twenty-four hours.</p><p>Whatever you are doing –</p><p><br></p><p>carrying water from the well or chopping wood – you are a buddha.</p><p>To be a buddha is the destiny of every human being.</p><p>To miss it is really painful. To get it is to be blessed. Okay,
Maneesha?</p><p>Yes, Osho.</p><p><br></p><p>Can we celebrate all the buddhas present here? Yes, Osho.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part5>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

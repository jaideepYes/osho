Abu, Rajasthan, India\nNOW LET MY SPIRIT MEET THE ABSOLUTE PERVADING ALL THROUGHOUT THE VITAL AIR, AND LET MY BODY BE REDUCED TO ASHES.\nO MY MIND FULL OF EGO AND DESIRES, NOW REMEMBER YOUR PAST ACTIONS, REMEMBER YOUR PAST DEEDS.\nLet life merge into that from which it was born. Let the shape lose itself in that formlessness from which it was created. Let them be one in that pure consciousness of being. Let the body be mixed with dust, let it be merged into earth. In such a moment – and there are two such moments – the sage addresses his egoistic mind full of desires: “O my mind full of ego and desires, remind yourself of your past actions.”\nThere are two moments when this prayer may be truly offered. One is the moment of death and the other is that of samadhi, deep meditation. The one is when a person is on the threshold of death, and the other is when he is at the greater death – samadhi – ready to merge himself like a drop into the ocean. Most of the people who have explained this sutra have interpreted it with reference to the first moment – that of physical death. They have assumed that the sage is saying this at the moment of death, when his whole existence is going to be merged into that from where he came. But as I\nsee it, this remembrance is not made at all at the moment of death, but at the moment of samadhi. It is not appropriate to the moment of death, because there is no precognition of death. You never know at what moment death will come. You know about it when it comes, but by that time you are already dead. As long as death has not come one does not know about it; and when it comes, the person who should know has already passed away.\nWhen Socrates was about to die, his friends asked him the reason why he did not appear afraid, miserable or worried. Then Socrates said, “I think this way: as long as death has not come, I am alive; when I am alive, why should I worry about death? And who will be left to worry about death when it actually comes and I am no more? I shall be completely lost in death, nothing will be left behind, and if nothing of me remains beyond death, then there is no reason to be afraid of anything. On the other hand, if, as some people say, I shall not die even after death, then there is no reason at all to worry about death.”\nAs I said, this sutra is meaningful in two moments, either at the moment of death or at the moment of samadhi. But we have no idea at all of the moment of death – it is unpredictable, it cannot be foretold. It comes all of a sudden, at any moment. It may happen any moment, there is no foreknowledge of that moment, and this prayer can be made only when there is foreknowledge; that is, when the sage knows, “I am about to die, I am at the door of death.”\nNo, this is not a prayer made at the moment of death. It is made at the time of the great death – samadhi means great death. I consider mortal death an ordinary death because then only the body dies; the mind does not die. I consider meditation, samadhi, the great death because there is no idea, no remembering of the body at all in that condition; the mind dies too. Hence I say that this prayer is made at the time of samadhi, because the sage is asking his egoistic and desiring mind to remember its past actions.\nThe second part of this sutra has been much misunderstood. The fact is that such things as these are usually interpreted for us by pundits – by our self-professed wise men. However intelligent their interpretations and explanations may be, they commit a fundamental error. They understand the words and principles of the scriptures correctly, but they do not understand at all that which is hidden unsaid behind the words and principles. The hidden essence is never contained in the actual words of religions. It is to be understood from the gaps between the words. The meaning is not in the lines but in the spaces between the lines. So those who are unable to understand the spaces, those who read only the printed words, cannot correctly interpret these great sutras.\nThere is a movement called Krishna Consciousness in the West. I was just looking at a book on the Ishavasya Upanishad by Swami Bhakti Vedant Prabhupad – the leader of this movement. I was very much surprised to read his interpretation of this sutra. The way he explains it is: “I am on the point of dying, I am standing at the door of death. Therefore, O God, please accept the sacrifices and renunciation I have made for you: remember the actions I have performed for you.”\nNot only is he unable to read the spaces between the words, he seems unable to read even the words themselves, finding other words instead. The sage is addressing his egoistic and desiring mind – there is no question here at all of bringing God in. Nor does the sage say, “Remember the actions which I performed for you, remember the sacrifices I made for you.” But our business mind loves to interpret it in this way. It will say at the moment of death, “O God, remember, I have given a\nlot of money to charities, I have built a temple for you, I have built a dam for the village, and so on. O God, my time is over, now give me a fitting reward for all the actions and sacrifices I have made for your sake.”\n“My egoistic and desiring mind.” Will is the channel of our desires, of the longings of the mind. It is\nnecessary to understand what will is so that the discussion may be easily followed. Desires arise in the minds of all of us, but desire does not become will till the ego is linked with it.\nEgoistic desire becomes will. All people have desires, but these desires remain mere dreams as long as they are not linked with ego, as long as they do not become actions. To be translated into actions, a desire has to be linked with ego. Then it becomes will. Vanity – ego – is born to perform, to be. A desire to be the doer arises. You become the doer as soon as ego is united with desire.\nThe sage says, “O my mind full of ego and desires, remember the actions done by you.” Why does he say this, and not just once but twice? Why? What need is there to remember this at the moment of samadhi or at the moment of death? The sage is just making a joke. He is just laughing at himself. At the gate of samadhi everything is passing away: the mind is evaporating, the body is passing away, the spirit is disappearing – everything is being absorbed. “O my mind, what happened to all that you were thinking about? I did this – I did that. Where are all those ideas that you were absorbed in, all those lines you were drawing on water? Gone!”\nRemember, all that you have done is passing away – even you are passing away. Have a look back into the past, and remember with what pride and vanity you thought, “I have done this!” With what dreams you planned to do that! Remember all the footprints of your countless births and travels. No trace of them is seen today, and today you are also going to be nothing; no trace of you will remain. Today all the elements will be absorbed in themselves. Today your entire journey will be over.\nSo have a retrospective look, just once, and understand how great an illusion you have been living in, what dreams you have been dreaming in your madness, what hardships you have undergone for them, and how, lost in anxiety, you have lived for the sake of these dreams. And when any of your dreams were not fulfilled, think of the anguish and frustration you passed through. And remember how overjoyed you became when a dream of yours was fulfilled. Today all dreams and all achievements have disappeared, and you too are about to pass away. Looking backwards, remember all these things once more.\nIn great jest and joking the sage thus addresses his own egoistic will, his vain mind. That is why, I tell you, this is not said at the time of death but at the time of samadhi, because only the body perishes at the time of death; the egoistic mind does not. You travel with your mind even after death. That mind is the current of your countless births. The body falls here, the mind travels on with you. Desires accompany you. Ego travels with you. The memory of past actions goes with you. The desire to accomplish those things you could not do goes with you. Your entire mind goes with you. Only the physical body dies. Mind leaves the body and catches hold of a new body – this mind that has already caught hold of countless bodies in the past and will go on doing so.\nThis is why those who know do not consider death to be real death – because nothing perishes in it, we merely change our clothes. Understand this well: the body is no more than clothes, no more than an outer covering. Ordinarily we think that the body is born first and then the mind is born in it. This\nis wrong. During the last two hundred years Western thinking and belief has spread the illusion that the body is created first, and that the mind is then born in it, as a by-product, an epiphenomenon, as simply one quality, one attribute of the body. It is similar to what the ancient Charvakas used to say – that if you separate the ingredients that are blended to make wine, and eat or drink them separately, there will be no intoxication. The intoxicant is a by-product of the contents being mixed together. It does not come from somewhere of its own accord, it has no separate existence. It is produced by mixing a number of things together. If the ingredients are separated it disappears. So the ancient Charvakas used to argue that the body is composed of five elements and mind is produced by the union of these five elements. Mind is a by-product.\nWestern science is at present also in a state of ignorance in this matter, believing that the mind comes after the body, as a shadow. But in the East, those who have searched deeply into this subject maintain that the mind is first and the body comes like a shadow after it. Let us understand it in this way: what comes first in your life, the action or the desire? First comes the desire in the mind, and then it is turned into action – the action follows. But if anyone sees it from outside, he will see the action first and will have to guess about the desire behind the action. Suppose anger arose within me and I slapped you: first came anger, first came the mind, then the hand was raised and the body performed the action. But you will see my hand and the act of slapping first. Even so, you will no doubt reason that I must first have become angry. The bodily action is seen first, and as a result you start guessing what is going on in my mind. But still those workings of my mind came first, and the action of the body follows.\nWhen a child is born we also see the body first, but those who know deeply say it is the mind that comes first. That very mind causes the body to be conceived and born. That mind creates the outline, the form of this body. It is a sort of blueprint, it is an in-built program. When a person dies, his mind goes on its journey with a blueprint, and that blueprint maps itself into a new womb. And you will be surprised to know this: we commonly believe that a body is produced when a man and a woman make love, and then a soul enters the body, but on looking deeply into this phenomenon it becomes evident that when a soul desires to enter a womb, then both the man and the woman become eager for sexual activity. Again, it is the body that is seen first, and we have to guess about the mind. However, those who have looked deeply into this matter say that when a soul desirous of entering a womb begins to wander around you, then there arises a longing for sexual enjoyment. The mind is busy getting a body ready for itself. You might not have thought of this happening.\nWhen you lie down to sleep at night – when sleep begins to descend upon you and has almost caught you – bring your consciousness to the last thought in your mind, then go to sleep; and when you wake up in the morning and are ready to leave your bed, look back and find your first thought on waking. You will be very surprised by the result. The last thought of the night becomes the first one in the morning. In the same way, the last desire at the time of death becomes the first desire at the time of birth.\nIn death, the body disintegrates but the mind continues its journey. The age of your body may be fifty years but that of your mind can be five million. The sum total of all the minds born in all your births is there in you even today. Buddha has given a very significant name to this happening. He was the first to do so. He named it the storehouse of consciousness. Like a storehouse, your mind has stored all the memories of all your past births – so your mind is very old. And it is not that your mind is the storehouse of only human births: if you were born as animals or as trees, as is surely the case, the memories of all those births are also present within you.\nPeople who have conducted profound inquiries into the process of the storehouse of consciousness say that if all of a sudden the feeling of love swells in the mind of any man on seeing a rose, the reason is that there is a memory deep within him of himself being a rose in the past, which is rekindled on feeling its resonance in a rose. It is not accidental if a person loves dogs very much. There are memories in his storehouse of consciousness which make him aware of his great kinship with dogs. Whatever happens in our lives is not accidental. A subtle process of cause and effect is working behind these happenings. Though the body perishes in death, the mind continues its journey and goes on collecting memories. This is why sometimes you see forms in your mind of which you would say, “They are not mine.” Sometimes you do certain things that cause you to feel strange and say, “This has been done in spite of me.” Suppose a person quarrels with somebody and bites him. Afterwards he thinks, “How strange that I could bite him! Am I a wild animal?” He is not today, but once he was; and a moment may come when his hidden memory becomes so active that he behaves exactly like an animal. All of us behave like animals on many occasions. That behavior does not descend from the sky, it comes from the store within our mind.\nOur death is the death of our body only. Our mind full of ego and desires does not die then, so there would have been no opportunity for the sage to joke in this way if he were simply facing physical death. This sutra is said at the time of samadhi. There is one distinguishing feature of samadhi: its arrival can be announced beforehand. Death surprises, samadhi is invited. Death happens, samadhi is planned. Progressing step by step in meditation, man reaches to the state of samadhi.\nUnderstand the great significance of the word samadhi. At times the word samadhi is also used to mean a grave. The grave of a sage is called a samadhi. It is rightly called so. Samadhi is a kind of death, but a profound and remarkable one. The body remains here after death, but the mind within is destroyed. At this moment of the mind’s destruction the sage says, “O my mind full of ego and desires, remember the actions done by you in the past.” He is saying this because the mind has deceived him in the past again and again; but today this very mind is being destroyed.\n“Depending and relying on my mind I lived my life. Through victory and defeat, happiness and unhappiness, success and failure, hopes and disappointments, I believed it would be always with me; but now I see it was deceiving me. Leaning on it for support I made such a long journey, but today I find that my support is perishing – disintegrating forever. I thought it to be a sturdy boat, but today I find that it is itself water merging into the river.”\nIn this moment the sage is addressing his mind: “O my egoistic mind, remember the actions done by you, and actions desired and intended by you. Remember the promises you made, consolations you offered. Remember how much I confided in you. Remember what you induced me to do. Remember the illusions you created in me. Remember the dreams you gave me. Remember the follies you led me into. Now you yourself are going away, and I am entering a region where you will not be. Till now you have always persuaded me that where ego is not, where will is not, there is no being. But I see today that you are going away, yet my being remains.”\nThe mind always says, “If there is no will you will perish. You will be unable to stand up against the conflicts of life. If there is no ego in you, you will perish; you will not survive!” The mind always instigates action, determination and fight. “If you don’t fight you will be wiped out.” Surely, it is only natural for the sage on this day to make fun of his mind, to say to the mind, “You yourself are perishing today while I am intact. You are departing, I am not. Until now you have deceived me, telling me that I shall not be saved if you are not. But today you are leaving and I am not.”\nThe sage makes use of this moment to joke and jest for two reasons: one is for his own mind, and the other is for the minds of those who have not yet reached the door of samadhi and are busily occupied in a thousand and one activities, whose minds are inducing them to do this and to do that, whose minds still tell them, “Your life is wasted if you fail to accomplish this, if you fail to build this palace,” whose minds tell them, “You are worth nothing if you fail to accomplish this mission, this adventure.”\nTo such people the sage is addressing his joke. He warns them to think again, because the mind is the greatest deceiver. All our deceptions are created by the mind. Each and every one of us lives in a dream world, and the mind is so clever that it does not allow us to see deep enough to reveal its deceptions. The mind is ready with a new deception before we are able to see through the previous one. Before the previous one is destroyed, mind fabricates another structure of deception and entices us, saying, “Come in here, take rest here.”\nIf a desire were fulfilled and the mind were to allow you a single moment’s interval, you would be able to see that nothing was really achieved through the fulfillment of your first desire, for which you endured so much trouble and anxiety. What did you really get? Less than rubbish! But the mind does not allow even that much interval, that much chance. The mind begins to plant the seeds of your next desire before the last one is fulfilled. When a desire is fulfilled, it is found to be useless and the interest is lost, but the mind immediately raises the germ of a new desire. The race begins again: the mind never gives you an opportunity to rest, to stop so that you can see what deception you are in. When the ground disappears from under your feet, the mind does not allow you to see the hole in its place, but offers you instead a new piece of ground on which to stand.\nI will tell you a short but interesting story which Buddha used to narrate. You may have heard it, but you may not have interpreted it in this way.\nA man was running through a forest. Now, a man runs for one of two reasons: either something in front attracts him, or else something from behind is pushing him. This man was running for both reasons. He was running in search of diamonds, because somebody had told him there was a diamond mine in the forest. But he was running very fast at this moment because a lion was after him. He had forgotten diamonds for the moment and was thinking of how to save himself from the lion. He ran without losing heart, but eventually reached a dead end. There was no road ahead, only a deep and dangerous pit, and no way to go back – no way to turn back, either through the forest or along the road. This is how you run, in pursuit of diamonds or to save your life, and there is no going back! All past time is gone forever. You cannot step back even an inch into the past.\nThis man, pursued by the lion, was also unable to return, and the road ahead was a dead end. Greatly afraid and seeing no way out, he did what a desperate person would do. Catching hold of the roots of a tree, he swung himself over the edge of the pit, thinking to climb out when the lion had gone away. But the lion, standing near the mouth of the pit, began to wait for him. The lion also has his desires! He thought, “The man will have to come up in the end.” When the man saw the lion waiting for him, he looked below for a way to save himself, and there, roaring in the pit below, was a mad elephant.\nWe can imagine how pitiable and miserable his condition was – but not yet pitiable enough. The trials and tribulations of life are without number. No amount of conflict and upset can exhaust life’s\npotential to create more. Suddenly he realized that the root he was clinging to was slowly, slowly giving way. He looked up and saw two rats busy gnawing away at the roots. One was white and the other black. Buddha used to liken them to the days and nights which go on shortening man’s life. We can understand how great a danger his life was in now, with no escape possible. But no, the desires of man are amazing, and his mind’s tricks of deception are wonderful. At that moment he saw a honeycomb above the root, from which drops of honey were falling, one by one. He put out his tongue, and a drop fell on it. He closed his eyes in great joy, and said to himself, “How blessed I am, how sweet it is.” At that moment there was neither the lion above nor the elephant below, neither the rats cutting the roots nor any fear of death. In that moment he forgot all his fears, and could only feel, “How sweet!”\nBuddha used to say that each person is in this predicament, but the mind goes on dripping drops of honey one after another. Man closes his eyes and says, “How sweet!” This is the situation all the time. There is death above and there is death below. Where life is, death is all around. Life is surrounded by death, and the roots of life themselves are being cut every moment. Every day, every moment, life is being emptied. Just as the sand in an hourglass slips away from one moment to the next, so our life is slipping away. But even so, if a drop of honey falls we close our eyes and begin to dream of hopes. The mind tells us, “See, how sweet it is!” When one drop is finished another is ready to fall. The mind continues to sustain us with deception, drop by drop.\nSo the sage says, “O my egoistic and desiring mind, think of the deceptions you have practiced upon me. Now remember this: all your past actions and all your future plans – you were the instigator of those actions, but today you meet your doom. You are at the gates of destruction, you are about to be rubbed out.” At the gates of samadhi the mind becomes a void; thoughts cease to come, doubts and uncertainties of the mind disappear, the waves of the mind become calm. There is absolutely no mind. When there is no mind, there is samadhi.\nI have told you that one meaning of samadhi is a grave – the grave of a saint. The second meaning of samadhi is the condition of doubtlessness, where doubts do not exist. It is worth knowing that where the mind is, there are doubts and doubts and doubts; there can never be doubtlessness. Mind is the great alchemist of doubt. As leaves sprout on a tree, doubts sprout in the mind; doubtlessness never sprouts there, it is there only when the mind is not. So when a person approaches me with a request to make his mind free of doubts, I tell him, “Don’t bother about that; you will never be able to make mind free from doubts. Leave aside your mind and you will have doubtlessness.”\nA friend was asking me this evening, “How can I be free from greed?”\nI told him, “You can never be free, because you yourself are greed. As long as you are, you can never be without greed. If you are not, greed will not be there.”\nDoubtlessness in the mind is never possible; it comes only when the mind is not. That is why no- mind is called samadhi – there is no doubt at all. As long as the mind is, it will go on creating doubts upon doubts. If you solve one doubt, it will give rise to another, and if someone gives you a solution, the mind will create ten doubts out of that solution.\nA friend had informed me by letter that he was going to attend the meditation camp. He saw me two days ago. He had written to me that his mind was full of restlessness. After three days in the camp\nhis restlessness has disappeared. “After three days,” he told me, “my restlessness has gone away, but is the restfulness I now feel not a deception?”\nI asked him, “Did your mind ever tell you that restlessness is a deception?” He said, “The mind never said so.”\nI asked, “How long have you been restless?” He replied, “I have always been restless.”\nHis mind never questioned whether this restlessness was not a deception. And now when he has become restful for the last three days, the mind asks, “Is this peace real? Is it not a deception?” The mind is amazing! Even if God meets you, your mind will raise a doubt: “I cannot say definitely whether he is the real or an artificial one.” As long as mind is, doubt will surely arise. So as long as you keep your mind you will remain in great difficulty. Even if bliss comes, the mind becomes suspicious and doubts its presence. The mind creates doubts, raises suspicions and uncertainties, and gives birth to worries and anxieties.\nIn spite of all this, why do we hold on to the mind so tight? If the mind is the root of all these illnesses – as those who know tell us – then what is the reason for clinging so tightly to it? For the answer, look to the sage’s challenging remarks. The reason we cling to it so tightly is that we are afraid that if the mind is not then we also shall not be. In fact, intentionally or unintentionally, we have identified ourselves with it. We have come to believe, “I am the mind.” As long as this is our understanding we will continue to cling to all those illnesses.\nYou are not the mind! You are that which knows the mind, which sees it and which is fully conversant with it. To realize this you will have to move a little away from it, you will have to stand off a little from it, you will have to raise yourself a little above it. You will have to stand on the shore to see the flow of the mind and to recognize it. How can you leave it as long as you identify yourself with it? That would be suicidal. To leave the mind means to die. So you will not be able to leave it. He alone can give it up who knows, “I am not the mind.”\nThe first step into samadhi is this experience: “I am not the mind.” This experience becomes more and more profound till it becomes so clear and secure that the mind disappears completely. It disappears like the flame of a lamp whose oil is finished. Even if the oil in the lamp is finished, the wick will continue to burn as long as there is a little oil in the wick – but now it will not burn for long. The sage is in a similar condition. He has realized, “I am not the mind,” but the flame continues burning now from the little oil remaining in the wick. The sage is addressing this flame in its last burning moments, “O my egoistic mind, you promised me to be always with me and to give me light. But you are on the point of being extinguished. I see now that the oil is finished, so I ask you how long can you last now? You are completely finished, and yet I AM.” So he is telling his dying mind, “I was always separate from you, but I always identified with you. It was my delusion – samsara, maya – the great delusion!”\nThe sage is addressing himself, and as I told you, he is addressing you also. Perhaps you can also realize it. Go back to your childhood and remember how anxious you were to be top of the\nclass: how you lost sleep at night, how much the load of examinations weighed on your mind, how you believed everything depended on them! But today there is no examination, there is no class. Go back and check up: what difference did it make whether you came first, or second or third – or failed? Today you remember nothing of these happenings. Go back and see. You picked a quarrel with someone: you thought it was a matter of life and death. Today, after ten years, that quarrel looks like lines drawn on water. Someone insulted you in the street and you struggled with the problem of how to protect yourself from his abuse. Just look: you were not destroyed. The abuse is not there now. Today you remember nothing of it. Go back and see how much importance you attached to it then. Is it that important today? No, it has no importance at all now.\nRemember, the thing which you value today will be worthless tomorrow, so do not give it much importance today. Learn from your experience of yesterday, and withdraw all this value you place on the things you do now. The sage is telling his egoistic mind, on the strength of all his experiences in life, “I considered you so very important, but I tell you very definitely, at this moment of bidding you farewell, that you practiced deception throughout. It was my foolishness not to see that I was and am separate from you.”\nWhen the mind vanishes everything vanishes, because it is the nucleus to which everything is linked. The wheel of our entire life revolves on it. Therefore the sage declares that the five elements in the body will absorb themselves in their sources and everything will vanish, because the mind – the nucleus joining all together – is disappearing today.\nWhen he attained to the ultimate knowledge Buddha said a wonderful thing. When his mind was destroyed for the first time and he entered that state of void, he said exactly the thing which the sage of the Upanishad has said. He said, “O mind, now I bid you farewell. Till now you were needed, for I wanted to have a human form. But now I do not need the human body so you can leave. Till now, needing the body, I needed its architect, the mind, too. Nobody can be created without it. Now I have my supreme abode. Now I have reached my destination. Now I have reached that uncreated house, that dwelling in my self. Now you can depart.”\nSuch sutras are very important for seekers of truth. There is no benefit in committing them to memory. They are beneficial only if kept in the heart. If they are memorized and repeated every day they become stale. By and by their meaning is lost, and only dead words remain. But if this fact – that the mind is nothing but a deception – is clearly understood by you, then a new revolution will enter your life. I am not speaking on these sutras with a view to your memorizing what I say and becoming a pundit. No, you are already a pundit even before hearing me: there is no need to increase the bulk of your knowledge. I speak on them to give you a true picture of the realities of life. If remembering happens, let it be through the awareness that these sutras bring in throwing light on the way in which you live.\nChuang Tzu was a Chinese master. One evening he was passing with his disciples through a cremation ground. A skull knocked against his foot. He picked it up, touching it often with his head, and begged its pardon. His disciples asked him, “Why are you doing this? We always thought you were a man of wisdom. What is this madness showing in you now?”\nChuang Tzu replied, “You don’t understand. This cremation ground is reserved for VIP’s. Only the most important people of the town are cremated here.”\nThey said, “Whoever they may be, high or low, death is the great leveler.”\nDeath is a great communist – it puts everybody on the same level. But Chuang Tzu said, “No, I have to beg its pardon. Suppose this man was alive now, what would be my position?”\nThe disciples said, “This man is not alive now, so why should you worry about him?”\nBut Chuang Tzu took the skull home and kept it near his bed. Whoever came to see him wondered why the skull was kept there. Chuang Tzu would say, “Unintentionally my foot knocked against it. As the man is no more, I have no opportunity to beg his pardon, so I am in a difficulty. To solve the problem I have brought the skull home, and I go on begging its pardon in the hope that one day I may be heard.”\nHearing this, people used to say to him, “What nonsense you are talking!”\nThen he would say, “The other reason I brought it here is for it to be my constant reminder that sooner or later my skull will also be lying in a burial ground and people will kick it here and there. I do not mind that, but I am sorry I shall not be in a position to forgive anyone who begs my pardon. So a great understanding about my skull has come to me since I brought this skull home. Looking at it I shall remain calm and unagitated even if someone kicks my skull!”\nThis is existential understanding, it is not intellectual. The understanding has borne fruit, the person is transformed. In the same way, if this sutra reaches your heart it will bear fruit when you are doing something and your mind is urging you this way or that.\nFor example, this sutra should be given to a man like Morarji Desai, whose mind is constantly planning to do this and to do that. The mind goes on working like this until death, though it gets nothing from its activity. Starting his career as a deputy collector, he has risen to the position of deputy minister, but he has achieved nothing. Even if he rises further, nothing fruitful, nothing worthwhile, is ever going to come of it. The mind always keeps you in difficulty, whether it wins or loses. The mind is like a gambler. If it loses, it thinks, “Let me play once again – I may win.” And if it wins, it thinks, “Now my luck is in, I must not miss it; let me play once again.” If he is winning, the gambler becomes more hopeful, and goes on playing. If he loses, his mind balks at the prospect of going away defeated: “Play once more, you may win. Try again!”\nSo remember this sutra when the mind, like a gambler, urges you on, win or lose! And address it thus: “O my mind full of ego and desires... remember your past actions.” The result of this remembering will be that your great attraction to a particular action will be lessened. Your stupidity in thinking of yourself as a doer will be smashed, and you will move closer towards samadhi. You will deepen the intensity of your meditation. Bear in mind, unconsciousness or unawareness will not do. If you go on remaining unaware and insensible to the workings of the mind, then your mind will repeat what it did yesterday.\nPerhaps you do not know this, but your mind never does anything new or fresh. It simply goes on repeating what it has done before. You were angry yesterday, you were angry the day before yesterday; and after your anger the day before yesterday you repented and vowed never to be angry again. Yesterday you did the same again, and here you are again doing the same thing today. Your\nanger is old, and your repentance is also old. Day after day you are repeating this sort of behavior. If you are unable to drop anger, at least leave aside the repenting for it; break one of your old habits at least! But you will not do this; your anger and your repentance go hand in hand.\nMan’s entire life is a repetition. It is no different from that of a bullock working in a sugarcane mill. The bullock may think it is walking a great distance because its eyes remain closed as it continues walking round and round. It may think it has traveled all the earth and must be nearing its destination. Like the bullock, the mind travels in a circle. If a person keeps a daily diary, he will have to consider whether he is anything more than a machine: the same activities, the same daily routine, repeated over and over. After twenty years living together, the wife knows what her husband will say when he comes home late in the evening; she has twenty years’ experience. The husband also knows how his wife will react to his excuses. Even so, both of them will go through the same questions and the same answers.\nAbsorbed thus in the mechanical process of the mind, the man who lives in unawareness misses all the opportunities he meets with in his life – and the opportunities are not few, but we are so clever in missing each of them. Every day there comes a fresh opportunity to be new by not repeating the old – but we repeat the old. This happens because we do not bear in mind this sutra... remember your past actions. Before you get angry tomorrow, tell your mind, “O mind, remember all the occasions you have become angry before.” First, stop for a couple of seconds and remember the occasions of being angry before, and then be angry. And I tell you, you will be unable to be angry then.\nWhenever the mind becomes full of desires and passions, address your mind thus: “O my mind full of ego and desires, remember the desires you have cherished in the past.” Keep your old experiences in mind before embarking on a new journey, then you will not start on yet another journey through the old. Your desire will stand amazed and puzzled! This much awareness is enough to break the mind’s mechanical way of working.\nGurdjieff has recorded in his memoirs that his father’s last advice changed the entire course of his life. He was a small boy then, the youngest in the house. His father, who was on his deathbed, called all his sons and said something to each of them. When the youngest was called the father said, “Come near me and bend your head towards me, I want to tell you something which you should bear in mind throughout your life. I have nothing else to give you. I want you to make me one promise – that whenever an opportunity arises to commit an evil deed you will wait for twenty-four hours. Of course, you may do it, but wait for twenty-four hours before you do it. Give me this promise. If you want to be angry, be fully angry; I do not forbid you, but do it after twenty-four hours. If you want to murder someone, do it with all your heart, but wait for twenty-four hours.”\nGurdjieff asked, “What is the purpose of this?”\nHis father said, “By following this advice you will be able to do the deed in a better way. You will be able to plan it well, and it is my life’s experience that there will be no mistake in your planning. My gift to you is this experience.”\nGurdjieff has written, “This one piece of advice changed the course of my life, because no one can do an evil deed if he waits even for twenty-four seconds, let alone twenty-four hours.”\nWhen you become angry, look at your watch and tell yourself, “I shall be angry after one minute.” When the second hand completes one circle, put down the watch and begin to be angry. You will not be able to be angry because the glimpse and reflection of all the past occasions of becoming angry will return to your mind during the sixty-second interval. All the past repentances, all the vows taken by you, all your decisions not to do that again, all these things will reappear in front of you, and you will be unable to become angry.\nBut we do not wait in committing an evil deed; we only wait in doing a good deed. A friend came today and expressed his desire to be initiated into sannyas on his birthday, two or three months from now. No one waits till his birthday if he wants to be angry! I asked him, “Is it certain? How do you know where you will be on your birthday? It may even be the day of your death!”\nEven the next moment you cannot trust, what to say of two or three months’ time! We postpone a good action, but the evil one we do immediately in case we miss the opportunity of doing it. No, postpone the evil, and do the good immediately. You cannot trust the next moment; it may come, it may not come. If you miss the moment of doing good, the opportunity may not come again, and if you wait – even for a moment – to do an evil deed, I tell you, you will not be able to do it. One who is strong enough to wait for a moment will be unable to do an evil deed. To wait for a moment requires great strength. It is the greatest strength in this world to wait for a second when the eyes begin to turn red with blood and the fists begin to be clenched in anger.\nThe sage has created this sutra in order to make fun of himself – to laugh at himself as well as at all of us. Enough for today.\nTry to understand a few points about meditation before we begin. The first thing is never to postpone it, not even for a second. Don’t think, “I shall begin tomorrow.” It is to be practiced now.\nI have to say something about those who are sitting behind me. I had asked them to sit; it seems they thought they had simply to sit there. When I turned back and looked I found that hardly eight or ten people were participating in meditation; the rest were sitting idle. You will get nothing by sitting idle. I am puzzled to see them at times sitting idly, doing nothing, when so many around them are totally in it, inspired by it, dancing and jumping. Have you a stone instead of a heart, that nothing moves you? Are you not stirred at all, seeing so many in rapture, in ecstasy? You are very intelligent – you control your feelings so that they cannot be affected. Please let yourself go! Do not sit here rigid like stone, where so many are dancing with open hearts and minds and have become as innocent as children. Let your stiffness go; be stirred!\nOne more point to remember: some of you think, “We shall do it when it becomes possible for us.” Ninety percent do it of their own accord, ten percent do not. But they themselves will have to break the barrier. So I tell you, those who think they cannot do it themselves should start doing it. They will have to make an effort for a couple of seconds only; it will become spontaneous from the third moment. When once the spring of water bursts forth, then water begins to flow down in a natural way. Now only one day is left, so I wish none to remain unaffected. Let all participate!\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"7966","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_heartbeat_of_the_absolute/part18/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_heartbeat_of_the_absolute/>The Heartbeat of the Absolute</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">18 At The Door Of Samadhi</h1><div class=post-meta>38 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;7966 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Heartbeat_of_the_Absolute/part18.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part17>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

VITAL AIR, AND LET MY BODY BE REDUCED TO ASHES.</p><p>O MY MIND FULL OF EGO AND DESIRES, NOW REMEMBER YOUR PAST ACTIONS,
REMEMBER YOUR PAST DEEDS.</p><p>Let life merge into that from which it was born. Let the shape lose
itself in that formlessness from which it was created. Let them be one
in that pure consciousness of being. Let the body be mixed with dust,
let it be merged into earth. In such a moment – and there are two such
moments – the sage addresses his egoistic mind full of desires: “O my
mind full of ego and desires, remind yourself of your past actions.”</p><p><br></p><p>There are two moments when this prayer may be truly offered. One is
the moment of death and the other is that of samadhi, deep meditation.
The one is when a person is on the threshold of death, and the other is
when he is at the greater death – samadhi – ready to merge himself like
a drop into the ocean. Most of the people who have explained this sutra
have interpreted it with reference to the first moment – that of
physical death. They have assumed that the sage is saying this at the
moment of death, when his whole existence is going to be merged into
that from where he came. But as I</p><p>see it, this remembrance is not made at all at the moment of death,
but at the moment of samadhi. It is not appropriate to the moment of
death, because there is no precognition of death. You never know at what
moment death will come. You know about it when it comes, but by that
time you are already dead. As long as death has not come one does not
know about it; and when it comes, the person who should know has already
passed away.</p><p><br></p><p>When Socrates was about to die, his friends asked him the reason why
he did not appear afraid, miserable or worried. Then Socrates said, “I
think this way: as long as death has not come, I am alive; when I am
alive, why should I worry about death? And who will be left to worry
about death when it actually comes and I am no more? I shall be
completely lost in death, nothing will be left behind, and if nothing of
me remains beyond death, then there is no reason to be afraid of
anything. On the other hand, if, as some people say, I shall not die
even after death, then there is no reason at all to worry about
death.”</p><p><br></p><p>As I said, this sutra is meaningful in two moments, either at the
moment of death or at the moment of samadhi. But we have no idea at all
of the moment of death – it is unpredictable, it cannot be foretold. It
comes all of a sudden, at any moment. It may happen any moment, there is
no foreknowledge of that moment, and this prayer can be made only when
there is foreknowledge; that is, when the sage knows, “I am about to
die, I am at the door of death.”</p><p><br></p><p>No, this is not a prayer made at the moment of death. It is made at
the time of the great death – samadhi means great death. I consider
mortal death an ordinary death because then only the body dies; the mind
does not die. I consider meditation, samadhi, the great death because
there is no idea, no remembering of the body at all in that condition;
the mind dies too. Hence I say that this prayer is made at the time of
samadhi, because the sage is asking his egoistic and desiring mind to
remember its past actions.</p><p><br></p><p>The second part of this sutra has been much misunderstood. The fact
is that such things as these are usually interpreted for us by pundits –
by our self-professed wise men. However intelligent their
interpretations and explanations may be, they commit a fundamental
error. They understand the words and principles of the scriptures
correctly, but they do not understand at all that which is hidden unsaid
behind the words and principles. The hidden essence is never contained
in the actual words of religions. It is to be understood from the gaps
between the words. The meaning is not in the lines but in the spaces
between the lines. So those who are unable to understand the spaces,
those who read only the printed words, cannot correctly interpret these
great sutras.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a movement called Krishna Consciousness in the West. I was
just looking at a book on the Ishavasya Upanishad by Swami Bhakti Vedant
Prabhupad – the leader of this movement. I was very much surprised to
read his interpretation of this sutra. The way he explains it is: “I am
on the point of dying, I am standing at the door of death. Therefore, O
God, please accept the sacrifices and renunciation I have made for you:
remember the actions I have performed for you.”</p><p><br></p><p>Not only is he unable to read the spaces between the words, he seems
unable to read even the words themselves, finding other words instead.
The sage is addressing his egoistic and desiring mind – there is no
question here at all of bringing God in. Nor does the sage say,
“Remember the actions which I performed for you, remember the sacrifices
I made for you.” But our business mind loves to interpret it in this
way. It will say at the moment of death, “O God, remember, I have given
a</p><p>lot of money to charities, I have built a temple for you, I have
built a dam for the village, and so on. O God, my time is over, now give
me a fitting reward for all the actions and sacrifices I have made for
your sake.”</p><p><br></p><p>“My egoistic and desiring mind.<span class=s4></span>” Will is the
channel of our desires, of the longings of the mind. It is</p><p>necessary to understand what will is so that the discussion may be
easily followed. Desires arise in the minds of all of us, but desire
does not become will till the ego is linked with it.</p><p><br></p><p>Egoistic desire becomes will. All people have desires, but these
desires remain mere dreams as long as they are not linked with ego, as
long as they do not become actions. To be translated into actions, a
desire has to be linked with ego. Then it becomes will. Vanity – ego –
is born to perform, to be. A desire to be the doer arises. You become
the doer as soon as ego is united with desire.</p><p><br></p><p>The sage says, “O my mind full of ego and desires, remember the
actions done by you.” Why does he say this, and not just once but twice?
Why? What need is there to remember this at the moment of samadhi or at
the moment of death? The sage is just making a joke. He is just laughing
at himself. At the gate of samadhi everything is passing away: the mind
is evaporating, the body is passing away, the spirit is disappearing –
everything is being absorbed. “O my mind, what happened to all that you
were thinking about? I did this – I did that. Where are all those ideas
that you were absorbed in, all those lines you were drawing on water?
Gone!”</p><p><br></p><p>Remember, all that you have done is passing away – even you are
passing away. Have a look back into the past, and remember with what
pride and vanity you thought, “I have done this!” With what dreams you
planned to do that! Remember all the footprints of your countless births
and travels. No trace of them is seen today, and today you are also
going to be nothing; no trace of you will remain. Today all the elements
will be absorbed in themselves. Today your entire journey will be
over.</p><p><br></p><p>So have a retrospective look, just once, and understand how great an
illusion you have been living in, what dreams you have been dreaming in
your madness, what hardships you have undergone for them, and how, lost
in anxiety, you have lived for the sake of these dreams. And when any of
your dreams were not fulfilled, think of the anguish and frustration you
passed through. And remember how overjoyed you became when a dream of
yours was fulfilled. Today all dreams and all achievements have
disappeared, and you too are about to pass away. Looking backwards,
remember all these things once more.</p><p><br></p><p>In great jest and joking the sage thus addresses his own egoistic
will, his vain mind. That is why, I tell you, this is not said at the
time of death but at the time of samadhi, because only the body perishes
at the time of death; the egoistic mind does not. You travel with your
mind even after death. That mind is the current of your countless
births. The body falls here, the mind travels on with you. Desires
accompany you. Ego travels with you. The memory of past actions goes
with you. The desire to accomplish those things you could not do goes
with you. Your entire mind goes with you. Only the physical body dies.
Mind leaves the body and catches hold of a new body – this mind that has
already caught hold of countless bodies in the past and will go on doing
so.</p><p><br></p><p>This is why those who know do not consider death to be real death –
because nothing perishes in it, we merely change our clothes. Understand
this well: the body is no more than clothes, no more than an outer
covering. Ordinarily we think that the body is born first and then the
mind is born in it. This</p><p>is wrong. During the last two hundred years Western thinking and
belief has spread the illusion that the body is created first, and that
the mind is then born in it, as a by-product, an epiphenomenon, as
simply one quality, one attribute of the body. It is similar to what the
ancient Charvakas used to say – that if you separate the ingredients
that are blended to make wine, and eat or drink them separately, there
will be no intoxication. The intoxicant is a by-product of the contents
being mixed together. It does not come from somewhere of its own accord,
it has no separate existence. It is produced by mixing a number of
things together. If the ingredients are separated it disappears. So the
ancient Charvakas used to argue that the body is composed of five
elements and mind is produced by the union of these five elements. Mind
is a by-product.</p><p>Western science is at present also in a state of ignorance in this
matter, believing that the mind comes after the body, as a shadow. But
in the East, those who have searched deeply into this subject maintain
that the mind is first and the body comes like a shadow after it. Let us
understand it in this way: what comes first in your life, the action or
the desire? First comes the desire in the mind, and then it is turned
into action – the action follows. But if anyone sees it from outside, he
will see the action first and will have to guess about the desire behind
the action. Suppose anger arose within me and I slapped you: first came
anger, first came the mind, then the hand was raised and the body
performed the action. But you will see my hand and the act of slapping
first. Even so, you will no doubt reason that I must first have become
angry. The bodily action is seen first, and as a result you start
guessing what is going on in my mind. But still those workings of my
mind came first, and the action of the body follows.</p><p>When a child is born we also see the body first, but those who know
deeply say it is the mind that comes first. That very mind causes the
body to be conceived and born. That mind creates the outline, the form
of this body. It is a sort of blueprint, it is an in-built program. When
a person dies, his mind goes on its journey with a blueprint, and that
blueprint maps itself into a new womb. And you will be surprised to know
this: we commonly believe that a body is produced when a man and a woman
make love, and then a soul enters the body, but on looking deeply into
this phenomenon it becomes evident that when a soul desires to enter a
womb, then both the man and the woman become eager for sexual activity.
Again, it is the body that is seen first, and we have to guess about the
mind. However, those who have looked deeply into this matter say that
when a soul desirous of entering a womb begins to wander around you,
then there arises a longing for sexual enjoyment. The mind is busy
getting a body ready for itself. You might not have thought of this
happening.</p><p>When you lie down to sleep at night – when sleep begins to descend
upon you and has almost caught you – bring your consciousness to the
last thought in your mind, then go to sleep; and when you wake up in the
morning and are ready to leave your bed, look back and find your first
thought on waking. You will be very surprised by the result. The last
thought of the night becomes the first one in the morning. In the same
way, the last desire at the time of death becomes the first desire at
the time of birth.</p><p>In death, the body disintegrates but the mind continues its journey.
The age of your body may be fifty years but that of your mind can be
five million. The sum total of all the minds born in all your births is
there in you even today. Buddha has given a very significant name to
this happening. He was the first to do so. He named it the storehouse of
consciousness. Like a storehouse, your mind has stored all the memories
of all your past births – so your mind is very old. And it is not that
your mind is the storehouse of only human births: if you were born as
animals or as trees, as is surely the case, the memories of all those
births are also present within you.</p><p>People who have conducted profound inquiries into the process of the
storehouse of consciousness say that if all of a sudden the feeling of
love swells in the mind of any man on seeing a rose, the reason is that
there is a memory deep within him of himself being a rose in the past,
which is rekindled on feeling its resonance in a rose. It is not
accidental if a person loves dogs very much. There are memories in his
storehouse of consciousness which make him aware of his great kinship
with dogs. Whatever happens in our lives is not accidental. A subtle
process of cause and effect is working behind these happenings. Though
the body perishes in death, the mind continues its journey and goes on
collecting memories. This is why sometimes you see forms in your mind of
which you would say, “They are not mine.” Sometimes you do certain
things that cause you to feel strange and say, “This has been done in
spite of me.” Suppose a person quarrels with somebody and bites him.
Afterwards he thinks, “How strange that I could bite him! Am I a wild
animal?” He is not today, but once he was; and a moment may come when
his hidden memory becomes so active that he behaves exactly like an
animal. All of us behave like animals on many occasions. That behavior
does not descend from the sky, it comes from the store within our
mind.</p><p>Our death is the death of our body only. Our mind full of ego and
desires does not die then, so there would have been no opportunity for
the sage to joke in this way if he were simply facing physical death.
This sutra is said at the time of samadhi. There is one distinguishing
feature of samadhi: its arrival can be announced beforehand. Death
surprises, samadhi is invited. Death happens, samadhi is planned.
Progressing step by step in meditation, man reaches to the state of
samadhi.</p><p>Understand the great significance of the word samadhi. At times the
word samadhi is also used to mean a grave. The grave of a sage is called
a samadhi. It is rightly called so. Samadhi is a kind of death, but a
profound and remarkable one. The body remains here after death, but the
mind within is destroyed. At this moment of the mind’s destruction the
sage says, “O my mind full of ego and desires, remember the actions done
by you in the past.” He is saying this because the mind has deceived him
in the past again and again; but today this very mind is being
destroyed.</p><p>“Depending and relying on my mind I lived my life. Through victory
and defeat, happiness and unhappiness, success and failure, hopes and
disappointments, I believed it would be always with me; but now I see it
was deceiving me. Leaning on it for support I made such a long journey,
but today I find that my support is perishing – disintegrating forever.
I thought it to be a sturdy boat, but today I find that it is itself
water merging into the river.”</p><p>In this moment the sage is addressing his mind: “O my egoistic mind,
remember the actions done by you, and actions desired and intended by
you. Remember the promises you made, consolations you offered. Remember
how much I confided in you. Remember what you induced me to do. Remember
the illusions you created in me. Remember the dreams you gave me.
Remember the follies you led me into. Now you yourself are going away,
and I am entering a region where you will not be. Till now you have
always persuaded me that where ego is not, where will is not, there is
no being. But I see today that you are going away, yet my being
remains.”</p><p>The mind always says, “If there is no will you will perish. You will
be unable to stand up against the conflicts of life. If there is no ego
in you, you will perish; you will not survive!” The mind always
instigates action, determination and fight. “If you don’t fight you will
be wiped out.” Surely, it is only natural for the sage on this day to
make fun of his mind, to say to the mind, “You yourself are perishing
today while I am intact. You are departing, I am not. Until now you have
deceived me, telling me that I shall not be saved if you are not. But
today you are leaving and I am not.”</p><p>The sage makes use of this moment to joke and jest for two reasons:
one is for his own mind, and the other is for the minds of those who
have not yet reached the door of samadhi and are busily occupied in a
thousand and one activities, whose minds are inducing them to do this
and to do that, whose minds still tell them, “Your life is wasted if you
fail to accomplish this, if you fail to build this palace,” whose minds
tell them, “You are worth nothing if you fail to accomplish this
mission, this adventure.”</p><p><br></p><p>To such people the sage is addressing his joke. He warns them to
think again, because the mind is the greatest deceiver. All our
deceptions are created by the mind. Each and every one of us lives in a
dream world, and the mind is so clever that it does not allow us to see
deep enough to reveal its deceptions. The mind is ready with a new
deception before we are able to see through the previous one. Before the
previous one is destroyed, mind fabricates another structure of
deception and entices us, saying, “Come in here, take rest here.”</p><p><br></p><p>If a desire were fulfilled and the mind were to allow you a single
moment’s interval, you would be able to see that nothing was really
achieved through the fulfillment of your first desire, for which you
endured so much trouble and anxiety. What did you really get? Less than
rubbish! But the mind does not allow even that much interval, that much
chance. The mind begins to plant the seeds of your next desire before
the last one is fulfilled. When a desire is fulfilled, it is found to be
useless and the interest is lost, but the mind immediately raises the
germ of a new desire. The race begins again: the mind never gives you an
opportunity to rest, to stop so that you can see what deception you are
in. When the ground disappears from under your feet, the mind does not
allow you to see the hole in its place, but offers you instead a new
piece of ground on which to stand.</p><p><br></p><p>I will tell you a short but interesting story which Buddha used to
narrate. You may have heard it, but you may not have interpreted it in
this way.</p><p><br></p><p>A man was running through a forest. Now, a man runs for one of two
reasons: either something in front attracts him, or else something from
behind is pushing him. This man was running for both reasons. He was
running in search of diamonds, because somebody had told him there was a
diamond mine in the forest. But he was running very fast at this moment
because a lion was after him. He had forgotten diamonds for the moment
and was thinking of how to save himself from the lion. He ran without
losing heart, but eventually reached a dead end. There was no road
ahead, only a deep and dangerous pit, and no way to go back – no way to
turn back, either through the forest or along the road. This is how you
run, in pursuit of diamonds or to save your life, and there is no going
back! All past time is gone forever. You cannot step back even an inch
into the past.</p><p><br></p><p>This man, pursued by the lion, was also unable to return, and the
road ahead was a dead end. Greatly afraid and seeing no way out, he did
what a desperate person would do. Catching hold of the roots of a tree,
he swung himself over the edge of the pit, thinking to climb out when
the lion had gone away. But the lion, standing near the mouth of the
pit, began to wait for him. The lion also has his desires! He thought,
“The man will have to come up in the end.” When the man saw the lion
waiting for him, he looked below for a way to save himself, and there,
roaring in the pit below, was a mad elephant.</p><p><br></p><p>We can imagine how pitiable and miserable his condition was – but not
yet pitiable enough. The trials and tribulations of life are without
number. No amount of conflict and upset can exhaust life’s</p><p>potential to create more. Suddenly he realized that the root he was
clinging to was slowly, slowly giving way. He looked up and saw two rats
busy gnawing away at the roots. One was white and the other black.
Buddha used to liken them to the days and nights which go on shortening
man’s life. We can understand how great a danger his life was in now,
with no escape possible. But no, the desires of man are amazing, and his
mind’s tricks of deception are wonderful. At that moment he saw a
honeycomb above the root, from which drops of honey were falling, one by
one. He put out his tongue, and a drop fell on it. He closed his eyes in
great joy, and said to himself, “How blessed I am, how sweet it is.” At
that moment there was neither the lion above nor the elephant below,
neither the rats cutting the roots nor any fear of death. In that moment
he forgot all his fears, and could only feel, “How sweet!”</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha used to say that each person is in this predicament, but the
mind goes on dripping drops of honey one after another. Man closes his
eyes and says, “How sweet!” This is the situation all the time. There is
death above and there is death below. Where life is, death is all
around. Life is surrounded by death, and the roots of life themselves
are being cut every moment. Every day, every moment, life is being
emptied. Just as the sand in an hourglass slips away from one moment to
the next, so our life is slipping away. But even so, if a drop of honey
falls we close our eyes and begin to dream of hopes. The mind tells us,
“See, how sweet it is!” When one drop is finished another is ready to
fall. The mind continues to sustain us with deception, drop by drop.</p><p><br></p><p>So the sage says, “O my egoistic and desiring mind, think of the
deceptions you have practiced upon me. Now remember this: all your past
actions and all your future plans – you were the instigator of those
actions, but today you meet your doom. You are at the gates of
destruction, you are about to be rubbed out.” At the gates of samadhi
the mind becomes a void; thoughts cease to come, doubts and
uncertainties of the mind disappear, the waves of the mind become calm.
There is absolutely no mind. When there is no mind, there is
samadhi.</p><p><br></p><p>I have told you that one meaning of samadhi is a grave – the grave of
a saint. The second meaning of samadhi is the condition of
doubtlessness, where doubts do not exist. It is worth knowing that where
the mind is, there are doubts and doubts and doubts; there can never be
doubtlessness. Mind is the great alchemist of doubt. As leaves sprout on
a tree, doubts sprout in the mind; doubtlessness never sprouts there, it
is there only when the mind is not. So when a person approaches me with
a request to make his mind free of doubts, I tell him, “Don’t bother
about that; you will never be able to make mind free from doubts. Leave
aside your mind and you will have doubtlessness.”</p><p><br></p><p>A friend was asking me this evening, “How can I be free from
greed?”</p><p><br></p><p>I told him, “You can never be free, because you yourself are greed.
As long as you are, you can never be without greed. If you are not,
greed will not be there.”</p><p><br></p><p>Doubtlessness in the mind is never possible; it comes only when the
mind is not. That is why no- mind is called samadhi – there is no doubt
at all. As long as the mind is, it will go on creating doubts upon
doubts. If you solve one doubt, it will give rise to another, and if
someone gives you a solution, the mind will create ten doubts out of
that solution.</p><p><br></p><p>A friend had informed me by letter that he was going to attend the
meditation camp. He saw me two days ago. He had written to me that his
mind was full of restlessness. After three days in the camp</p><p>his restlessness has disappeared. “After three days,” he told me, “my
restlessness has gone away, but is the restfulness I now feel not a
deception?”</p><p><br></p><p>I asked him, “Did your mind ever tell you that restlessness is a
deception?” He said, “The mind never said so.”</p><p>I asked, “How long have you been restless?” He replied, “I have
always been restless.”</p><p>His mind never questioned whether this restlessness was not a
deception. And now when he has become restful for the last three days,
the mind asks, “Is this peace real? Is it not a deception?” The mind is
amazing! Even if God meets you, your mind will raise a doubt: “I cannot
say definitely whether he is the real or an artificial one.” As long as
mind is, doubt will surely arise. So as long as you keep your mind you
will remain in great difficulty. Even if bliss comes, the mind becomes
suspicious and doubts its presence. The mind creates doubts, raises
suspicions and uncertainties, and gives birth to worries and
anxieties.</p><p><br></p><p>In spite of all this, why do we hold on to the mind so tight? If the
mind is the root of all these illnesses – as those who know tell us –
then what is the reason for clinging so tightly to it? For the answer,
look to the sage’s challenging remarks. The reason we cling to it so
tightly is that we are afraid that if the mind is not then we also shall
not be. In fact, intentionally or unintentionally, we have identified
ourselves with it. We have come to believe, “I am the mind.” As long as
this is our understanding we will continue to cling to all those
illnesses.</p><p><br></p><p>You are not the mind! You are that which knows the mind, which sees
it and which is fully conversant with it. To realize this you will have
to move a little away from it, you will have to stand off a little from
it, you will have to raise yourself a little above it. You will have to
stand on the shore to see the flow of the mind and to recognize it. How
can you leave it as long as you identify yourself with it? That would be
suicidal. To leave the mind means to die. So you will not be able to
leave it. He alone can give it up who knows, “I am not the mind.”</p><p><br></p><p>The first step into samadhi is this experience: “I am not the mind.”
This experience becomes more and more profound till it becomes so clear
and secure that the mind disappears completely. It disappears like the
flame of a lamp whose oil is finished. Even if the oil in the lamp is
finished, the wick will continue to burn as long as there is a little
oil in the wick – but now it will not burn for long. The sage is in a
similar condition. He has realized, “I am not the mind,” but the flame
continues burning now from the little oil remaining in the wick. The
sage is addressing this flame in its last burning moments, “O my
egoistic mind, you promised me to be always with me and to give me
light. But you are on the point of being extinguished. I see now that
the oil is finished, so I ask you how long can you last now? You are
completely finished, and yet I AM.” So he is telling his dying mind, “I
was always separate from you, but I always identified with you. It was
my delusion – samsara, maya – the great delusion!”</p><p><br></p><p>The sage is addressing himself, and as I told you, he is addressing
you also. Perhaps you can also realize it. Go back to your childhood and
remember how anxious you were to be top of the</p><p>class: how you lost sleep at night, how much the load of examinations
weighed on your mind, how you believed everything depended on them! But
today there is no examination, there is no class. Go back and check up:
what difference did it make whether you came first, or second or third –
or failed? Today you remember nothing of these happenings. Go back and
see. You picked a quarrel with someone: you thought it was a matter of
life and death. Today, after ten years, that quarrel looks like lines
drawn on water. Someone insulted you in the street and you struggled
with the problem of how to protect yourself from his abuse. Just look:
you were not destroyed. The abuse is not there now. Today you remember
nothing of it. Go back and see how much importance you attached to it
then. Is it that important today? No, it has no importance at all
now.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember, the thing which you value today will be worthless tomorrow,
so do not give it much importance today. Learn from your experience of
yesterday, and withdraw all this value you place on the things you do
now. The sage is telling his egoistic mind, on the strength of all his
experiences in life, “I considered you so very important, but I tell you
very definitely, at this moment of bidding you farewell, that you
practiced deception throughout. It was my foolishness not to see that I
was and am separate from you.”</p><p><br></p><p>When the mind vanishes everything vanishes, because it is the nucleus
to which everything is linked. The wheel of our entire life revolves on
it. Therefore the sage declares that the five elements in the body will
absorb themselves in their sources and everything will vanish, because
the mind – the nucleus joining all together – is disappearing today.</p><p><br></p><p>When he attained to the ultimate knowledge Buddha said a wonderful
thing. When his mind was destroyed for the first time and he entered
that state of void, he said exactly the thing which the sage of the
Upanishad has said. He said, “O mind, now I bid you farewell. Till now
you were needed, for I wanted to have a human form. But now I do not
need the human body so you can leave. Till now, needing the body, I
needed its architect, the mind, too. Nobody can be created without it.
Now I have my supreme abode. Now I have reached my destination. Now I
have reached that uncreated house, that dwelling in my self. Now you can
depart.”</p><p><br></p><p>Such sutras are very important for seekers of truth. There is no
benefit in committing them to memory. They are beneficial only if kept
in the heart. If they are memorized and repeated every day they become
stale. By and by their meaning is lost, and only dead words remain. But
if this fact – that the mind is nothing but a deception – is clearly
understood by you, then a new revolution will enter your life. I am not
speaking on these sutras with a view to your memorizing what I say and
becoming a pundit. No, you are already a pundit even before hearing me:
there is no need to increase the bulk of your knowledge. I speak on them
to give you a true picture of the realities of life. If remembering
happens, let it be through the awareness that these sutras bring in
throwing light on the way in which you live.</p><p><br></p><p>Chuang Tzu was a Chinese master. One evening he was passing with his
disciples through a cremation ground. A skull knocked against his foot.
He picked it up, touching it often with his head, and begged its pardon.
His disciples asked him, “Why are you doing this? We always thought you
were a man of wisdom. What is this madness showing in you now?”</p><p><br></p><p>Chuang Tzu replied, “You don’t understand. This cremation ground is
reserved for VIP’s. Only the most important people of the town are
cremated here.”</p><p>They said, “Whoever they may be, high or low, death is the great
leveler.”</p><p><br></p><p>Death is a great communist – it puts everybody on the same level. But
Chuang Tzu said, “No, I have to beg its pardon. Suppose this man was
alive now, what would be my position?”</p><p><br></p><p>The disciples said, “This man is not alive now, so why should you
worry about him?”</p><p><br></p><p>But Chuang Tzu took the skull home and kept it near his bed. Whoever
came to see him wondered why the skull was kept there. Chuang Tzu would
say, “Unintentionally my foot knocked against it. As the man is no more,
I have no opportunity to beg his pardon, so I am in a difficulty. To
solve the problem I have brought the skull home, and I go on begging its
pardon in the hope that one day I may be heard.”</p><p><br></p><p>Hearing this, people used to say to him, “What nonsense you are
talking!”</p><p><br></p><p>Then he would say, “The other reason I brought it here is for it to
be my constant reminder that sooner or later my skull will also be lying
in a burial ground and people will kick it here and there. I do not mind
that, but I am sorry I shall not be in a position to forgive anyone who
begs my pardon. So a great understanding about my skull has come to me
since I brought this skull home. Looking at it I shall remain calm and
unagitated even if someone kicks my skull!”</p><p><br></p><p>This is existential understanding, it is not intellectual. The
understanding has borne fruit, the person is transformed. In the same
way, if this sutra reaches your heart it will bear fruit when you are
doing something and your mind is urging you this way or that.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, this sutra should be given to a man like Morarji Desai,
whose mind is constantly planning to do this and to do that. The mind
goes on working like this until death, though it gets nothing from its
activity. Starting his career as a deputy collector, he has risen to the
position of deputy minister, but he has achieved nothing. Even if he
rises further, nothing fruitful, nothing worthwhile, is ever going to
come of it. The mind always keeps you in difficulty, whether it wins or
loses. The mind is like a gambler. If it loses, it thinks, “Let me play
once again – I may win.” And if it wins, it thinks, “Now my luck is in,
I must not miss it; let me play once again.” If he is winning, the
gambler becomes more hopeful, and goes on playing. If he loses, his mind
balks at the prospect of going away defeated: “Play once more, you may
win. Try again!”</p><p><br></p><p>So remember this sutra when the mind, like a gambler, urges you on,
win or lose! And address it thus: “O my mind full of ego and desires...
remember your past actions.” The result of this remembering will be that
your great attraction to a particular action will be lessened. Your
stupidity in thinking of yourself as a doer will be smashed, and you
will move closer towards samadhi. You will deepen the intensity of your
meditation. Bear in mind, unconsciousness or unawareness will not do. If
you go on remaining unaware and insensible to the workings of the mind,
then your mind will repeat what it did yesterday.</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps you do not know this, but your mind never does anything new
or fresh. It simply goes on repeating what it has done before. You were
angry yesterday, you were angry the day before yesterday; and after your
anger the day before yesterday you repented and vowed never to be angry
again. Yesterday you did the same again, and here you are again doing
the same thing today. Your</p><p>anger is old, and your repentance is also old. Day after day you are
repeating this sort of behavior. If you are unable to drop anger, at
least leave aside the repenting for it; break one of your old habits at
least! But you will not do this; your anger and your repentance go hand
in hand.</p><p><br></p><p>Man’s entire life is a repetition. It is no different from that of a
bullock working in a sugarcane mill. The bullock may think it is walking
a great distance because its eyes remain closed as it continues walking
round and round. It may think it has traveled all the earth and must be
nearing its destination. Like the bullock, the mind travels in a circle.
If a person keeps a daily diary, he will have to consider whether he is
anything more than a machine: the same activities, the same daily
routine, repeated over and over. After twenty years living together, the
wife knows what her husband will say when he comes home late in the
evening; she has twenty years’ experience. The husband also knows how
his wife will react to his excuses. Even so, both of them will go
through the same questions and the same answers.</p><p><br></p><p>Absorbed thus in the mechanical process of the mind, the man who
lives in unawareness misses all the opportunities he meets with in his
life – and the opportunities are not few, but we are so clever in
missing each of them. Every day there comes a fresh opportunity to be
new by not repeating the old – but we repeat the old. This happens
because we do not bear in mind this sutra... remember your past actions.
Before you get angry tomorrow, tell your mind, “O mind, remember all the
occasions you have become angry before.” First, stop for a couple of
seconds and remember the occasions of being angry before, and then be
angry. And I tell you, you will be unable to be angry then.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever the mind becomes full of desires and passions, address your
mind thus: “O my mind full of ego and desires, remember the desires you
have cherished in the past.” Keep your old experiences in mind before
embarking on a new journey, then you will not start on yet another
journey through the old. Your desire will stand amazed and puzzled! This
much awareness is enough to break the mind’s mechanical way of
working.</p><p><br></p><p>Gurdjieff has recorded in his memoirs that his father’s last advice
changed the entire course of his life. He was a small boy then, the
youngest in the house. His father, who was on his deathbed, called all
his sons and said something to each of them. When the youngest was
called the father said, “Come near me and bend your head towards me, I
want to tell you something which you should bear in mind throughout your
life. I have nothing else to give you. I want you to make me one promise
– that whenever an opportunity arises to commit an evil deed you will
wait for twenty-four hours. Of course, you may do it, but wait for
twenty-four hours before you do it. Give me this promise. If you want to
be angry, be fully angry; I do not forbid you, but do it after
twenty-four hours. If you want to murder someone, do it with all your
heart, but wait for twenty-four hours.”</p><p><br></p><p>Gurdjieff asked, “What is the purpose of this?”</p><p><br></p><p>His father said, “By following this advice you will be able to do the
deed in a better way. You will be able to plan it well, and it is my
life’s experience that there will be no mistake in your planning. My
gift to you is this experience.”</p><p><br></p><p>Gurdjieff has written, “This one piece of advice changed the course
of my life, because no one can do an evil deed if he waits even for
twenty-four seconds, let alone twenty-four hours.”</p><p>When you become angry, look at your watch and tell yourself, “I shall
be angry after one minute.” When the second hand completes one circle,
put down the watch and begin to be angry. You will not be able to be
angry because the glimpse and reflection of all the past occasions of
becoming angry will return to your mind during the sixty-second
interval. All the past repentances, all the vows taken by you, all your
decisions not to do that again, all these things will reappear in front
of you, and you will be unable to become angry.</p><p><br></p><p>But we do not wait in committing an evil deed; we only wait in doing
a good deed. A friend came today and expressed his desire to be
initiated into sannyas on his birthday, two or three months from now. No
one waits till his birthday if he wants to be angry! I asked him, “Is it
certain? How do you know where you will be on your birthday? It may even
be the day of your death!”</p><p><br></p><p>Even the next moment you cannot trust, what to say of two or three
months’ time! We postpone a good action, but the evil one we do
immediately in case we miss the opportunity of doing it. No, postpone
the evil, and do the good immediately. You cannot trust the next moment;
it may come, it may not come. If you miss the moment of doing good, the
opportunity may not come again, and if you wait – even for a moment – to
do an evil deed, I tell you, you will not be able to do it. One who is
strong enough to wait for a moment will be unable to do an evil deed. To
wait for a moment requires great strength. It is the greatest strength
in this world to wait for a second when the eyes begin to turn red with
blood and the fists begin to be clenched in anger.</p><p><br></p><p>The sage has created this sutra in order to make fun of himself – to
laugh at himself as well as at all of us. Enough for today.</p><p><br></p><p>Try to understand a few points about meditation before we begin. The
first thing is never to postpone it, not even for a second. Don’t think,
“I shall begin tomorrow.” It is to be practiced now.</p><p><br></p><p>I have to say something about those who are sitting behind me. I had
asked them to sit; it seems they thought they had simply to sit there.
When I turned back and looked I found that hardly eight or ten people
were participating in meditation; the rest were sitting idle. You will
get nothing by sitting idle. I am puzzled to see them at times sitting
idly, doing nothing, when so many around them are totally in it,
inspired by it, dancing and jumping. Have you a stone instead of a
heart, that nothing moves you? Are you not stirred at all, seeing so
many in rapture, in ecstasy? You are very intelligent – you control your
feelings so that they cannot be affected. Please let yourself go! Do not
sit here rigid like stone, where so many are dancing with open hearts
and minds and have become as innocent as children. Let your stiffness
go; be stirred!</p><p><br></p><p>One more point to remember: some of you think, “We shall do it when
it becomes possible for us.” Ninety percent do it of their own accord,
ten percent do not. But they themselves will have to break the barrier.
So I tell you, those who think they cannot do it themselves should start
doing it. They will have to make an effort for a couple of seconds only;
it will become spontaneous from the third moment. When once the spring
of water bursts forth, then water begins to flow down in a natural way.
Now only one day is left, so I wish none to remain unaffected. Let all

Number one, whom do the Upanishads call a man of wisdom? The root word from which this word comes is ved. The word ved means to know. The meaning of the words ‘man of wisdom’ is one who knows. What does he know? Someone knows mathematics, someone knows chemistry, somebody knows physics. There are thousands of things to know. Someone knows the scriptures. Some know all those matters of deep mystery told by the saints. But the Upanishads do not consider them wise.\nThis is a very strange and interesting thing. The accumulation of information is not knowledge according to the Upanishads. They call him a wise man who knows only that one great element\n– truth: that is, who knows himself, because one who knows himself, knows all. When he knows himself he becomes a mirror in which reflected images of all begin to appear. But the fact that he knows all does not mean he must be a great mathematician or a famous chemist or a great scientist. No, that is not the meaning. The only meaning of this sentence – “By knowing himself he knows all”\n– is that through knowing himself he comes to know that supreme, that purest, that occult element which is hidden within all. He knows the formula, the essence, whose play is all this. He knows that supreme law whose authority abides everywhere. He knows that supreme lord who is in everybody. He knows that supreme showman who holds in his hands the strings on which dance all the puppets!\nHe is not an expert – he is not at all an expert. If you ask him about a particular thing he may not know the answer. He knows the essential which is hidden in the entire universe. He does not know each leaf, but he holds the root in his hand. He knows that deep and mysterious great life-force; and no sooner does he know that than he becomes free from grief and attachment.\nThis is the characteristic of the wise man, and it is a strange one. It is not his capacity to reply to your questions, it is not that he will be able to solve your problems. It is that he becomes free from the effects of grief and attachment. A mathematician, however great an expert he may be, will not be free from grief and attachment. Let him be a great psychologist like Freud – and there have been very few psychologists like Freud in this world – his mind will still be that of an ordinary man, even after learning a great deal about the mind. It makes no difference, there is not the least transformation in his mind. He still becomes anxious, afraid, burning with anger and jealousy, and is as grieving and attached as any ordinary person. And the paradoxical thing is that he has more theoretical knowledge about fear, about jealousy, than perhaps any other person in the world. He has a fund of knowledge about sexuality, but even in old age it agitates his mind as much as it does anybody else’s mind.\nThe Upanishads do not consider such a person learned. They do not even consider his knowledge as true knowledge. They call it a fund of information. Such a person is an expert. Whatever is known about fear is known by him. He knows about the fear, but not the fear itself. If he had really known the fear he would be free from it. An expert in religious scriptures knows everything about religion, but does not know religion. He knows what the Vedas say, what the Upanishads say, what the Gita says, what the Koran says, what the Bible says – he knows all this. He knows what is said, but he does not know the one for whom it is said, in what way it is said, with what experience it is said.\nThe difference is like this – that a person knows everything about swimming but does not know how to swim. It is not difficult to know theoretically about swimming; a book on swimming can be studied. All the literature on swimming can be memorized. A person can be an expert on swimming and can answer any question asked about swimming. And yet, don’t push such a person by mistake into a river, because to know swimming is altogether a different matter.\nNor is it necessary for a person who knows swimming to know all about swimming. It is possible that he knows only swimming but is ignorant of any theoretical knowledge. But the entire theoretical knowledge of a person will not be of any use to him if his boat is sinking and his life is in danger. At such a time, the person who knows nothing about swimming but who knows swimming itself, will be able to swim and save his life. This is why the sage of the Upanishad correctly points out the fundamental characteristics of the truly learned person. He says they are the learned, the wise, who see all the animate and inanimate objects in themselves and see themselves in all animate and inanimate objects. Such people become free from grief and attachment.\nWhy has he grouped these two – grief and attachment – together? They are grouped together because these two are one; they are unavoidable, concomitant parts of the same mental condition. Of the two, one is never alone. So understand them correctly. The mind which is attached will have sorrow and grief also; and where there is no attachment, grief cannot be there. In fact, grief comes when the object of attachment is destroyed. There is no other cause for sorrow. Suppose I have an attachment to somebody: if he dies I am immersed in sorrow. Sorrow is like a shadow that follows attachment. If I have no attachment to anybody it is impossible to be sad, even if I wish to be.\nThere is a house to which I am attached. If it catches on fire I feel grief. There is grief immediately attachment is frustrated or fragmented – wherever it meets with some difficulty, wherever it is broken, wherever it is opposed. And remember, when grief comes you will have to create a new attachment to save yourself from the grief. When grief comes you will have to find a new object for your attachment, to save yourself from the grief, to get away from it. If a person whom you love dies, you are not able to forget him until you find a substitute to love. It is difficult to forget the old attachment until you throw it away and replace it by showing your love to the new substitute.\nSo grief comes when attachment is broken, and to run away from that grief we have to create new objects for our attachment. Thus this vicious circle goes on. Every attachment brings sorrow and every sorrow is suppressed by new objects of attachment. Sickness comes; medicine has to be given, and it causes other types of sickness. Then new medicines are given for the new sickness and those new ones give rise to new sicknesses. Thus the circle goes on. So it was a wise decision to group these two together.\nThis is why it is said that one who knows becomes free from grief and attachment. How can ideas of mine and thine come to one who sees himself in all animate and inanimate objects and sees all of them in himself? How is attachment then created? It is created only when you bind yourself to somebody, and say, “This is mine, the rest are not,” or when you say, “This building is mine, the rest are not mine.”\nWhen I was coming here, a certain woman came to see me. She said, “Because of your great grace my son’s shop was saved from catching fire. The adjoining building had caught fire, and it had got up to our shop. But our shop was saved.” She had brought sweets to offer to me. She was delighted that her son’s shop was saved. No, she was not at all grieved for the buildings that were destroyed in the fire, because she had no attachment to them. On the contrary, she was pleased because the building to which she was attached was saved.\nAttachment is always exclusive; it clings to one and leaves out the rest. It says, “This is my wife, this is my husband, this is my son, this is my house, this is my shop” – there is I in all these – “and I am not concerned with the rest!” It will not affect you in any way, it will make no difference to you, if anything happens to the rest. You are pleased that your own is saved.\nThe degree of attachment decreases as the field of attachment spreads. The greatest attachment is for oneself, because nothing appears more ‘mine’ than oneself. So if, for example, it appears that a boat is sinking, and a husband and a wife are in it, and the situation is such that only one of the two can be saved, then both will wish to be saved. If fire breaks out in a house, the owner will jump out first and then inquire about other members of his family. No sooner does a person know about the fire than he himself runs out. So, attachment is concentrated mostly around I; it is strongest linked\nto I. Then it gradually decreases as the field of ‘mine’ goes on expanding. It will be less towards the family, still less towards the town, still less towards the country, and even less towards the whole of humanity. And if people are living on some other planets, there will be no attachment towards them.\nScientists declare that there is life on at least fifty thousand other planets. We show no attachment in relation to them. Even towards humanity it seems minimal. We remain unconcerned and unaffected when seven hundred thousand people die in Pakistan. If one person dies in our family we are more grief-stricken than when so many die in Pakistan, and if one of our fingers is cut we experience more pain than we felt when those seven hundred thousand died. As we approach the ‘I’, attachment becomes more concentrated, and as we go further away from ‘mine’, its shadow becomes thinner and rarer.\nAttachment is the shadow of the ego. Attachments are immediately created wherever you see ‘I am’. But as I said, attachment is exclusive; to make attachment possible, something or somebody must be left out. Therefore, the sage says, one who has seen all animate and inanimate objects in himself, becomes nonexclusive; the feeling in him now is, “All are mine.” He becomes all-inclusive. Then attachment does not happen, because there is now no foundation for it.\nWhen all are ‘mine’, there is no purpose in calling anyone mine. There was a purpose to saying ‘mine’ as long as there was a purpose to saying ‘thine’ – there was someone who was not ‘mine’. So you made boundaries, you drew lines to show the limits of what was ‘mine’. You created a wall, a boundary. Beyond this limit, another world began with which you had no concern at all. “Whether it dies or is destroyed is no concern of mine.” On this side of the boundary is your world, for which you desire that there be no misery, no distress, no affliction, because you are grieved when it is in trouble.\nThe Upanishad says a man’s attachment vanishes when he sees himself not only in all animals, not only in all living things, but in all animate and inanimate objects, even in a grain of sand – that is to say, in whatever exists in the world. Then no attachment is left. Attachment is there while the boundary is there. Attachment cannot be limitless. Remember, limitless attachment is an impossibility. It lives within limits. As the boundary widens, the attachment weakens; and as the limits are narrowed, the attachment grows stronger. In limitlessness, attachment disappears.\nAnd then, how can grief be possible when attachment has disappeared? It does not exist without attachment. If there is no attachment, there is no grief. So the Upanishads call him a wise man who stands beyond both attachment and grief. And how does he stand beyond? He stands beyond by seeing himself in the whole of existence, which is there spread all around us but invisible to us because we are also there in it.\nThe following event happened in the life of Rabindranath Tagore. It is worth noting. He wrote prayers about God in the Gitanjali, for which he received the Nobel prize and became famous the world over. But there lived an old man near his house who began to harass him constantly. Wherever he met Rabindranath, he would hold on to him and ask, “Please tell me truly: have you known God?”\nThe old man was obstinate and Rabindranath, being an honest person, could not tell a lie. The old man looked so straight and deep into the eyes of Rabindranath that his hands and legs used to tremble. Here was the winner of the Nobel prize. Wherever he went he was much honored by the\npeople. People used to say, “Here is a living example of one whom the Upanishads call a Maharishi.” Yet here he was, being troubled by an old man from his neighborhood. And the harassment was not for just one day or one morning or evening, but continued every day, because the old man, having nothing to do, spent all his time sitting on a chair near the door of his house so Rabindranath found it difficult to avoid him.\nRabindranath has written in his diary that he found it very difficult to leave the house: “Before going out, I would inquire whether the old man was sitting there or not. Otherwise he would grab hold of me and ask, ‘Have you seen God? Have you known him?’ I used to tremble on hearing these questions because I know nothing about him. On hearing my answer the old man would laugh loudly and heartily. His laughing in that way spoiled my sleep, it began to haunt me; I began to be afraid of that old man. Once I thought, ‘I really created trouble for myself writing this Gitanjali.’ I thought, ‘That old man must have had some glimpse of God, otherwise he could not haunt me so.’” From his eyes it appeared he knew something, because Rabindranath could not get away with it by staring at him and repeating one or two lines of the Gitanjali in answer to his question.\nThus years passed, and the old man continued his haunting. Rabindranath has said: “A great load was removed from my mind on the day on which I could tell him, ‘I have known God.’” It was the beginning of the rainy season, and the first downpours were leaving puddles everywhere. Reservoirs and small pits on the roadsides filled with water. Frogs were croaking. It was morning and Rabindranath was tempted out by these changes in nature – the croaking of the frogs, the confused din of the falling rain, the new fragrance of the earth. He saw the old man was not on his usual seat. Perhaps he was not up yet.\nRabindranath ran out of his house. The sun was rising over the sea. He stopped at the seashore. The sun was shimmering on the water. He looked at the sun and its reflection, and then began to return to his home. The sun was reflected in each puddle, in each small pond, in every dirty ditch on the roadside. It was shining all around – in dirty puddles, on the sea, in clean small streams, on every side. Seeing all this, some music, some unknown, indefinable sound within began to play in Rabindranath’s heart.\nAs he returned, he was dancing. He was dancing because he saw that the reflection of the sun was never tarnished. He was dancing because he saw that the sun’s reflection was as fresh and clean in the dirty, muddy water as it was in the cleanest water. Reflection can never be dirty. How can it be dirty? Only water can be muddy and dirty. But the sun that looks into it, whose reflection appears in it, is not dirty. It is absolutely fresh and clean. No water can spoil it. This was a tremendous, a revolutionary experience for him. It meant that God, who is even within the worst of men, cannot be made dirty. The reflection of God in the most sinful person is as pure as it is in the most pious person. So he was returning dancing. A door had opened within.\nThat old man was sitting near his door. This was the first time he was not afraid of the old man, and for the first time the old man said, “It is all right, it seems you have known him.” And the old man approached Rabindranath and embraced him and said, “Your ecstasy, your dancing today, tells me that you have known him. Now I can honor you!”\nThen for three days Rabindranath remained in a state of ecstasy – in a state of madness. The members of the family were afraid to see this. Only the old man often used to come and tell them,\n“Be glad! Be joyful!” and began to inform the neighbors that he knew God. But the people in the house were very much afraid because Rabindranath was behaving in a very strange way. If he saw a pillar he would embrace it. If a cow passed by on the road he would embrace her, too. If he saw a tree he would embrace it. The people in the house thought he had lost his mind: “He has gone mad!” But the old man continued to say, “Don’t worry. He was mad until now, and now he is fine. Now he has begun to see, in all existence, that without which the song he was singing all this time was useless. It was only rhyme, a poor excuse for poetry. Only now, real music is born in his life.”\nRabindranath has written: “I could, by and by, control myself and bring my ecstasy under control, with great effort. Otherwise I yearned to embrace everybody and everything I met. Until now I was yearning and praying, ‘Oh God, where is your door?’ Now God was my door, and now wherever I looked I saw his door. Up until now I was searching for him and asking, ‘Where are you hiding?’ But now I was amazed because he was there already in me; there was nothing else but him.”\nHe who sees his presence in all existence or sees the entire existence in himself is truly a wise man; and such a person is beyond attachment and grief. Remember, there is neither happiness nor unhappiness in his life, there is only ecstasy. The purity of existence dances in his life. He is life itself, dancing and singing the praise of existence. His life itself is music; and all that brings grief, all that binds, all that becomes attachment, all that seems to bring happiness today but is the cause of unhappiness tomorrow – all these have no place in his life. He is now a mirror.\nWhen you stand before a mirror you are seen reflected in it, and when you go away from it, it at once leaves you. It does not hold on to you. No sooner are you gone from it than it becomes empty, without reflection. The mirror carries no attachment to you. That is why, when you stand aside, instead of in front of it, it is not broken into pieces out of sorrow for you. Its heart does not break into pieces. It does not say, “How can I now live without you?” Instead it says, “When you stood before me you were very beautiful, very good, and you showed me great favor; and when you leave me I feel no displeasure.” Nothing changes. The mirror is as joyful when it is empty and unreflecting as it was when it was filled with reflection.\nThus lives a learned man, like a mirror in the world. He is pleased with whatever comes before him. He is happy if he sees a flower and becomes its reflection, throws its reflection back, sees godliness in it. If there is no one in front of him – when all is empty – he sees godliness in emptiness. The very emptiness is godliness. Then he dances in that emptiness, and is in ecstasy even in emptiness.\nEnough for today. Now let us try to become mirrors ourselves.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3608","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_heartbeat_of_the_absolute/part8/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_heartbeat_of_the_absolute/>The Heartbeat of the Absolute</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">8 The Shadow Of The Ego</h1><div class=post-meta>17 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3608 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Heartbeat_of_the_Absolute/part8.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part7>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

sentence – “By knowing himself he knows all”</p><p>– is that through knowing himself he comes to know that supreme, that
purest, that occult element which is hidden within all. He knows the
formula, the essence, whose play is all this. He knows that supreme law
whose authority abides everywhere. He knows that supreme lord who is in
everybody. He knows that supreme showman who holds in his hands the
strings on which dance all the puppets!</p><p>He is not an expert – he is not at all an expert. If you ask him
about a particular thing he may not know the answer. He knows the
essential which is hidden in the entire universe. He does not know each
leaf, but he holds the root in his hand. He knows that deep and
mysterious great life-force; and no sooner does he know that than he
becomes free from grief and attachment.</p><p>This is the characteristic of the wise man, and it is a strange one.
It is not his capacity to reply to your questions, it is not that he
will be able to solve your problems. It is that he becomes free from the
effects of grief and attachment. A mathematician, however great an
expert he may be, will not be free from grief and attachment. Let him be
a great psychologist like Freud – and there have been very few
psychologists like Freud in this world – his mind will still be that of
an ordinary man, even after learning a great deal about the mind. It
makes no difference, there is not the least transformation in his mind.
He still becomes anxious, afraid, burning with anger and jealousy, and
is as grieving and attached as any ordinary person. And the paradoxical
thing is that he has more theoretical knowledge about fear, about
jealousy, than perhaps any other person in the world. He has a fund of
knowledge about sexuality, but even in old age it agitates his mind as
much as it does anybody else’s mind.</p><p>The Upanishads do not consider such a person learned. They do not
even consider his knowledge as true knowledge. They call it a fund of
information. Such a person is an expert. Whatever is known about fear is
known by him. He knows about the fear, but not the fear itself. If he
had really known the fear he would be free from it. An expert in
religious scriptures knows everything about religion, but does not know
religion. He knows what the Vedas say, what the Upanishads say, what the
Gita says, what the Koran says, what the Bible says – he knows all this.
He knows what is said, but he does not know the one for whom it is said,
in what way it is said, with what experience it is said.</p><p>The difference is like this – that a person knows everything about
swimming but does not know how to swim. It is not difficult to know
theoretically about swimming; a book on swimming can be studied. All the
literature on swimming can be memorized. A person can be an expert on
swimming and can answer any question asked about swimming. And yet,
don’t push such a person by mistake into a river, because to know
swimming is altogether a different matter.</p><p>Nor is it necessary for a person who knows swimming to know all about
swimming. It is possible that he knows only swimming but is ignorant of
any theoretical knowledge. But the entire theoretical knowledge of a
person will not be of any use to him if his boat is sinking and his life
is in danger. At such a time, the person who knows nothing about
swimming but who knows swimming itself, will be able to swim and save
his life. This is why the sage of the Upanishad correctly points out the
fundamental characteristics of the truly learned person. He says they
are the learned, the wise, who see all the animate and inanimate objects
in themselves and see themselves in all animate and inanimate objects.
Such people become free from grief and attachment.</p><p>Why has he grouped these two – grief and attachment – together? They
are grouped together because these two are one; they are unavoidable,
concomitant parts of the same mental condition. Of the two, one is never
alone. So understand them correctly. The mind which is attached will
have sorrow and grief also; and where there is no attachment, grief
cannot be there. In fact, grief comes when the object of attachment is
destroyed. There is no other cause for sorrow. Suppose I have an
attachment to somebody: if he dies I am immersed in sorrow. Sorrow is
like a shadow that follows attachment. If I have no attachment to
anybody it is impossible to be sad, even if I wish to be.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a house to which I am attached. If it catches on fire I feel
grief. There is grief immediately attachment is frustrated or fragmented
– wherever it meets with some difficulty, wherever it is broken,
wherever it is opposed. And remember, when grief comes you will have to
create a new attachment to save yourself from the grief. When grief
comes you will have to find a new object for your attachment, to save
yourself from the grief, to get away from it. If a person whom you love
dies, you are not able to forget him until you find a substitute to
love. It is difficult to forget the old attachment until you throw it
away and replace it by showing your love to the new substitute.</p><p><br></p><p>So grief comes when attachment is broken, and to run away from that
grief we have to create new objects for our attachment. Thus this
vicious circle goes on. Every attachment brings sorrow and every sorrow
is suppressed by new objects of attachment. Sickness comes; medicine has
to be given, and it causes other types of sickness. Then new medicines
are given for the new sickness and those new ones give rise to new
sicknesses. Thus the circle goes on. So it was a wise decision to group
these two together.</p><p><br></p><p>This is why it is said that one who knows becomes free from grief and
attachment. How can ideas of mine and thine come to one who sees himself
in all animate and inanimate objects and sees all of them in himself?
How is attachment then created? It is created only when you bind
yourself to somebody, and say, “This is mine, the rest are not,” or when
you say, “This building is mine, the rest are not mine.”</p><p><br></p><p>When I was coming here, a certain woman came to see me. She said,
“Because of your great grace my son’s shop was saved from catching fire.
The adjoining building had caught fire, and it had got up to our shop.
But our shop was saved.” She had brought sweets to offer to me. She was
delighted that her son’s shop was saved. No, she was not at all grieved
for the buildings that were destroyed in the fire, because she had no
attachment to them. On the contrary, she was pleased because the
building to which she was attached was saved.</p><p><br></p><p>Attachment is always exclusive; it clings to one and leaves out the
rest. It says, “This is my wife, this is my husband, this is my son,
this is my house, this is my shop” – there is I in all these – “and I am
not concerned with the rest!” It will not affect you in any way, it will
make no difference to you, if anything happens to the rest. You are
pleased that your own is saved.</p><p><br></p><p>The degree of attachment decreases as the field of attachment
spreads. The greatest attachment is for oneself, because nothing appears
more ‘mine’ than oneself. So if, for example, it appears that a boat is
sinking, and a husband and a wife are in it, and the situation is such
that only one of the two can be saved, then both will wish to be saved.
If fire breaks out in a house, the owner will jump out first and then
inquire about other members of his family. No sooner does a person know
about the fire than he himself runs out. So, attachment is concentrated
mostly around I; it is strongest linked</p><p>to I. Then it gradually decreases as the field of ‘mine’ goes on
expanding. It will be less towards the family, still less towards the
town, still less towards the country, and even less towards the whole of
humanity. And if people are living on some other planets, there will be
no attachment towards them.</p><p><br></p><p>Scientists declare that there is life on at least fifty thousand
other planets. We show no attachment in relation to them. Even towards
humanity it seems minimal. We remain unconcerned and unaffected when
seven hundred thousand people die in Pakistan. If one person dies in our
family we are more grief-stricken than when so many die in Pakistan, and
if one of our fingers is cut we experience more pain than we felt when
those seven hundred thousand died. As we approach the ‘I’, attachment
becomes more concentrated, and as we go further away from ‘mine’, its
shadow becomes thinner and rarer.</p><p><br></p><p>Attachment is the shadow of the ego. Attachments are immediately
created wherever you see ‘I am’. But as I said, attachment is exclusive;
to make attachment possible, something or somebody must be left out.
Therefore, the sage says, one who has seen all animate and inanimate
objects in himself, becomes nonexclusive; the feeling in him now is,
“All are mine.” He becomes all-inclusive. Then attachment does not
happen, because there is now no foundation for it.</p><p><br></p><p>When all are ‘mine’, there is no purpose in calling anyone mine.
There was a purpose to saying ‘mine’ as long as there was a purpose to
saying ‘thine’ – there was someone who was not ‘mine’. So you made
boundaries, you drew lines to show the limits of what was ‘mine’. You
created a wall, a boundary. Beyond this limit, another world began with
which you had no concern at all. “Whether it dies or is destroyed is no
concern of mine.” On this side of the boundary is your world, for which
you desire that there be no misery, no distress, no affliction, because
you are grieved when it is in trouble.</p><p><br></p><p>The Upanishad says a man’s attachment vanishes when he sees himself
not only in all animals, not only in all living things, but in all
animate and inanimate objects, even in a grain of sand – that is to say,
in whatever exists in the world. Then no attachment is left. Attachment
is there while the boundary is there. Attachment cannot be limitless.
Remember, limitless attachment is an impossibility. It lives within
limits. As the boundary widens, the attachment weakens; and as the
limits are narrowed, the attachment grows stronger. In limitlessness,
attachment disappears.</p><p><br></p><p>And then, how can grief be possible when attachment has disappeared?
It does not exist without attachment. If there is no attachment, there
is no grief. So the Upanishads call him a wise man who stands beyond
both attachment and grief. And how does he stand beyond? He stands
beyond by seeing himself in the whole of existence, which is there
spread all around us but invisible to us because we are also there in
it.</p><p><br></p><p>The following event happened in the life of Rabindranath Tagore. It
is worth noting. He wrote prayers about God in the Gitanjali, for which
he received the Nobel prize and became famous the world over. But there
lived an old man near his house who began to harass him constantly.
Wherever he met Rabindranath, he would hold on to him and ask, “Please
tell me truly: have you known God?”</p><p><br></p><p>The old man was obstinate and Rabindranath, being an honest person,
could not tell a lie. The old man looked so straight and deep into the
eyes of Rabindranath that his hands and legs used to tremble. Here was
the winner of the Nobel prize. Wherever he went he was much honored by
the</p><p>people. People used to say, “Here is a living example of one whom the
Upanishads call a Maharishi.” Yet here he was, being troubled by an old
man from his neighborhood. And the harassment was not for just one day
or one morning or evening, but continued every day, because the old man,
having nothing to do, spent all his time sitting on a chair near the
door of his house so Rabindranath found it difficult to avoid him.</p><p><br></p><p>Rabindranath has written in his diary that he found it very difficult
to leave the house: “Before going out, I would inquire whether the old
man was sitting there or not. Otherwise he would grab hold of me and
ask, ‘Have you seen God? Have you known him?’ I used to tremble on
hearing these questions because I know nothing about him. On hearing my
answer the old man would laugh loudly and heartily. His laughing in that
way spoiled my sleep, it began to haunt me; I began to be afraid of that
old man. Once I thought, ‘I really created trouble for myself writing
this Gitanjali.’ I thought, ‘That old man must have had some glimpse of
God, otherwise he could not haunt me so.’” From his eyes it appeared he
knew something, because Rabindranath could not get away with it by
staring at him and repeating one or two lines of the Gitanjali in answer
to his question.</p><p><br></p><p>Thus years passed, and the old man continued his haunting.
Rabindranath has said: “A great load was removed from my mind on the day
on which I could tell him, ‘I have known God.’” It was the beginning of
the rainy season, and the first downpours were leaving puddles
everywhere. Reservoirs and small pits on the roadsides filled with
water. Frogs were croaking. It was morning and Rabindranath was tempted
out by these changes in nature – the croaking of the frogs, the confused
din of the falling rain, the new fragrance of the earth. He saw the old
man was not on his usual seat. Perhaps he was not up yet.</p><p><br></p><p>Rabindranath ran out of his house. The sun was rising over the sea.
He stopped at the seashore. The sun was shimmering on the water. He
looked at the sun and its reflection, and then began to return to his
home. The sun was reflected in each puddle, in each small pond, in every
dirty ditch on the roadside. It was shining all around – in dirty
puddles, on the sea, in clean small streams, on every side. Seeing all
this, some music, some unknown, indefinable sound within began to play
in Rabindranath’s heart.</p><p><br></p><p>As he returned, he was dancing. He was dancing because he saw that
the reflection of the sun was never tarnished. He was dancing because he
saw that the sun’s reflection was as fresh and clean in the dirty, muddy
water as it was in the cleanest water. Reflection can never be dirty.
How can it be dirty? Only water can be muddy and dirty. But the sun that
looks into it, whose reflection appears in it, is not dirty. It is
absolutely fresh and clean. No water can spoil it. This was a
tremendous, a revolutionary experience for him. It meant that God, who
is even within the worst of men, cannot be made dirty. The reflection of
God in the most sinful person is as pure as it is in the most pious
person. So he was returning dancing. A door had opened within.</p><p><br></p><p>That old man was sitting near his door. This was the first time he
was not afraid of the old man, and for the first time the old man said,
“It is all right, it seems you have known him.” And the old man
approached Rabindranath and embraced him and said, “Your ecstasy, your
dancing today, tells me that you have known him. Now I can honor
you!”</p><p><br></p><p>Then for three days Rabindranath remained in a state of ecstasy – in
a state of madness. The members of the family were afraid to see this.
Only the old man often used to come and tell them,</p><p>“Be glad! Be joyful!” and began to inform the neighbors that he knew
God. But the people in the house were very much afraid because
Rabindranath was behaving in a very strange way. If he saw a pillar he
would embrace it. If a cow passed by on the road he would embrace her,
too. If he saw a tree he would embrace it. The people in the house
thought he had lost his mind: “He has gone mad!” But the old man
continued to say, “Don’t worry. He was mad until now, and now he is
fine. Now he has begun to see, in all existence, that without which the
song he was singing all this time was useless. It was only rhyme, a poor
excuse for poetry. Only now, real music is born in his life.”</p><p><br></p><p>Rabindranath has written: “I could, by and by, control myself and
bring my ecstasy under control, with great effort. Otherwise I yearned
to embrace everybody and everything I met. Until now I was yearning and
praying, ‘Oh God, where is your door?’ Now God was my door, and now
wherever I looked I saw his door. Up until now I was searching for him
and asking, ‘Where are you hiding?’ But now I was amazed because he was
there already in me; there was nothing else but him.”</p><p><br></p><p>He who sees his presence in all existence or sees the entire
existence in himself is truly a wise man; and such a person is beyond
attachment and grief. Remember, there is neither happiness nor
unhappiness in his life, there is only ecstasy. The purity of existence
dances in his life. He is life itself, dancing and singing the praise of
existence. His life itself is music; and all that brings grief, all that
binds, all that becomes attachment, all that seems to bring happiness
today but is the cause of unhappiness tomorrow – all these have no place
in his life. He is now a mirror.</p><p><br></p><p>When you stand before a mirror you are seen reflected in it, and when
you go away from it, it at once leaves you. It does not hold on to you.
No sooner are you gone from it than it becomes empty, without
reflection. The mirror carries no attachment to you. That is why, when
you stand aside, instead of in front of it, it is not broken into pieces
out of sorrow for you. Its heart does not break into pieces. It does not
say, “How can I now live without you?” Instead it says, “When you stood
before me you were very beautiful, very good, and you showed me great
favor; and when you leave me I feel no displeasure.” Nothing changes.
The mirror is as joyful when it is empty and unreflecting as it was when
it was filled with reflection.</p><p><br></p><p>Thus lives a learned man, like a mirror in the world. He is pleased
with whatever comes before him. He is happy if he sees a flower and
becomes its reflection, throws its reflection back, sees godliness in
it. If there is no one in front of him – when all is empty – he sees
godliness in emptiness. The very emptiness is godliness. Then he dances
in that emptiness, and is in ecstasy even in emptiness.</p><p><br></p><p>Enough for today. Now let us try to become mirrors ourselves.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part7>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

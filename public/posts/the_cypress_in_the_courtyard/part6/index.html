Deva means divine and anuragi means lover – a lover of God.

Love is going to be your path. It is easy and yet it is difficult. Easy if you can allow yourself to surrender. Difficult if the ego goes on resisting, showing defense. It is in your hands.\nAnd when I say that love is your path, I mean change every moment of your life into a loving energy. If you are walking on a street, feel as if you are full of love, diffusing love. Nobody is there; you are not addressing your love to anybody in particular, just unaddressed... just as a flower sends its fragrance unaddressed. The bees, the birds, the stones, all need love. Every situation can be converted into a love situation. If you are sitting in your room alone, fill the whole room with love. Sometimes even touch things with a deep love, gratitude, as if they are persons.\nOrdinarily just the opposite is happening in the world: we touch persons as if they are things. We should touch things as if they are persons.\nThat will start a transformation in your energy. By and by, you will see that you are riding on a great wave. It is the same energy that we are diffusing unnecessarily, sometimes as anger, sometimes as jealousy, sometimes as possessiveness, sometimes as anxiety. All these things, negativities, are nothing but energy unused because we have not been able to direct the energy to its fulfillment and to its destiny. It needs some ways to release itself otherwise it will become too heavy.\nGod goes on giving you infinite energy every moment and we don’t know how to use it. That unused energy has somehow to get out of your system, otherwise you will be dead. It has to move so that God can pour new energy into you.\nOnce you start pouring your energy as love, anxiety disappears automatically. It is not a problem. This word ‘anxiety’ is very good. It comes from a latin root ‘augustus’ which means narrowness. When your energy has no way to move or you have so much energy and the way is too narrow so that the energy feels confined, hemmed in, tension is created. Then you find some way or other – even if it is destructive – to throw it somehow.\nSo to me, anger, hatred, anxiety, are not problems. They are there because you have not yet enjoyed love. So forget all about them and just move into love. Suddenly you will see that your anger is no more there. Anxieties have disappeared because the whole energy is being used by love, and love is never narrow. It is as big as God, as infinite as God, and once you are in deep love you are divine. Love makes everybody divine.\nIf you don’t love, you are not even human: If you love, you are divine.\nSo this has to be your path and the name Anuragi will remind you continuously. [The new sannyasin says he is a law librarian.]\nVery good. So treat books as persons. They are, mm?\n[Osho suggested groups that he should do, first Tathata – the total acceptance group]\nTotal acceptance is the very base of love. Rejection creates hatred and acceptability creates love. When you love somebody, you accept them totally and unconditionally. You don’t want them to become somebody else. You love them as they are. You delight in the way the other is. You don’t have a ‘should’. You don’t try to improve. And when you love yourself, then also you stop improving upon yourself because all improvement shows a deep rejection.\nSo I don’t teach improvement. I teach transformation.\nAnand means bliss and smaran means remembering, remembrance. It means a constant remembrance; what Sufis call ‘zikr’ – a constant remembrance of being blissful. Don’t forget it. Nothing else is needed, just a remembrance that one is blissful. One is blissful, only one has forgotten it. Only the language has to be reclaimed.\nBliss is not something to be achieved. It is already there, because you have never been away from it. One cannot be away from it because bliss is one’s nature. It is the deepest core of one’s being, so one can forget. It is very easy to forget because it has always been there; so much so that one tends to forget it.\nIt is just like a fish in the ocean. The fish cannot feel or know the ocean because it has always been in it. Once it has been thrown on the bank, for the first time it comes to know the ocean. When we are separated from something, we come to know it; that is the problem.\nWe are never separate from our nature... we are never separate from God. That’s why, how, we have forgotten all about God and we go on asking, ‘Where is God?’ And you are God. The seeker is the sought.\nThis name I give to you to continuously remember. Walking, sitting, eating, talking, alone or together, always remember again and again, ‘I am blissfuL’ Let it become a chanting inside – ‘I am blissful.’ Let it move in with the breath and out with the breath – ‘I am blissful’ – so that it becomes almost like breathing. By and by, something will explode within you and there will be no need to remember. You will know.\nRemembrance is needed just to clear the way for knowing. Once you know, there is no need to remember. This constant remembering is just like a hammer. So keep this in the memory...\n[The new sannyasin says: I’m having a hard time loving myself. I’m always putting myself down. It’s something that I’ve just learned to do.]\nThat’s a very significant insight – to know that one does not love oneself, to know that it is very hard to love oneself.\nThis is not only the case with you. This is the case with the whole humankind; the whole of humanity suffers from it. We never think about it. We always think in terms of loving somebody else. The man thinks to love the woman, the woman thinks to love the man; the mother thinks to love the child, the child thinks to love the mother; friends think to love each other. But unless you love yourself it is impossible to love anybody else, because the very thing will be missing.\nYou can love somebody else only when you have love within you. You can share something only when you have it.\nBut the whole humanity has lived under this wrong ideology, so we take it for granted – as if we love ourselves and now the whole question is of how to love the neighbour. It is impossible! That’s why there is so much talk about love and the world remains ugly and full of hatred, war and violence and anger.\nThis is a great insight to come to – that you don’t love yourself. It is really hard to love oneself because we have been taught to condemn ourselves and not to love. We have been taught that we are sinners. We have been taught that we are not of any worth. Because of that it has become difficult to love. How can you love a worthless person? How can you love somebody who is already condemned?\nBut it will come. If this insight has come, there is nothing to be worried about. One window has opened. You will not be inside the room for long – you will jump out. Once you know the open sky, you cannot remain confined in a stale world. You will come out of it.\n[A sannyasin said that she had been doing something which was like Yoga but not as structured or as formal. She simply allowed her body to move and take postures that it felt good in.\nOsho said this exercise was good and could be very helpful.]\nThat is not what is ordinarily called Yoga, but there is a very esoteric tradition in India which they call Sahaj Yoga – spontaneous Yoga. There is no need to follow any form, any rigid discipline, but just allow the body to have its way. The body knows more than the mind, so if you fix some pattern and\ntry to force it on the body. it is the mind dominating the body and the mind does not know as much as the body does.\nThe mind is a very late arrival. The body has existed for almost three million years and the mind has not existed for more than twenty-five thousand years a very late arrival. If we divide the whole of history into twenty-four hours, the mind came only two minutes ago. So the mind is very immature, childish. To try any discipline through the mind on the body is putting things topsy-turvy.\nI’m perfectly in favour of spontaneous postures. Allow the body to have its own way. Listen to the body and what it says. The needs differ from moment to moment. Today the need is something different and tomorrow one never knows. Today the body may like to move in a certain posture and tomorrow it may not like it; the need may not be there. But if you are trying to enforce something from the mind, you go on enforcing it without listening to the body. Then the whole thing becomes formal, and a mind-trip.\nSo, good... but one thing I would like to add to whatsoever you are doing is to remember that the mind is very tricky. What you call your feelings may again just be a mind thing. It may not really be of the body, because thought is of the mind and feeling is also. The mind has become so predominant. It monopolises; it doesn’t allow anything. Even if you feel, you feel through the mind. As in this, the mind interprets everything.\nHave you heard anything about Subud? It will be very helpful for you. What Subud people call Latihan will be exactly the thing for you. So after the camp I will tell you how to move into Latihan.\nYou don’t need to do anything with the mind. Simply stand in a loose posture and wait for God, for the whole, to work in you. Then you do whatsoever you want to do in a deeply prayerful mood – ‘I am at Thy will’ – and just relax.\nIt is just like when people do automatic handwriting. They just keep the pen in their hand and wait. Suddenly some energy possesses the hand and the hand starts moving. They are surprised – their own hand is moving and they are not moving it! Wait exactly like that, and after three, four minutes, suddenly you will see a few jerks coming to the body and energy descending in vou. Don’t get scared because It Is very scarey You are not dolng It. In tact you are just a witness; it is happening.\nMove with it. The body will start taking many postures – moving, dancing, swaying, trembling, shaking; many things will happen. Go on allowing; not only allowing but cooperating. Then you will come exactly to what we call Sahaj Yoga.\nLatihan is nothing new. The word is new. Subud is not something new. It is just a new version of Sahaj Yoga – spontaneous Yoga. You leave everything to the divine, because the mind is tricky. Soon you will see the difference because you will just be a watcher. You will be surprised because your hand will be moving and you are not moving it at all. After a few days of relaxing into it, even if you want to stop, suddenly you will not be able to; you will see that you are possessed. So one has to pray in the beginning and say, ‘For twenty minutes take possession of my being and do whatsoever you want to do: Thy will be done; Thy kingdom come.’ Let that attitude be there and just relax. God will start dancing in you and will take many postures. The body needs will be fulfilled, but not only that – something higher- than the body, greater than the body, some deep needs of consciousness will be fulfilled.\nI can see that you have been seeking and searching. You don’t know exactly what you are seeking but nobody knows unless one finds. One goes on groping in the dark.\nMuch is going to happen. First do the camp as totally as possible.\n[An elderly sannyasin says: I have quite spontaneous experiences and sometimes they happen slowly, but also sometimes they are quite ferocious, quite violent.]\nSometimes they can be, but everything is alright. God is both beautiful and ferocious, mysterious and terrible. He has to be because He is all. He is the day and the night, summer and winter. He is life and He is death, so all contradictions are doing in Him.\nSometimes experiences can be very very ferocious. Enjoy that too. That is going to help.\n... You have to let it go. Whatsoever the experience, you are not to create any resistance; you have simply to go into it. Even if it is ferocious, move into it and suddenly you will see the beauty of it. The ferocious is also beautiful once you allow it.\nIt is just like a cyclone in the ocean – ferocious, dangerous – but once you know that that too belongs to God, you are on the shore. You can enjoy it... it is beautiful. The very wildness gives it a certain depth.\nSo both are beautiful. Simply relax and enjoy. Your experiences are going very very well and in the right direction. Much more is going to happen... but you are resisting a little. You are a little afraid. That fear has to be dropped. In these few weeks that you are here, we will try so you can drop the fear. Even if sometimes you feel that it is almost maddening, don’t be afraid.\nIt happens because of our capacity. Our capacity is small and sometimes God pours so much into us that it is maddening. It is almost two hundred volts in a one-hundred-voltage wire, so everything goes crazy.\nAllow it, because that is the only way to increase your capacity. It will happen many times, because more experiences will be coming. The more ready you become, the more will be coming, and there is no end to it.\nIn God there is only the beginning of the journey. There is no end to it.\nHe goes on becoming more and more wild, the more you allow. But it is tremendously beautiful. Once you can enjoy it, you are simply grateful. You should be grateful.\n[A young woman says she has always been afraid of the dark... afraid to sleep on her own in a room.]\nDo a few groups here... things will change.\nIt is just through wrong associations from childhood. Many children have them because parents are not alert, so children suffer for the whole of their life. Sometimes parents even make them afraid of\nthe dark. They use it as a technique, a device to make the child afraid, because when the child is afraid he can be controlled. But it can create deep problems inside.\nDarkness is one of the most beautiful things in the world, so you are missing a lot. And to be alone has such beauty. That too you are missing, because if you are afraid of darkness, you will be afraid of aloneness. Darkness is very silent. It has nothing in it to create fear in you. It is just through an association from childhood. Aloneness is very very pure. The greatest experience of life happens in aloneness and in darkness.\nSo this fear has to be dropped. We will find ways how to drop it, because you are missing much. Because of the fear you will not be able to love, because these are associated problems. If there is too much fear, the whole of your energy becomes concerned with fear. And love is the opposite of fear. So if fear is there, you will not be able to love. Once fears disappear you will be able to love. ... it will go don’t be worried.\n[Osho gives her sannyas.]\nNow I will protect you. Don’t be afraid of any darkness or anything. This will be your new name: Ma Prem Chidambara.\nPrem means love, because when fear goes, love will appear. Once fear is dropped, the same energy that is involved in fear will be released in love. Prem means love.\nAnd Chidambara is one of the most beautiful names in India. It means sky of consciousness, expansion of consciousness. So get in tune with this new name. It will mean the sky of love and consciousness. That is the goal of the whole of humanity and they both come together.\nWhen you love, you become more conscious. If you become more conscious, you love more. Love is the only religion, but it appears only when fear is completely dropped.\nBut it will go. I can see that there is no trouble. And change to orange !\n[A middle-aged visitor explained that she works for a dutch airline and while she doesn’t particularly enjoy it, she needs the money. She said she had trouble communicating with young people.]\nSo I can make you younger! That will be easier. Don’t leave, because you will have to earn money and you have only five more years to go. I will make you a little younger and you will be able to relate. It is just some attitude that is creating the trouble, not the job.\nAlways remember that whenever there is a gap, it is the older person’s responsibility to bridge it because you are more mature and more understanding. Young people are too young. They don’t know anything about life yet, so if they don’t create any bridge, it can be forgiven. But you can create a bridge more easily. But it will happen.\nYou can do a few groups here. My young people will pull you back.\n[She answers: I have no difficulty with young people if they are not narrow-minded.]\nThat is difficult. How can one change them? We can only change you. You are here, so something can be done.\nWhether they are narrow-minded or not, that is their problem. It should not create a problem for you. That is their problem and they will suffer for it. Why should you be worried?\nSo do a few groups here. Only in a Group will you be able to see how you are creating your problem.\nBy leaving your job you will create problems. You will always feel that you have not taken the right decision if you leave. It will be like an escape because you could not cope with it and you will never be able to forgive yourself. It will linger in your mind continuously. If you want to leave the job, you can, but first settle this problem.\nOnce there is no problem and you want to leave, leave, but to leave because of the problem is not good. My suggestion is always that if you want to leave a certain thing, be successful in it and then leave it, but never leave it as a failure.\nWhen you are winning, leave. But when you are feeling that you are defeated, stick to it. Wait for the right moment – when you are winning – and then leave. Then you will come out of it cleanly.\n[Osho gives her sannyas.]\nDeva means divine and Vibhuti means gift – God’s gift. Look at yourself in that way. Our life is a gift, a tremendously valuable gift. We may realise it, we may not, but it is an infinite gift.\nSo think in terms of life being a gift from God and then you will take more care of your life. You start loving your life. Then you don’t waste it. It is precious... each moment is tremendously precious, and once it is gone it is not going to come back.\n[A visitor says: My husband divorced me two years ago and my children are grown up and have left home.]\nMm! So this is an opportunity! Don’t take it wrongly. If you are left alone you can grow. Many people are suffering because the husband has not left yet [laughter].\nSo feel happy. This is a great opportunity to use. People say to me, ‘What can we do – so many children and the husband.’ They have to devote their lives to them. You are simply alone. So don’t\ntake it wrongly.\n[She adds: But there are difficulties for my children. I feel very sorry for them.]\nOne should be sorry for oneself, because we cannot do anything else. All that you can do is about you. You will be gone soon but the children will be hereAnd nobody can manage anybody else’s\nlife.\n’though they are with you,\nyet they belong not to you.\nYou may give them your love but not your thoughts,\nfor they have their own thoughts.\nYou may house their bodies but not their souls, for their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit even in your dreams.’\nGod will take care. It is none of our business to be too concerned. Whatsoever we can do, we do, but one should not hanker about things going the way one wants. That is very egoistic. You have given birth to a child, but once he is out of the womb, he is free of you.\nFirst he depended for his breath on you when he was in the womb. Then he will take his own breath. You don’t say. ‘What are you doing? Are you trying to be free of me? Trying to be independent?’ You feel happy that your child is breathing.\nFirst he will take milk from you, then one day he will start eating on his own. First he will go on clinging to your apron and then one day he will leave it.\nYou will be happy because the child is growing, becoming mature. Then finally one day he falls in love with a woman. He has found his woman, so he will go on his own way. Bless them, and whatsoever happens, they have to find their own life and their own meaning to life.\nNow you are free. Just try to find your meaning, your life, your goals, and devote the few days that are left to the search of the ultimate. Don’t be concerned with ordinary things.\nI have never seen a single parent who is happy about their children. I have heard a jewish joke.…\nA jewish woman died and the first thing she asked when she got to heaven was if she could see Mary. So it was arranged She went to see Mary and she said, ‘I have only one question to ask. You must be the happiest woman in the world. Your son is worshipped by millions.’\nMary said ‘What! I always wanted him to become a doctor!’ [laughter]\nNobody is ever happy. Even the father of Buddha was not happy. He was very very annoyed because his son turned out to be a beggar. He became a sannyasin and the father was hoping he would become an emperor. He crushed all his father’s hopes.\nWhatsoever happens to the children – good or bad; even if they become saints – it doesn’t matter. One thing is certain – that the child is not here to fulfill your expectations. That much is certain. The child is here with his own destiny, and he will unfold his own destiny. You are trying somehow to direct his destiny and that is going to be frustrated.\nSo if the child becomes a thief or a murderer, of course the parents feel bad, and it looks logical. But even if he becomes a Jesus or a Buddha, then too they feel frustrated because they have their own ideas and the children try to do their own thing.\nDon’t be concerned; it is okay. Accept it and bless them. They have to find their own ways. Who are we to interfere? And how can we? Pray for them but leave them on their own. You try to grow yourself.\nAnd this is my feeling: if you change, much will change. Even in your relationship with your children, much will change. When you change, the relationship cannot be the same. There is a possibility that they will look at you again with a different view, with different eyes. But you change. It is irrelevant what they do.\nFor one month just be here with me and allow me to work a little. If you are preoccupied with the children and your problems there, you will not be here. Forget all about Holland. It doesn’t exist for one month. Meditate, enjoy, celebrate and be happy for this one month.\n[The ashram Rolfer says: I’ve been here for over a year now and a lot of things have happened to me and yet now I feel that I’m back in an old space where everything just seems futile... ]\nEverything is futile. One has to understand this. If you don’t understand it, you will always remain in illusion. Everything is futile and in life there is no progress, no improvement, because life is eternally there. Life is already perfect.\nAll that you try to do to make it more perfect is futile, but it takes time to realise it. Now you are feeling stuck. You can do two things. You can change your style of life and then for a few days again you will be on a honeymoon – hopes and desires and ambitions... and the possibility of tomorrow again becomes alive. But after a few days that tomorrow never comes. Again you are stuck and the whole thing again becomes routine.\nIt is just like when you love a woman. The honeymoon over, the love is over. By the end of the honeymoon you are again seeking and searching for another woman. But you can go on in this way from one honeymoon to another but it is not going to help in any way. You have to realise that there is nothing to achieve in life. Life is not goal-oriented. Life is eternally herenow. It is already perfect. It cannot be improved upon.\nOnce you realise this, then there is no future, no hope, no desire, and no ambition. You live this moment; you enjoy and delight in it.\nThe feeling of stuckness is coming because you still have ambition left in the mind. That ambition is creating the frustration that nothing is improving – but there is nothing to be improved! The trees are happy because they don’t try to improve. They don’t listen to any foolish sermons of Vincent Peale or others. They don’t bother at all about the future.\nLook at life. Everything is so delighted, right this moment. So be delighted. This time, don’t change and don’t create another illusion. If you are feeling stuck, feel stuck. But tell the mind, ‘Now I am not going to create another dream for you so that you are riding on the wind again for a few days. No more !’\nLive with this stuckness and try to understand why you feel it. You are feeling it because you are always keeping a goal ahead. You have to reach somewhere, you have to go somewhere. Where? Life is here – where are you going? There is nowhere to go.\nOnce you understand that, the stuckness will melt away. It is created by you, by your idea that one should be always growing, always growing. Where will you reach by always growing? Now you are mature enough to understand that life has no meaning in the future. The meaning is intrinsic, herenow, in the present.\nSo enjoy your food, enjoy the woman you love, enjoy your work, enjoy your sleep, and forget all about the future. Then the stuckness will melt by itself. Nothing is to be done. It is not a problem. The problem is deeper than your stuckness. The problem is that you are still hankering; the mind is greedy.\nOne day everybody has to come to that point and to realise, ‘What nonsense am I doing with my life? – wasting it in improving it while it is already perfect.’\nThat’s what I mean when I say that you are gods – nothing is to be done.\nDelight in the fact of your being. Enjoy the way you are and enjoy the world that’s available to you. Then each moment becomes a diamond in itself. Life is no more a means. Each moment is an end unto itself. That’s what Jesus means when he says ‘Think not of the morrow’.\nFor one month, live in the moment, and even if you feel that stuckness, let it remain there. Nothing is to be done. Tell it, ‘Okay, I accept you, but I am not going to do anything. I am going to live moment to moment.’ And enjoy yourself. For one month, without any goal, without the achieving mind constantly boiling within, without any desire, simply live. That’s what a religious man is.\n[The Hypnotherapy group is present. Osho has said about hypnotherapy:\n’Hypnotherapy touches the fourth body, the body of consciousness. It simply puts a suggestion into your mind – call it animal magnetism, mesmerism or whatsoever you like. It works through the power of thought, not the power of matter. If your consciousness accepts a certain idea, it starts functioning.\n‘Hypnotherapy has a great future. It is going to become the medicine of the future, because if just by changing your thoughtpattern your mind can be changed, through your mind the vital body, and through the vital body your gross body, then why bother with poisons and gross medicine? Why not work through thoughtpower?’\nA group member says: I went to the music group and I was dancing and I thought I was Shiva dancing with Devi and then I was Devi dancing with Shiva. Then I didn’t know if I was Shiva or Devi or... And is it my imagination?... Is it real?]\nYes, it is real. And it will get realer ! [much laughter] If there is some problem, Shiva will get worried about what happened to his Devi! Don’t you be worried. Enjoy it!\nNever analyse happiness. If you are feeling happy, feel happy so it grows. Once you start analysing it and thinking whether it is real or unreal, a mind game or imagination, this or that, then the whole thing is disturbed. What does it matter if it is real or unreal? If you are happy, you are happy. Happiness is real. You understand me?\nYou felt happy – that happiness is real. What does it matter whether Shiva was dancing with you or Devi was dancing with you or not? It is irrelevant, because happiness is real. If you analyse it there is every possibility that the happiness will disappear. Analysis is very antagonistic to happiness.\nSo when you are unhappy, analyse [laughter]. When you are happy, never analyse. Just accept it as a gift of God and enjoy it. Enjoy it more.\n[A sannyasin says: It seems difficult for me to live without problemsI don’t know what to do!]\nGo on creating! Create big problems! [much laughter]\n... If you get tired, you will drop it; you won’t create problems. You are not yet tired! [laughter] These groupleaders will tire you. These groups are only for this – to tire you! So when you are really tired [chuckling] and you don’t want to do any more groups, you will have to drop the problems. If you bring problems I will have to send you to a group !\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"5405","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_cypress_in_the_courtyard/part6/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_cypress_in_the_courtyard/>The Cypress in the Courtyard</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">6</h1><div class=post-meta>26 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;5405 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Cypress_in_the_Courtyard/part6.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part5>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |
<a href=part7>Next ></a></p><p><span id=bookmark5>‌</span>CHAPTER <span class=s3>6</span></p><p><br></p><p>9 June 1976 pm in Chuang Tzu Auditorium</p><p><br></p><p>Deva means divine and anuragi means lover – a lover of God.</p><p><br></p><p>And that is going to be your path. Love is going to be your path. It
is easy and yet it is difficult. Easy if you can allow yourself to
surrender. Difficult if the ego goes on resisting, showing defense. It
is in your hands.</p><p><br></p><p>And when I say that love is your path, I mean change every moment of
your life into a loving energy. If you are walking on a street, feel as
if you are full of love, diffusing love. Nobody is there; you are not
addressing your love to anybody in particular, just unaddressed... just
as a flower sends its fragrance unaddressed. The bees, the birds, the
stones, all need love. Every situation can be converted into a love
situation. If you are sitting in your room alone, fill the whole room
with love. Sometimes even touch things with a deep love, gratitude, as
if they are persons.</p><p><br></p><p>Ordinarily just the opposite is happening in the world: we touch
persons as if they are things. We should touch things as if they are
persons.</p><p><br></p><p>That will start a transformation in your energy. By and by, you will
see that you are riding on a great wave. It is the same energy that we
are diffusing unnecessarily, sometimes as anger, sometimes as jealousy,
sometimes as possessiveness, sometimes as anxiety. All these things,
negativities, are nothing but energy unused because we have not been
able to direct the energy to its fulfillment and to its destiny. It
needs some ways to release itself otherwise it will become too
heavy.</p><p><br></p><p>God goes on giving you infinite energy every moment and we don’t know
how to use it. That unused energy has somehow to get out of your system,
otherwise you will be dead. It has to move so that God can pour new
energy into you.</p><p>Once you start pouring your energy as love, anxiety disappears
automatically. It is not a problem. This word ‘anxiety’ is very good. It
comes from a latin root ‘augustus’ which means narrowness. When your
energy has no way to move or you have so much energy and the way is too
narrow so that the energy feels confined, hemmed in, tension is created.
Then you find some way or other – even if it is destructive – to throw
it somehow.</p><p><br></p><p>So to me, anger, hatred, anxiety, are not problems. They are there
because you have not yet enjoyed love. So forget all about them and just
move into love. Suddenly you will see that your anger is no more there.
Anxieties have disappeared because the whole energy is being used by
love, and love is never narrow. It is as big as God, as infinite as God,
and once you are in deep love you are divine. Love makes everybody
divine.</p><p><br></p><p>If you don’t love, you are not even human: If you love, you are
divine.</p><p><br></p><p>So this has to be your path and the name Anuragi will remind you
continuously. [The new sannyasin says he is a law librarian.]</p><p>Very good. So treat books as persons. They are, mm?</p><p><br></p><p>[Osho suggested groups that he should do, first Tathata – the total
acceptance group<span class=s4></span>]</p><p><br></p><p>Total acceptance is the very base of love. Rejection creates hatred
and acceptability creates love. When you love somebody, you accept them
totally and unconditionally. You don’t want them to become somebody
else. You love them as they are. You delight in the way the other is.
You don’t have a ‘should’. You don’t try to improve. And when you love
yourself, then also you stop improving upon yourself because all
improvement shows a deep rejection.</p><p><br></p><p>So I don’t teach improvement. I teach transformation.</p><p><br></p><p>Anand means bliss and smaran means remembering, remembrance. It means
a constant remembrance; what Sufis call ‘zikr’ – a constant remembrance
of being blissful. Don’t forget it. Nothing else is needed, just a
remembrance that one is blissful. One is blissful, only one has
forgotten it. Only the language has to be reclaimed.</p><p><br></p><p>Bliss is not something to be achieved. It is already there, because
you have never been away from it. One cannot be away from it because
bliss is one’s nature. It is the deepest core of one’s being, so one can
forget. It is very easy to forget because it has always been there; so
much so that one tends to forget it.</p><p><br></p><p>It is just like a fish in the ocean. The fish cannot feel or know the
ocean because it has always been in it. Once it has been thrown on the
bank, for the first time it comes to know the ocean. When we are
separated from something, we come to know it; that is the problem.</p><p><br></p><p>We are never separate from our nature... we are never separate from
God. That’s why, how, we have forgotten all about God and we go on
asking, ‘Where is God?’ And you are God. The seeker is the sought.</p><p>This name I give to you to continuously remember. Walking, sitting,
eating, talking, alone or together, always remember again and again, ‘I
am blissfuL’ Let it become a chanting inside – ‘I am blissful.’ Let it
move in with the breath and out with the breath – ‘I am blissful’ – so
that it becomes almost like breathing. By and by, something will explode
within you and there will be no need to remember. You will know.</p><p><br></p><p>Remembrance is needed just to clear the way for knowing. Once you
know, there is no need to remember. This constant remembering is just
like a hammer. So keep this in the memory...</p><p><br></p><p>[The new sannyasin says: I’m having a hard time loving myself. I’m
always putting myself down. It’s something that I’ve just learned to
do.]</p><p><br></p><p>That’s a very significant insight – to know that one does not love
oneself, to know that it is very hard to love oneself.</p><p><br></p><p>This is not only the case with you. This is the case with the whole
humankind; the whole of humanity suffers from it. We never think about
it. We always think in terms of loving somebody else. The man thinks to
love the woman, the woman thinks to love the man; the mother thinks to
love the child, the child thinks to love the mother; friends think to
love each other. But unless you love yourself it is impossible to love
anybody else, because the very thing will be missing.</p><p><br></p><p>You can love somebody else only when you have love within you. You
can share something only when you have it.</p><p><br></p><p>But the whole humanity has lived under this wrong ideology, so we
take it for granted – as if we love ourselves and now the whole question
is of how to love the neighbour. It is impossible! That’s why there is
so much talk about love and the world remains ugly and full of hatred,
war and violence and anger.</p><p><br></p><p>This is a great insight to come to – that you don’t love yourself. It
is really hard to love oneself because we have been taught to condemn
ourselves and not to love. We have been taught that we are sinners. We
have been taught that we are not of any worth. Because of that it has
become difficult to love. How can you love a worthless person? How can
you love somebody who is already condemned?</p><p><br></p><p>But it will come. If this insight has come, there is nothing to be
worried about. One window has opened. You will not be inside the room
for long – you will jump out. Once you know the open sky, you cannot
remain confined in a stale world. You will come out of it.</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin said that she had been doing something which was like
Yoga but not as structured or as formal. She simply allowed her body to
move and take postures that it felt good in.</p><p><br></p><p>Osho said this exercise was good and could be very helpful.]</p><p><br></p><p>That is not what is ordinarily called Yoga, but there is a very
esoteric tradition in India which they call Sahaj Yoga – spontaneous
Yoga. There is no need to follow any form, any rigid discipline, but
just allow the body to have its way. The body knows more than the mind,
so if you fix some pattern and</p><p>try to force it on the body. it is the mind dominating the body and
the mind does not know as much as the body does.</p><p><br></p><p>The mind is a very late arrival. The body has existed for almost
three million years and the mind has not existed for more than
twenty-five thousand years a very late arrival. If we divide the whole
of history into twenty-four hours, the mind came only two minutes ago.
So the mind is very immature, childish. To try any discipline through
the mind on the body is putting things topsy-turvy.</p><p><br></p><p>I’m perfectly in favour of spontaneous postures. Allow the body to
have its own way. Listen to the body and what it says. The needs differ
from moment to moment. Today the need is something different and
tomorrow one never knows. Today the body may like to move in a certain
posture and tomorrow it may not like it; the need may not be there. But
if you are trying to enforce something from the mind, you go on
enforcing it without listening to the body. Then the whole thing becomes
formal, and a mind-trip.</p><p><br></p><p>So, good... but one thing I would like to add to whatsoever you are
doing is to remember that the mind is very tricky. What you call your
feelings may again just be a mind thing. It may not really be of the
body, because thought is of the mind and feeling is also. The mind has
become so predominant. It monopolises; it doesn’t allow anything. Even
if you feel, you feel through the mind. As in this, the mind interprets
everything.</p><p><br></p><p>Have you heard anything about Subud? It will be very helpful for you.
What Subud people call Latihan will be exactly the thing for you. So
after the camp I will tell you how to move into Latihan.</p><p><br></p><p>You don’t need to do anything with the mind. Simply stand in a loose
posture and wait for God, for the whole, to work in you. Then you do
whatsoever you want to do in a deeply prayerful mood – ‘I am at Thy
will’ – and just relax.</p><p><br></p><p>It is just like when people do automatic handwriting. They just keep
the pen in their hand and wait. Suddenly some energy possesses the hand
and the hand starts moving. They are surprised – their own hand is
moving and they are not moving it! Wait exactly like that, and after
three, four minutes, suddenly you will see a few jerks coming to the
body and energy descending in vou. Don’t get scared because It Is very
scarey You are not dolng It. In tact you are just a witness; it is
happening.</p><p><br></p><p>Move with it. The body will start taking many postures – moving,
dancing, swaying, trembling, shaking; many things will happen. Go on
allowing; not only allowing but cooperating. Then you will come exactly
to what we call Sahaj Yoga.</p><p><br></p><p>Latihan is nothing new. The word is new. Subud is not something new.
It is just a new version of Sahaj Yoga – spontaneous Yoga. You leave
everything to the divine, because the mind is tricky. Soon you will see
the difference because you will just be a watcher. You will be surprised
because your hand will be moving and you are not moving it at all. After
a few days of relaxing into it, even if you want to stop, suddenly you
will not be able to; you will see that you are possessed. So one has to
pray in the beginning and say, ‘For twenty minutes take possession of my
being and do whatsoever you want to do: Thy will be done; Thy kingdom
come.’ Let that attitude be there and just relax. God will start dancing
in you and will take many postures. The body needs will be fulfilled,
but not only that – something higher- than the body, greater than the
body, some deep needs of consciousness will be fulfilled.</p><p>I can see that you have been seeking and searching. You don’t know
exactly what you are seeking but nobody knows unless one finds. One goes
on groping in the dark.</p><p><br></p><p>Much is going to happen. First do the camp as totally as
possible.</p><p><br></p><p>[An elderly sannyasin says: I have quite spontaneous experiences and
sometimes they happen slowly, but also sometimes they are quite
ferocious, quite violent.]</p><p><br></p><p>Sometimes they can be, but everything is alright. God is both
beautiful and ferocious, mysterious and terrible. He has to be because
He is all. He is the day and the night, summer and winter. He is life
and He is death, so all contradictions are doing in Him.</p><p><br></p><p>Sometimes experiences can be very very ferocious. Enjoy that too.
That is going to help.</p><p><br></p><p>... You have to let it go. Whatsoever the experience, you are not to
create any resistance; you have simply to go into it. Even if it is
ferocious, move into it and suddenly you will see the beauty of it. The
ferocious is also beautiful once you allow it.</p><p><br></p><p>It is just like a cyclone in the ocean – ferocious, dangerous – but
once you know that that too belongs to God, you are on the shore. You
can enjoy it... it is beautiful. The very wildness gives it a certain
depth.</p><p><br></p><p>So both are beautiful. Simply relax and enjoy. Your experiences are
going very very well and in the right direction. Much more is going to
happen... but you are resisting a little. You are a little afraid. That
fear has to be dropped. In these few weeks that you are here, we will
try so you can drop the fear. Even if sometimes you feel that it is
almost maddening, don’t be afraid.</p><p><br></p><p>It happens because of our capacity. Our capacity is small and
sometimes God pours so much into us that it is maddening. It is almost
two hundred volts in a one-hundred-voltage wire, so everything goes
crazy.</p><p><br></p><p>Allow it, because that is the only way to increase your capacity. It
will happen many times, because more experiences will be coming. The
more ready you become, the more will be coming, and there is no end to
it.</p><p><br></p><p>In God there is only the beginning of the journey. There is no end to
it.</p><p><br></p><p>He goes on becoming more and more wild, the more you allow. But it is
tremendously beautiful. Once you can enjoy it, you are simply grateful.
You should be grateful.</p><p><br></p><p>[A young woman says she has always been afraid of the dark... afraid
to sleep on her own in a room.]</p><p><br></p><p>Do a few groups here... things will change.</p><p><br></p><p>It is just through wrong associations from childhood. Many children
have them because parents are not alert, so children suffer for the
whole of their life. Sometimes parents even make them afraid of</p><p>the dark. They use it as a technique, a device to make the child
afraid, because when the child is afraid he can be controlled. But it
can create deep problems inside.</p><p><br></p><p>Darkness is one of the most beautiful things in the world, so you are
missing a lot. And to be alone has such beauty. That too you are
missing, because if you are afraid of darkness, you will be afraid of
aloneness. Darkness is very silent. It has nothing in it to create fear
in you. It is just through an association from childhood. Aloneness is
very very pure. The greatest experience of life happens in aloneness and
in darkness.</p><p><br></p><p>So this fear has to be dropped. We will find ways how to drop it,
because you are missing much. Because of the fear you will not be able
to love, because these are associated problems. If there is too much
fear, the whole of your energy becomes concerned with fear. And love is
the opposite of fear. So if fear is there, you will not be able to love.
Once fears disappear you will be able to love. ... it will go don’t be
worried.</p><p><br></p><p>[Osho gives her sannyas.]</p><p><br></p><p>Now I will protect you. Don’t be afraid of any darkness or anything.
This will be your new name: Ma Prem Chidambara.</p><p>Prem means love, because when fear goes, love will appear. Once fear
is dropped, the same energy that is involved in fear will be released in
love. Prem means love.</p><p><br></p><p>And Chidambara is one of the most beautiful names in India. It means
sky of consciousness, expansion of consciousness. So get in tune with
this new name. It will mean the sky of love and consciousness. That is
the goal of the whole of humanity and they both come together.</p><p><br></p><p>When you love, you become more conscious. If you become more
conscious, you love more. Love is the only religion, but it appears only
when fear is completely dropped.</p><p><br></p><p>But it will go. I can see that there is no trouble. And change to
orange !</p><p><br></p><p>[A middle-aged visitor explained that she works for a dutch airline
and while she doesn’t particularly enjoy it, she needs the money. She
said she had trouble communicating with young people.]</p><p><br></p><p>So I can make you younger! That will be easier. Don’t leave, because
you will have to earn money and you have only five more years to go. I
will make you a little younger and you will be able to relate. It is
just some attitude that is creating the trouble, not the job.</p><p><br></p><p>Always remember that whenever there is a gap, it is the older
person’s responsibility to bridge it because you are more mature and
more understanding. Young people are too young. They don’t know anything
about life yet, so if they don’t create any bridge, it can be forgiven.
But you can create a bridge more easily. But it will happen.</p><p><br></p><p>You can do a few groups here. My young people will pull you back.</p><p><br></p><p>[She answers: I have no difficulty with young people if they are not
narrow-minded.]</p><p>That is difficult. How can one change them? We can only change you.
You are here, so something can be done.</p><p><br></p><p>Whether they are narrow-minded or not, that is their problem. It
should not create a problem for you. That is their problem and they will
suffer for it. Why should you be worried?</p><p><br></p><p>So do a few groups here. Only in a Group will you be able to see how
you are creating your problem.</p><p><br></p><p>By leaving your job you will create problems. You will always feel
that you have not taken the right decision if you leave. It will be like
an escape because you could not cope with it and you will never be able
to forgive yourself. It will linger in your mind continuously. If you
want to leave the job, you can, but first settle this problem.</p><p><br></p><p>Once there is no problem and you want to leave, leave, but to leave
because of the problem is not good. My suggestion is always that if you
want to leave a certain thing, be successful in it and then leave it,
but never leave it as a failure.</p><p><br></p><p>When you are winning, leave. But when you are feeling that you are
defeated, stick to it. Wait for the right moment – when you are winning
– and then leave. Then you will come out of it cleanly.</p><p><br></p><p>[Osho gives her sannyas.]</p><p><br></p><p>Deva means divine and Vibhuti means gift – God’s gift. Look at
yourself in that way. Our life is a gift, a tremendously valuable gift.
We may realise it, we may not, but it is an infinite gift.</p><p><br></p><p>So think in terms of life being a gift from God and then you will
take more care of your life. You start loving your life. Then you don’t
waste it. It is precious... each moment is tremendously precious, and
once it is gone it is not going to come back.</p><p><br></p><p>[A visitor says: My husband divorced me two years ago and my children
are grown up and have left home.]</p><p><br></p><p>Mm! So this is an opportunity! Don’t take it wrongly. If you are left
alone you can grow. Many people are suffering because the husband has
not left yet [laughter].</p><p><br></p><p>So feel happy. This is a great opportunity to use. People say to me,
‘What can we do – so many children and the husband.<span class=s4></span>’ They have to devote their lives to them. You are
simply alone. So don’t</p><p>take it wrongly.</p><p><br></p><p>[She adds: But there are difficulties for my children. I feel very
sorry for them.]</p><p><br></p><p>One should be sorry for oneself, because we cannot do anything else.
All that you can do is about you. You will be gone soon but the children
will be here<span class=s4></span>And nobody can manage anybody
else’s</p><p>life.</p><p><br></p><p>’<span class=s4></span>though they are with you,</p><p><br></p><p>yet they belong not to you.</p><p>You may give them your love but not your thoughts,</p><p>for they have their own thoughts.</p><p><br></p><p>You may house their bodies but not their souls, for their souls dwell
in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit even in your
dreams.’</p><p>God will take care. It is none of our business to be too concerned.
Whatsoever we can do, we do, but one should not hanker about things
going the way one wants. That is very egoistic. You have given birth to
a child, but once he is out of the womb, he is free of you.</p><p><br></p><p>First he depended for his breath on you when he was in the womb. Then
he will take his own breath. You don’t say. ‘What are you doing? Are you
trying to be free of me? Trying to be independent?’ You feel happy that
your child is breathing.</p><p><br></p><p>First he will take milk from you, then one day he will start eating
on his own. First he will go on clinging to your apron and then one day
he will leave it.</p><p><br></p><p>You will be happy because the child is growing, becoming mature. Then
finally one day he falls in love with a woman. He has found his woman,
so he will go on his own way. Bless them, and whatsoever happens, they
have to find their own life and their own meaning to life.</p><p><br></p><p>Now you are free. Just try to find your meaning, your life, your
goals, and devote the few days that are left to the search of the
ultimate. Don’t be concerned with ordinary things.</p><p><br></p><p>I have never seen a single parent who is happy about their children.
I have heard a jewish joke.…</p><p><br></p><p>A jewish woman died and the first thing she asked when she got to
heaven was if she could see Mary. So it was arranged She went to see
Mary and she said, ‘I have only one question to ask. You must be the
happiest woman in the world. Your son is worshipped by millions.’</p><p><br></p><p>Mary said ‘What! I always wanted him to become a doctor!’
[laughter]</p><p><br></p><p>Nobody is ever happy. Even the father of Buddha was not happy. He was
very very annoyed because his son turned out to be a beggar. He became a
sannyasin and the father was hoping he would become an emperor. He
crushed all his father’s hopes.</p><p><br></p><p>Whatsoever happens to the children – good or bad; even if they become
saints – it doesn’t matter. One thing is certain – that the child is not
here to fulfill your expectations. That much is certain. The child is
here with his own destiny, and he will unfold his own destiny. You are
trying somehow to direct his destiny and that is going to be
frustrated.</p><p>So if the child becomes a thief or a murderer, of course the parents
feel bad, and it looks logical. But even if he becomes a Jesus or a
Buddha, then too they feel frustrated because they have their own ideas
and the children try to do their own thing.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t be concerned; it is okay. Accept it and bless them. They have
to find their own ways. Who are we to interfere? And how can we? Pray
for them but leave them on their own. You try to grow yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is my feeling: if you change, much will change. Even in your
relationship with your children, much will change. When you change, the
relationship cannot be the same. There is a possibility that they will
look at you again with a different view, with different eyes. But you
change. It is irrelevant what they do.</p><p><br></p><p>For one month just be here with me and allow me to work a little. If
you are preoccupied with the children and your problems there, you will
not be here. Forget all about Holland. It doesn’t exist for one month.
Meditate, enjoy, celebrate and be happy for this one month.</p><p><br></p><p>[The ashram Rolfer says: I’ve been here for over a year now and a lot
of things have happened to me and yet now I feel that I’m back in an old
space where everything just seems futile... ]</p><p><br></p><p>Everything is futile. One has to understand this. If you don’t
understand it, you will always remain in illusion. Everything is futile
and in life there is no progress, no improvement, because life is
eternally there. Life is already perfect.</p><p><br></p><p>All that you try to do to make it more perfect is futile, but it
takes time to realise it. Now you are feeling stuck. You can do two
things. You can change your style of life and then for a few days again
you will be on a honeymoon – hopes and desires and ambitions... and the
possibility of tomorrow again becomes alive. But after a few days that
tomorrow never comes. Again you are stuck and the whole thing again
becomes routine.</p><p><br></p><p>It is just like when you love a woman. The honeymoon over, the love
is over. By the end of the honeymoon you are again seeking and searching
for another woman. But you can go on in this way from one honeymoon to
another but it is not going to help in any way. You have to realise that
there is nothing to achieve in life. Life is not goal-oriented. Life is
eternally herenow. It is already perfect. It cannot be improved
upon.</p><p><br></p><p>Once you realise this, then there is no future, no hope, no desire,
and no ambition. You live this moment; you enjoy and delight in it.</p><p><br></p><p>The feeling of stuckness is coming because you still have ambition
left in the mind. That ambition is creating the frustration that nothing
is improving – but there is nothing to be improved! The trees are happy
because they don’t try to improve. They don’t listen to any foolish
sermons of Vincent Peale or others. They don’t bother at all about the
future.</p><p><br></p><p>Look at life. Everything is so delighted, right this moment. So be
delighted. This time, don’t change and don’t create another illusion. If
you are feeling stuck, feel stuck. But tell the mind, ‘Now I am not
going to create another dream for you so that you are riding on the wind
again for a few days. No more !’</p><p>Live with this stuckness and try to understand why you feel it. You
are feeling it because you are always keeping a goal ahead. You have to
reach somewhere, you have to go somewhere. Where? Life is here – where
are you going? There is nowhere to go.</p><p><br></p><p>Once you understand that, the stuckness will melt away. It is created
by you, by your idea that one should be always growing, always growing.
Where will you reach by always growing? Now you are mature enough to
understand that life has no meaning in the future. The meaning is
intrinsic, herenow, in the present.</p><p><br></p><p>So enjoy your food, enjoy the woman you love, enjoy your work, enjoy
your sleep, and forget all about the future. Then the stuckness will
melt by itself. Nothing is to be done. It is not a problem. The problem
is deeper than your stuckness. The problem is that you are still
hankering; the mind is greedy.</p><p><br></p><p>One day everybody has to come to that point and to realise, ‘What
nonsense am I doing with my life? – wasting it in improving it while it
is already perfect.’</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what I mean when I say that you are gods – nothing is to be
done.</p><p><br></p><p>Delight in the fact of your being. Enjoy the way you are and enjoy
the world that’s available to you. Then each moment becomes a diamond in
itself. Life is no more a means. Each moment is an end unto itself.
That’s what Jesus means when he says ‘Think not of the morrow’.</p><p><br></p><p>For one month, live in the moment, and even if you feel that
stuckness, let it remain there. Nothing is to be done. Tell it, ‘Okay, I
accept you, but I am not going to do anything. I am going to live moment
to moment.’ And enjoy yourself. For one month, without any goal, without
the achieving mind constantly boiling within, without any desire, simply
live. That’s what a religious man is.</p><p><br></p><p>[The Hypnotherapy group is present. Osho has said about
hypnotherapy:</p><p><br></p><p>’Hypnotherapy touches the fourth body, the body of consciousness. It
simply puts a suggestion into your mind – call it animal magnetism,
mesmerism or whatsoever you like. It works through the power of thought,
not the power of matter. If your consciousness accepts a certain idea,
it starts functioning.</p><p><br></p><p>‘Hypnotherapy has a great future. It is going to become the medicine
of the future, because if just by changing your thoughtpattern your mind
can be changed, through your mind the vital body, and through the vital
body your gross body, then why bother with poisons and gross medicine?
Why not work through thoughtpower?’</p><p><br></p><p>A group member says: I went to the music group and I was dancing and
I thought I was Shiva dancing with Devi and then I was Devi dancing with
Shiva. Then I didn’t know if I was Shiva or Devi or... And is it my
imagination?... Is it real?]</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, it is real. And it will get realer ! [much laughter] If there is
some problem, Shiva will get worried about what happened to his Devi!
Don’t you be worried. Enjoy it!</p><p>Never analyse happiness. If you are feeling happy, feel happy so it
grows. Once you start analysing it and thinking whether it is real or
unreal, a mind game or imagination, this or that, then the whole thing
is disturbed. What does it matter if it is real or unreal? If you are
happy, you are happy. Happiness is real. You understand me?</p><p><br></p><p>You felt happy – that happiness is real. What does it matter whether
Shiva was dancing with you or Devi was dancing with you or not? It is
irrelevant, because happiness is real. If you analyse it there is every
possibility that the happiness will disappear. Analysis is very
antagonistic to happiness.</p><p><br></p><p>So when you are unhappy, analyse [laughter]. When you are happy,
never analyse. Just accept it as a gift of God and enjoy it. Enjoy it
more.</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin says: It seems difficult for me to live without
problems<span class=s4></span>I don’t know what to do!]</p><p><br></p><p>Go on creating! Create big problems! [much laughter]</p><p><br></p><p>... If you get tired, you will drop it; you won’t create problems.
You are not yet tired! [laughter] These groupleaders will tire you.
These groups are only for this – to tire you! So when you are really
tired [chuckling] and you don’t want to do any more groups, you will
have to drop the problems. If you bring problems I will have to send you
to a group !</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part5>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

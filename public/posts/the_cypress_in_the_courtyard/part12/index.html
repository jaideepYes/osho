For each person something suits, but something else does not. Sometimes the method that suits somebody may be very destructive to somebody else. A method is like medicine. It may suit somebody, may be of tremendous benefit, and to somebody else it may become poison.\nJust a few years before, physicians used to think that the medicine relates to the disease and not to the person. Now they have changed that idea. Two persons may be suffering from the same disease... and still the medicine may not work. So now they say, ’Don’t treat the disease, treat the person. Two persons suffering from the same disease... it looks logical that the same medicine may work. But the disease is a small part and the whole gestalt of the person is very big.\nSo the disease is different – maybe the symptoms are the same, but two persons cannot suffer from the same disease because two persons are not the same. As our fingerprints are different, exactly like that everything else is different and unique, individual. So each individual has to be regarded as an individual and cared for individually.\nThe West is too technology-oriented. Technology does not bother about individuals. It does not believe in individuals; it believes in the technique. So the technique becomes very important, and in reality the individual is supreme.\nSo, many times it will happen that something does not suit you; so then don’t try to fit with it. It can be destructive. Listen to your heart. If it does not fit with you, then it is not for you – whatsoever the authorities say.\nThe authorities have their own vested interests in it. They try to make you feel guilty that something is wrong with you. They throw the whole responsibility on you and save the technique. They say the technique is perfect; you are defective. The technique is perfect; you are not okay. The technique is perfect; you are not allowing it to work. Then one starts feeling guilty, as if one is not dOing the right thing.\nSo never feel guilty. Let that be my message for your sannyas day: never feel guilty and never think in terms of your being made for some technique, some method or means. No man is made for anything and everything is made for man.\nSo the ultimate decision has to come from your innermost core. If it suits, then go headlong. If it doesn’t suit, then watch. Whatsoever others are saying, don’t be bothered. It may be suiting them. There is no need to contradict them, no need to distract them, no need to convert them to your own way. Simply remember that it may be suitable for them; it is not suitable for you. And forget all about it.\nNow so many techniques are about and people are moving from one technique to another, doing this and that. Much confusion is going to be created out of it. People will be left without roots. One technique you uproot, with another technique you uproot something else. Unless something suits, it will not get roots. Now this is a trend that even when a technique suits, then too people go on looking for sensation, for some thrill – maybe something more can happen somewhere else.\nThis vagrant mind, this mind of the wanderer, is not good, because a tree has to remain in one spot lo get more deeply rooted. A person should do many things before selecting a spot for himself. But once you see that something is fitting, then forget all about what others are saying, what others are doing. Move into it, otherwise there will be no time left for finding roots.\n[The sannyasin adds: I go on and on about my path, wondering which is the right one. I feel it is meditation and yet I wish it were love.]\nNo, don’t worry, and don’t wish against it. Love will come. There is no need to be concerned about it.\nWhen I say love will come, I don’t mean that you have become unloving or that you don’t love people. You love people, you are loving, but you are not following love as the path to the divine. Human love is perfectly okay. It is good, it is helpful, but technically you are not moving towards God through love. You enjoy love, you share love. That’s perfectly good. That has nothing to do with God. That’s your delight.\nBut technically you are moving on the path of meditation. Soon you will see more and more love arising. Go on loving People, dispersing love, sharing your life, your being, with others, but always remember that is not the path for you to be on. That may be your expression of meditation but not the means to the goal.\nWhen meditation is going well, suddenly love will bloom forth like flowers in the spring. So you need not think about it, and don’t create any anxiety about it. It is not a question of our wishing, because wishes are very deceptive. The question is of feeling, not of wishing. If you feel that meditation helps\nyou – you become more quiet, more calm, collected – then that is your path. Love is not negated. It is not chosen as the path, that is all.\nLove will follow like a shadow.\nDeva means divine and amitabh means infinite light – infinite divine light. Amitabh is also a name of Buddha, because of his infinite light. In Japan, Amitabh has become Amida. They call Buddha ‘Amida’, but it is a form of Amitabh.\n[The new sannyasin says: And all my life I’ve felt like my path was the path of love, and yet I get so much from the meditations. I’m not really struggling with the two, but I heard you say about one path or the other... ]\nNo, no need to struggle. And no problems are ever solved. People who are trying to solve them are moving in a false direction. They may find some solutions but those solutions will be homemade because problems are existential and solutions will be mind-products. So for a few days you can concern yourself with the solution, but sooner or later they wear out and the problems reassert themselves again, or the solutions will give birth to more problems. Every solution creates more problems than it solves.\nThe right path is to grow out of them, to grow beyond them, to transcend them. Problems can never be solved, but they can be dissolved. My whole effort here is to dissolve them, not to solve them.\nA moment of pure consciousness comes where no problem exists – and no solution. You are settled there with no problem to solve, and no solution to carry and to remember. Everything has simply fallen, withered away. This state is what satori is.\nSo the whole effort here is not to solve anybody’s problems. We are not working philosophically. We are working existentially.\nExistence knows no problems. Problems are man-created. In fact, problems are because we are tense. It is not the other way around – that we are tense because there are problems, no. Because we are tense, there are problems. So once the tension is relaxed the problems disappear.\nPeople ordinarily think that there are problems and that’s why we are so anxious and worried. Not so. You are worried, anxious, so you cannot live without problems. You create them. Your worry needs some problems to hang on. So if one problem is solved, immediately you create another.\nJust solving problems is not going to help. It will be a sheer wastage. So I try to cut the very root, the grass-root – and that is the state of a tense mind. Once that state relaxes, all problems simply disappear as dewdrops disappear in the morning.\nOnce you have known that moment – even for a single time – you have the key in your hand, and whenever you want to you can open the door of the temple and enter. If you want to enjoy a little worry and problems, that’s up to you ! But now it is not a problem really, it is a game. If you want to sharpen your mind against anxieties, do it. But then you know that it is a game and you enjoy it.\nIn fact, anxiety is not anxiety then. It is as if you are solving a crossword puzzle. It creates anxiety but that’s just a game. Or you are playing cards or chess. You know that the whole thing is created by you. Don’t play the game – get out of it! Nobody is forcing you to play it. You enter it on your own initiative, voluntarily, because you enjoy that sharpening, that state of tense consciousness. There is nothing wrong in it.\nBut then the whole life is nothing but a chessboard and any moment you want to get out of it you can throw the board and finish the game. You have the key and you can move. Then problems are like toys and you play with them. So that is exactly the point to be understood.\nWhen you move into deep meditation everything becomes tremendous, because so much energy is released – the same energy that is getting caught in many nets and knots, anxieties, problems, tensions, worries, depressions, sadness, this and that; so many knots around you.\nI have heard one joke.…\nVisitor: What happened to the fellow in this cell? Attendant: He went crazy trying to untie a knot in a string. Visitor: What is this other fellow’s trouble?\nAttendant: He went nuts trying to help the other fellow untie the knot. Visitor: And who is the raving maniac in the padded cell?\nAttendant: He’s the guy that tied the knot.\nThrough the whole of life we go on making many knots around us, unknowingly, unconsciously. The way we live is so unalert that those knots are created automatically. Then we try to solve them. Then we get caught and the whole energy becomes diversified, divided and blocked everywhere.\nSo when you start meditating, you start becoming loose from your preoccupations, and the energy that was involved in it falls back on you... a tremendous upsurge – unbelievable. Then everything becomes tremendous. If you are angry, you are tremendously angry, or if you are loving, you are tremendously loving. If you are sad, you are tremendously sad. If you are happy, you are tremendously happy. This is the first step into meditation.\nBy and by, you start seeing that when with the same energy you can be tremendously happy, then why be tremendously sad? It is the same energy, and it is so easy to change it from sadness to happiness, from anger to compassion, from violence to love. It is so easy just as if you are putting the light on and off. But if you don’t know the button, it looks difficult.\nA friend of Sigmund Freud, who was a poor man but had been childhood friends with Freud, came to visit him from his village. He had never seen electricity and it was for the first time that he saw it in Freud’s house. Just so as not to look ignorant, he didn’t ask what it was.\nIn the night when he was left in his bedroom, he tried hard to figure out how to put it off. If you have never seen electricity, it is almost impossible for you to conceive that somewhere just behind the door there is a knob which yon just have to push and the electricity will be off. He had known only lamps, kerosene lamps and other things, so he stood on a chair and studied the light but it seemed impossible to extinguish it.\nHe tried the whole night but he couldn’t put off the light. In the morning Freud asked, ‘You slept well?’\nThe man said, ‘Everything was okay but I couldn’t sleep because of this light. Tell me – it’s miraculous – how do you put it off?’\nFreud said, ‘Why didn’t you ask me?!’ And the man said, ‘I am just foolish and I didn’t want to look ignorant, so I tried to find a way but I couldn’t.’\nSo if you don’t know, it is very difficult to think that the same energy can become anger, and the same energy can become love. The same energies can move the fan, can give you light, can run your car, can do a thousand and one things, on the surface completely unrelated to each other. What is the relationship between a fan and a lightbulb? On the surface there is no relationship, but deep down it is the same current.\nSo the second step will be to look deeply and see that it is the same energy. Then it is foolish to waste it in anger and sadness. Why not be happy? A moment comes when one is simply happy. Not that one becomes happy; one is simply happy... happiness becomes one’s climate. In fact one completely forgets that one is happy. Then only is one happy. Happiness is then so engrained, so natural, so spontaneous, just like breathing.\nIf there is some trouble you become aware of your breathing; otherwise there is no need. It goes on functioning so smoothly. It is just like when you have a headache then you remember your head, but otherwise why? If your body is perfectly healthy you forget the body. Only an ill person knows that he has a body. A healthy person forgets. He becomes bodiless.\nIn indian medicine, health is defined as the feeling of bodilessness. I have never come across a better definition. Western medicine defines health as an absence of illness. That is not a true definition. If you have to bring in illness to define health it is a very negative definition. Absence of illness is not much of a health because there is no positive element in it.\nIt is possible that a man may not have any illness and may not be healthy either, because health has a positive well-being in it. The indian definition seems to be very refined: the feeling of bodilessness. When the shoe fits, one forgets the feet. When the shoe is not fitting, then you remember it. When the body fits completely, you forget all about it. Then you are a nobody.\nTo be a somebody is to be ill. The very feeling that ‘I am somebody’ is ill. To be nobody is perfectly healthy.\nAnd much is going to happen... leave everything to me. Now I will be responsible. You can be absolutely irresponsible.\n[To a visitor from Israel who was unable to stay much longer, Osho suggested he do meditation regularly, saying that dancing, particularly would be helpful for him... ]\nYou can create a small group of friends who can dance together. That will be better, more helpful. Man is so weak that alone it is difficult to continue anything. Hence, schools are needed. So if you are not feeling like doing it one day and others are, their energy moves you. Someday somebody else is not feeling like it but you are, so your energy comes through.\nLeft alone, man is very weak and willless. One day you do it and another day you feel that you are tired and have other things to do. Meditations bring results only when they are done in a persistent way. Then it sinks inside you.\nIt is just as if you are digging a hole in the earth. One day you dig in one place, another day in another place. Then you can go on digging for the whole of your life but the well will never be ready. You have to dig in the same place continuously.\nSo make it a point, at the same time every day. And if in the same place it is possible, very good; the same room, the same atmosphere, burn the same incense... so the body by and by learns and the mind by and by gets the feel of it. The moment you enter the room you are ready to dance. The room is charged, the time is charged.\nThat’s how temples, churches, synagogues came to exist in the world. In the beginning they were beautiful places. People came again and again to the same place, to the same atmosphere. Once they entered the synagogue or the temple, they entered a different world from their ordinary world. That very feeling helps to change the mood.\nSo if you can find a place where you can go every day, every night or morning, do it, mm?\n[A sannyasin reports back to Osho after being advised to accept his mind (see ‘Beloved of my Heart’ May 10th.):\nI feel more conscious of what I’m doing... but I’d like to be able to do what I’m doing, rather than thinking all the time what I’m going to do next.]\nEverybody is trying to improve and to become somebody – and that’s absurd. Nobody ever becomes anybody. Everybody remains himself or herself, so the whole effort is a wastage. It is good for you to accept yourself, but I still think something is lurking in the mind. Just accept and don’t create any tension.\nI want you to be completely rid of your guilt feelings so that the division is no more there. You are two [of you]. One is trying to manipulate the other; the top dog continuously trying to manipulate the bottom dog. The bottom dog is also very cunning; he has to be. He goes on saying, ‘Yes sir, yes sir,’ but he goes on doing his own thing.\nDrop this division. Whatsoever happens is good. Don’t judge. Just remain with whatsoever is. There is no other way for it to be. It is very difficult because it is against the ego. The ego says, ‘Something better is possible. Something more is possible. I can do this and that, and I can become somebody.’\nThe ego does not feel good with deep acceptance. In fact deep acceptance will become a death to the ego. The ego thrives on conflict.\nSo just float. You are looking better. You have not looked so good for many months . . . relaxed. If you feel like doing something, do it but don’t make it a drive. When you have completely relaxed and there is no guilt, then I will tell you to do many things. But first this guilt has to go. If it remains it will again jump and will possess you again.\nSo there is nothing to do right now – simply float. When you feel like meditating, meditate, otherwise simply be.\n[A sannyasin said:... a thought came into my head that only God is important. And then somehow the word ‘important’ dropped and I had to say ‘God is only’.\nHe goes on to ask about dropping his attachment to his mother who has passed over.]\nGood... very good. Good things are happening. Nothing is important, and when nothing is important, that which is left is important – call it God. Better not to give it any name because once we give it a name we start having some idea, some definition, some limitation. No need to give it a name.. This much is enough: nothing is important.\nAnd if one can remember that nothing is important, one becomes detached spontaneously, by and by. No need to practise detachment. Just in the very realisation that nothing is important, one becomes detached. That detachment is beautiful.\nIf you practise detachment it is ugly, because deep down the attachment continues. You go on fighting with it and you create the opposite but the conflict continues. And wherever there is conflict there is ugliness. And wherever there is no conflict there is beauty. Beauty is energy moving into deep harmony without any conflict.\nNothing is important, but when you repeat this, remember that nothing is unimportant either. Unimportance is a byproduct. If something is important, only then is something unimportant. Nothing is important because nothing is unimportant. Things simply are. If we are attached to them we call them important. If we are not attached to them we call them unimportant.\nImportance and unimportance come because of our attachment. Once the attachment is not there, things simply are – unlabelled, unclassified. They don’t belong to any category: important, unimportant, valuable, not valuable, profane, sacred. The world is simply there then in its total nakedness and its total beauty.\nSheer purity is there... one is surrounded by innocence. It has been good. Continue to remember it.\n[A sannyasin asks: I feel somehow detached from feeling hungry and eating. Before, it used to be that feeling hungry meant to eat, and now I’m very confused about eating and taking food.]\nOne has to feed the body. It is a great vehicle. It is a shrine, a temple of God. So one has to take every care – more care than you have ever taken before.\nIt is through the body that we are going to experience many more things. This moment comes if you go on meditating. When this moment comes, one day suddenly one realises, ‘I am not the body, so why bother?’ You are not the body, that’s true, but you are in the body. You are not this house but you keep it clean. Just because you are not the house you don’t make it dirty. Your body is just like the house.\nYou are in it; you are not it, that’s true. But when this realisation arises that ‘I am not the body’, this problem is natural. One feels, ‘Why bother? Why feed it? Why take so much care? Why bathe it? What is the need? If it disappears, it disappears.’\nThe understanding is good but can become suicidal. Many people have moved into a suicidal line from this point. It is a cross-road. You have to take care. This experience has come because of the body, it has come through the body. You have to be deeply grateful. You will attain to many more things through the body. One day you will attain to the deathless also but then too it is through the body.\nWhen St. Francis was dying, at the last moment he opened his eyes and started thanking his body. People thought that he had gone mad or something. What was he doing? He started thanking his body and saying, ‘You have been my vehicle. You have been my medium, my instrument. And you have brought me to this point where I am ready to meet my God. Many many thanks.’\nA really religious mind is thankful to the body also. But there are religious people who are against the body and they go on destroying the body. They are really psychotic; they are not religious. Something went wrong.\nSo this moment is critical. From this moment, start taking care of the body. The body is becoming more important than it ever was.\n[A sannyasin said that he was feeling much turmoil and pain in his third eye when he was doing certain meditations or exercises.\nOsho told him to stop the exercises that were provoking the pain... ]\nOne should be alert about what one is doing and what is happening. You must be doing many things. There is no need to do many meditations because you can do confusing things, contradictory things, and then pain will arise.\nChoose two meditations and stick to them. In fact I would like you to choose one; that would be the best. It is better to repeat one that suits you, many times. Then it will go deeper and deeper. You are trying many things – one day one thing, another day another thing. And you are inventing your own, so you can create many confusions.\nIn the book of Tantra there are one hundred and twelve meditations. You can go crazy. You are already crazy! [laughter] Just do two for a few days and then tell me. And don’t invent your own.\nNo, meditations are not fun. They can sometimes be dangerous. You are playing with a subtle, a very subtle mechanism of the mind. Sometimes a small thing that you were not aware you were doing can become dangerous.\nFor example, I told a couple to sit in front of each other and to look into each other’s left eye. They thought, ‘What is wrong with trying the right eye?’ They tried and both had terrific headaches. And they never told me that they were trying it with the right eye !\nIf you look into the left eye it is good, because the left eye is connected with the right brain, and the right brain is the meditative part of your brain. But if you look into the right eye, it is connected with the left brain and that is for reason, thinking, the scientific brain and it can create trouble.\nSo never try to invent, and don’t make your own hotch-potch meditation. Choose two and just try them for a few weeks. Even if you are tempted to do others, don’t. And then tell me. This pain will go.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"4295","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_cypress_in_the_courtyard/part12/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_cypress_in_the_courtyard/>The Cypress in the Courtyard</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">12</h1><div class=post-meta>21 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;4295 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Cypress_in_the_Courtyard/part12.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part11>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

therapies she had experienced in the States]</p><p><br></p><p>No method is for all persons – and no method can be. For each person
something suits, but something else does not. Sometimes the method that
suits somebody may be very destructive to somebody else. A method is
like medicine. It may suit somebody, may be of tremendous benefit, and
to somebody else it may become poison.</p><p><br></p><p>Just a few years before, physicians used to think that the medicine
relates to the disease and not to the person. Now they have changed that
idea. Two persons may be suffering from the same disease... and still
the medicine may not work. So now they say, ’Don’t treat the disease,
treat the person. Two persons suffering from the same disease... it
looks logical that the same medicine may work. But the disease is a
small part and the whole gestalt of the person is very big.</p><p><br></p><p>So the disease is different – maybe the symptoms are the same, but
two persons cannot suffer from the same disease because two persons are
not the same. As our fingerprints are different, exactly like that
everything else is different and unique, individual. So each individual
has to be regarded as an individual and cared for individually.</p><p><br></p><p>The West is too technology-oriented. Technology does not bother about
individuals. It does not believe in individuals; it believes in the
technique. So the technique becomes very important, and in reality the
individual is supreme.</p><p><br></p><p>So, many times it will happen that something does not suit you; so
then don’t try to fit with it. It can be destructive. Listen to your
heart. If it does not fit with you, then it is not for you – whatsoever
the authorities say.</p><p>The authorities have their own vested interests in it. They try to
make you feel guilty that something is wrong with you. They throw the
whole responsibility on you and save the technique. They say the
technique is perfect; you are defective. The technique is perfect; you
are not okay. The technique is perfect; you are not allowing it to work.
Then one starts feeling guilty, as if one is not dOing the right
thing.</p><p><br></p><p>So never feel guilty. Let that be my message for your sannyas day:
never feel guilty and never think in terms of your being made for some
technique, some method or means. No man is made for anything and
everything is made for man.</p><p><br></p><p>So the ultimate decision has to come from your innermost core. If it
suits, then go headlong. If it doesn’t suit, then watch. Whatsoever
others are saying, don’t be bothered. It may be suiting them. There is
no need to contradict them, no need to distract them, no need to convert
them to your own way. Simply remember that it may be suitable for them;
it is not suitable for you. And forget all about it.</p><p><br></p><p>Now so many techniques are about and people are moving from one
technique to another, doing this and that. Much confusion is going to be
created out of it. People will be left without roots. One technique you
uproot, with another technique you uproot something else. Unless
something suits, it will not get roots. Now this is a trend that even
when a technique suits, then too people go on looking for sensation, for
some thrill – maybe something more can happen somewhere else.</p><p><br></p><p>This vagrant mind, this mind of the wanderer, is not good, because a
tree has to remain in one spot lo get more deeply rooted. A person
should do many things before selecting a spot for himself. But once you
see that something is fitting, then forget all about what others are
saying, what others are doing. Move into it, otherwise there will be no
time left for finding roots.</p><p><br></p><p>[The sannyasin adds: I go on and on about my path, wondering which is
the right one. I feel it is meditation and yet I wish it were love.]</p><p><br></p><p>No, don’t worry, and don’t wish against it. Love will come. There is
no need to be concerned about it.</p><p><br></p><p>When I say love will come, I don’t mean that you have become unloving
or that you don’t love people. You love people, you are loving, but you
are not following love as the path to the divine. Human love is
perfectly okay. It is good, it is helpful, but technically you are not
moving towards God through love. You enjoy love, you share love. That’s
perfectly good. That has nothing to do with God. That’s your
delight.</p><p><br></p><p>But technically you are moving on the path of meditation. Soon you
will see more and more love arising. Go on loving People, dispersing
love, sharing your life, your being, with others, but always remember
that is not the path for you to be on. That may be your expression of
meditation but not the means to the goal.</p><p><br></p><p>When meditation is going well, suddenly love will bloom forth like
flowers in the spring. So you need not think about it, and don’t create
any anxiety about it. It is not a question of our wishing, because
wishes are very deceptive. The question is of feeling, not of wishing.
If you feel that meditation helps</p><p>you – you become more quiet, more calm, collected – then that is your
path. Love is not negated. It is not chosen as the path, that is
all.</p><p><br></p><p>Love will follow like a shadow.</p><p><br></p><p>Deva means divine and amitabh means infinite light – infinite divine
light. Amitabh is also a name of Buddha, because of his infinite light.
In Japan, Amitabh has become Amida. They call Buddha ‘Amida’, but it is
a form of Amitabh.</p><p><br></p><p>[The new sannyasin says: And all my life I’ve felt like my path was
the path of love, and yet I get so much from the meditations. I’m not
really struggling with the two, but I heard you say about one path or
the other... ]</p><p><br></p><p>No, no need to struggle. And no problems are ever solved. People who
are trying to solve them are moving in a false direction. They may find
some solutions but those solutions will be homemade because problems are
existential and solutions will be mind-products. So for a few days you
can concern yourself with the solution, but sooner or later they wear
out and the problems reassert themselves again, or the solutions will
give birth to more problems. Every solution creates more problems than
it solves.</p><p><br></p><p>The right path is to grow out of them, to grow beyond them, to
transcend them. Problems can never be solved, but they can be dissolved.
My whole effort here is to dissolve them, not to solve them.</p><p><br></p><p>A moment of pure consciousness comes where no problem exists – and no
solution. You are settled there with no problem to solve, and no
solution to carry and to remember. Everything has simply fallen,
withered away. This state is what satori is.</p><p><br></p><p>So the whole effort here is not to solve anybody’s problems. We are
not working philosophically. We are working existentially.</p><p><br></p><p>Existence knows no problems. Problems are man-created. In fact,
problems are because we are tense. It is not the other way around – that
we are tense because there are problems, no. Because we are tense, there
are problems. So once the tension is relaxed the problems disappear.</p><p><br></p><p>People ordinarily think that there are problems and that’s why we are
so anxious and worried. Not so. You are worried, anxious, so you cannot
live without problems. You create them. Your worry needs some problems
to hang on. So if one problem is solved, immediately you create
another.</p><p><br></p><p>Just solving problems is not going to help. It will be a sheer
wastage. So I try to cut the very root, the grass-root – and that is the
state of a tense mind. Once that state relaxes, all problems simply
disappear as dewdrops disappear in the morning.</p><p><br></p><p>Once you have known that moment – even for a single time – you have
the key in your hand, and whenever you want to you can open the door of
the temple and enter. If you want to enjoy a little worry and problems,
that’s up to you ! But now it is not a problem really, it is a game. If
you want to sharpen your mind against anxieties, do it. But then you
know that it is a game and you enjoy it.</p><p>In fact, anxiety is not anxiety then. It is as if you are solving a
crossword puzzle. It creates anxiety but that’s just a game. Or you are
playing cards or chess. You know that the whole thing is created by you.
Don’t play the game – get out of it! Nobody is forcing you to play it.
You enter it on your own initiative, voluntarily, because you enjoy that
sharpening, that state of tense consciousness. There is nothing wrong in
it.</p><p><br></p><p>But then the whole life is nothing but a chessboard and any moment
you want to get out of it you can throw the board and finish the game.
You have the key and you can move. Then problems are like toys and you
play with them. So that is exactly the point to be understood.</p><p><br></p><p>When you move into deep meditation everything becomes tremendous,
because so much energy is released – the same energy that is getting
caught in many nets and knots, anxieties, problems, tensions, worries,
depressions, sadness, this and that; so many knots around you.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard one joke.…</p><p><br></p><p>Visitor: What happened to the fellow in this cell? Attendant: He went
crazy trying to untie a knot in a string. Visitor: What is this other
fellow’s trouble?</p><p>Attendant: He went nuts trying to help the other fellow untie the
knot. Visitor: And who is the raving maniac in the padded cell?</p><p>Attendant: He’s the guy that tied the knot.</p><p><br></p><p>Through the whole of life we go on making many knots around us,
unknowingly, unconsciously. The way we live is so unalert that those
knots are created automatically. Then we try to solve them. Then we get
caught and the whole energy becomes diversified, divided and blocked
everywhere.</p><p><br></p><p>So when you start meditating, you start becoming loose from your
preoccupations, and the energy that was involved in it falls back on
you... a tremendous upsurge – unbelievable. Then everything becomes
tremendous. If you are angry, you are tremendously angry, or if you are
loving, you are tremendously loving. If you are sad, you are
tremendously sad. If you are happy, you are tremendously happy. This is
the first step into meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>By and by, you start seeing that when with the same energy you can be
tremendously happy, then why be tremendously sad? It is the same energy,
and it is so easy to change it from sadness to happiness, from anger to
compassion, from violence to love. It is so easy just as if you are
putting the light on and off. But if you don’t know the button, it looks
difficult.</p><p><br></p><p>A friend of Sigmund Freud, who was a poor man but had been childhood
friends with Freud, came to visit him from his village. He had never
seen electricity and it was for the first time that he saw it in Freud’s
house. Just so as not to look ignorant, he didn’t ask what it was.</p><p>In the night when he was left in his bedroom, he tried hard to figure
out how to put it off. If you have never seen electricity, it is almost
impossible for you to conceive that somewhere just behind the door there
is a knob which yon just have to push and the electricity will be off.
He had known only lamps, kerosene lamps and other things, so he stood on
a chair and studied the light but it seemed impossible to extinguish
it.</p><p><br></p><p>He tried the whole night but he couldn’t put off the light. In the
morning Freud asked, ‘You slept well?’</p><p><br></p><p>The man said, ‘Everything was okay but I couldn’t sleep because of
this light. Tell me – it’s miraculous – how do you put it off?’</p><p><br></p><p>Freud said, ‘Why didn’t you ask me?!’ And the man said, ‘I am just
foolish and I didn’t want to look ignorant, so I tried to find a way but
I couldn’t.’</p><p><br></p><p>So if you don’t know, it is very difficult to think that the same
energy can become anger, and the same energy can become love. The same
energies can move the fan, can give you light, can run your car, can do
a thousand and one things, on the surface completely unrelated to each
other. What is the relationship between a fan and a lightbulb? On the
surface there is no relationship, but deep down it is the same
current.</p><p><br></p><p>So the second step will be to look deeply and see that it is the same
energy. Then it is foolish to waste it in anger and sadness. Why not be
happy? A moment comes when one is simply happy. Not that one becomes
happy; one is simply happy... happiness becomes one’s climate. In fact
one completely forgets that one is happy. Then only is one happy.
Happiness is then so engrained, so natural, so spontaneous, just like
breathing.</p><p><br></p><p>If there is some trouble you become aware of your breathing;
otherwise there is no need. It goes on functioning so smoothly. It is
just like when you have a headache then you remember your head, but
otherwise why? If your body is perfectly healthy you forget the body.
Only an ill person knows that he has a body. A healthy person forgets.
He becomes bodiless.</p><p><br></p><p>In indian medicine, health is defined as the feeling of bodilessness.
I have never come across a better definition. Western medicine defines
health as an absence of illness. That is not a true definition. If you
have to bring in illness to define health it is a very negative
definition. Absence of illness is not much of a health because there is
no positive element in it.</p><p><br></p><p>It is possible that a man may not have any illness and may not be
healthy either, because health has a positive well-being in it. The
indian definition seems to be very refined: the feeling of bodilessness.
When the shoe fits, one forgets the feet. When the shoe is not fitting,
then you remember it. When the body fits completely, you forget all
about it. Then you are a nobody.</p><p><br></p><p>To be a somebody is to be ill. The very feeling that ‘I am somebody’
is ill. To be nobody is perfectly healthy.</p><p><br></p><p>And much is going to happen... leave everything to me. Now I will be
responsible. You can be absolutely irresponsible.</p><p>[To a visitor from Israel who was unable to stay much longer, Osho
suggested he do meditation regularly, saying that dancing, particularly
would be helpful for him... ]</p><p><br></p><p>You can create a small group of friends who can dance together. That
will be better, more helpful. Man is so weak that alone it is difficult
to continue anything. Hence, schools are needed. So if you are not
feeling like doing it one day and others are, their energy moves you.
Someday somebody else is not feeling like it but you are, so your energy
comes through.</p><p><br></p><p>Left alone, man is very weak and willless. One day you do it and
another day you feel that you are tired and have other things to do.
Meditations bring results only when they are done in a persistent way.
Then it sinks inside you.</p><p><br></p><p>It is just as if you are digging a hole in the earth. One day you dig
in one place, another day in another place. Then you can go on digging
for the whole of your life but the well will never be ready. You have to
dig in the same place continuously.</p><p><br></p><p>So make it a point, at the same time every day. And if in the same
place it is possible, very good; the same room, the same atmosphere,
burn the same incense... so the body by and by learns and the mind by
and by gets the feel of it. The moment you enter the room you are ready
to dance. The room is charged, the time is charged.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s how temples, churches, synagogues came to exist in the world.
In the beginning they were beautiful places. People came again and again
to the same place, to the same atmosphere. Once they entered the
synagogue or the temple, they entered a different world from their
ordinary world. That very feeling helps to change the mood.</p><p><br></p><p>So if you can find a place where you can go every day, every night or
morning, do it, mm?</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin reports back to Osho after being advised to accept his
mind (see ‘Beloved of my Heart’ May 10th.):</p><p><br></p><p>I feel more conscious of what I’m doing... but I’d like to be able to
do what I’m doing, rather than thinking all the time what I’m going to
do next.]</p><p><br></p><p>Everybody is trying to improve and to become somebody – and that’s
absurd. Nobody ever becomes anybody. Everybody remains himself or
herself, so the whole effort is a wastage. It is good for you to accept
yourself, but I still think something is lurking in the mind. Just
accept and don’t create any tension.</p><p><br></p><p>I want you to be completely rid of your guilt feelings so that the
division is no more there. You are two [of you]. One is trying to
manipulate the other; the top dog continuously trying to manipulate the
bottom dog. The bottom dog is also very cunning; he has to be. He goes
on saying, ‘Yes sir, yes sir,’ but he goes on doing his own thing.</p><p><br></p><p>Drop this division. Whatsoever happens is good. Don’t judge. Just
remain with whatsoever is. There is no other way for it to be. It is
very difficult because it is against the ego. The ego says, ‘Something
better is possible. Something more is possible. I can do this and that,
and I can become somebody.’</p><p>The ego does not feel good with deep acceptance. In fact deep
acceptance will become a death to the ego. The ego thrives on
conflict.</p><p><br></p><p>So just float. You are looking better. You have not looked so good
for many months . . . relaxed. If you feel like doing something, do it
but don’t make it a drive. When you have completely relaxed and there is
no guilt, then I will tell you to do many things. But first this guilt
has to go. If it remains it will again jump and will possess you
again.</p><p><br></p><p>So there is nothing to do right now – simply float. When you feel
like meditating, meditate, otherwise simply be.</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin said:... a thought came into my head that only God is
important. And then somehow the word ‘important’ dropped and I had to
say ‘God is only’.</p><p><br></p><p>He goes on to ask about dropping his attachment to his mother who has
passed over.]</p><p><br></p><p>Good... very good. Good things are happening. Nothing is important,
and when nothing is important, that which is left is important – call it
God. Better not to give it any name because once we give it a name we
start having some idea, some definition, some limitation. No need to
give it a name.. This much is enough: nothing is important.</p><p><br></p><p>And if one can remember that nothing is important, one becomes
detached spontaneously, by and by. No need to practise detachment. Just
in the very realisation that nothing is important, one becomes detached.
That detachment is beautiful.</p><p><br></p><p>If you practise detachment it is ugly, because deep down the
attachment continues. You go on fighting with it and you create the
opposite but the conflict continues. And wherever there is conflict
there is ugliness. And wherever there is no conflict there is beauty.
Beauty is energy moving into deep harmony without any conflict.</p><p><br></p><p>Nothing is important, but when you repeat this, remember that nothing
is unimportant either. Unimportance is a byproduct. If something is
important, only then is something unimportant. Nothing is important
because nothing is unimportant. Things simply are. If we are attached to
them we call them important. If we are not attached to them we call them
unimportant.</p><p><br></p><p>Importance and unimportance come because of our attachment. Once the
attachment is not there, things simply are – unlabelled, unclassified.
They don’t belong to any category: important, unimportant, valuable, not
valuable, profane, sacred. The world is simply there then in its total
nakedness and its total beauty.</p><p><br></p><p>Sheer purity is there... one is surrounded by innocence. It has been
good. Continue to remember it.</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin asks: I feel somehow detached from feeling hungry and
eating. Before, it used to be that feeling hungry meant to eat, and now
I’m very confused about eating and taking food.]</p><p><br></p><p>One has to feed the body. It is a great vehicle. It is a shrine, a
temple of God. So one has to take every care – more care than you have
ever taken before.</p><p>It is through the body that we are going to experience many more
things. This moment comes if you go on meditating. When this moment
comes, one day suddenly one realises, ‘I am not the body, so why
bother?’ You are not the body, that’s true, but you are in the body. You
are not this house but you keep it clean. Just because you are not the
house you don’t make it dirty. Your body is just like the house.</p><p><br></p><p>You are in it; you are not it, that’s true. But when this realisation
arises that ‘I am not the body’, this problem is natural. One feels,
‘Why bother? Why feed it? Why take so much care? Why bathe it? What is
the need? If it disappears, it disappears.’</p><p><br></p><p>The understanding is good but can become suicidal. Many people have
moved into a suicidal line from this point. It is a cross-road. You have
to take care. This experience has come because of the body, it has come
through the body. You have to be deeply grateful. You will attain to
many more things through the body. One day you will attain to the
deathless also but then too it is through the body.</p><p><br></p><p>When St. Francis was dying, at the last moment he opened his eyes and
started thanking his body. People thought that he had gone mad or
something. What was he doing? He started thanking his body and saying,
‘You have been my vehicle. You have been my medium, my instrument. And
you have brought me to this point where I am ready to meet my God. Many
many thanks.’</p><p><br></p><p>A really religious mind is thankful to the body also. But there are
religious people who are against the body and they go on destroying the
body. They are really psychotic; they are not religious. Something went
wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>So this moment is critical. From this moment, start taking care of
the body. The body is becoming more important than it ever was.</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin said that he was feeling much turmoil and pain in his
third eye when he was doing certain meditations or exercises.</p><p><br></p><p>Osho told him to stop the exercises that were provoking the pain...
]</p><p><br></p><p>One should be alert about what one is doing and what is happening.
You must be doing many things. There is no need to do many meditations
because you can do confusing things, contradictory things, and then pain
will arise.</p><p><br></p><p>Choose two meditations and stick to them. In fact I would like you to
choose one; that would be the best. It is better to repeat one that
suits you, many times. Then it will go deeper and deeper. You are trying
many things – one day one thing, another day another thing. And you are
inventing your own, so you can create many confusions.</p><p><br></p><p>In the book of Tantra there are one hundred and twelve meditations.
You can go crazy. You are already crazy! [laughter] Just do two for a
few days and then tell me. And don’t invent your own.</p><p><br></p><p>No, meditations are not fun. They can sometimes be dangerous. You are
playing with a subtle, a very subtle mechanism of the mind. Sometimes a
small thing that you were not aware you were doing can become
dangerous.</p><p>For example, I told a couple to sit in front of each other and to
look into each other’s left eye. They thought, ‘What is wrong with
trying the right eye?’ They tried and both had terrific headaches. And
they never told me that they were trying it with the right eye !</p><p><br></p><p>If you look into the left eye it is good, because the left eye is
connected with the right brain, and the right brain is the meditative
part of your brain. But if you look into the right eye, it is connected
with the left brain and that is for reason, thinking, the scientific
brain and it can create trouble.</p><p><br></p><p>So never try to invent, and don’t make your own hotch-potch
meditation. Choose two and just try them for a few weeks. Even if you

AND AFTERWARDS I FEEL ALMOST ASHAMED, AS THOUGH I HAVE SAID SOMETHING WHICH I HAVE NO RIGHT TO SAY.\nIN THESE YEARS OF BEING WITH YOU, I KNOW I HAVE CHANGED. LAYERS AND LAYERS HAVE DISAPPEARED, AND A SILENCE HAS ARISEN WHICH IS NEVER SO FAR AWAY THAT IT FEELS OUT OF REACH. YET I OFTEN WONDER IF THE CLARITY I FEEL COMING OUT OF THIS SILENCE IS ONLY “SO-CALLED” – SOME KIND OF ARROGANCE IN DISGUISE, OR SOME IMAGINING, UNKNOWN TO ME.\nI DON’T KNOW IF THIS IS A QUESTION, OR THREE QUESTIONS, OR AN APOLOGY. BELOVED OSHO, COULD YOU HELP ME SORT IT OUT?\nDeva Sarito, life is such a mystery that the more you know the more you become aware of your ignorance. Or in other words, the more you know it, the less you know it. And the day you know it all, you know nothing.\nIt has been said that science starts from not knowing and ends in knowing – that’s exactly the meaning of the word ‘science’: knowing. And religion starts from knowing and reaches to its climax\nin not knowing – because not knowing is another name of innocence. And if religion cannot bring you back your childhood, and the freshness of childhood, and the wondering eyes of childhood, it is not religion at all.\nWhatever is happening to you is perfectly the way it should happen. You have every right to say what you have experienced, what you have felt, what changes you have gone through. It is most important to say it, because it is unfortunately the situation that people who know nothing about me even write books against me.\nAll over the world, in all the languages, people who have never come in contact with me, have never heard me, feel perfectly right in writing all kinds of lies and rumors and allegations without any foundation, without any factuality behind them. The negative person is always very articulate, because to say no, you don’t need any intelligence; any idiot can do it. But to say yes needs tremendous courage, and a great intelligence. And the people who say yes, the people who feel yes, are always keeping their secret hiding in their heart. This creates a very unbalanced situation. Those who don’t know me go on writing anything, out of the blue.\nNow there is an article in a German magazine, SPIEGEL, saying that I am trying to come to Germany and create a commune in Germany on the same lines as was created in America. So the government has to be aware, and the people of Germany have to be aware. Now, from where do these people get these ideas? I have not even dreamt about going to Germany. Even if they want me to be there, I will refuse. A few days ago in Israel, a Hebrew newspaper had an article saying that the people of Israel have to be clearly aware of the danger, because I am planning to come to Israel. And they say my strategy is that I will be converted to the religion of the Jews, and once I am a Jew, then I will declare that I am the incarnation of Moses!\nWhat to do with these people? – and people read them, people believe them. And the people who know me, who have come into deep inner communion with me, who have experienced me, remain silent.\nIt is not new. It is part of a strange human psychology. The positive person is humble; even to say something he feels embarrassed, because he knows that whatever he is going to say is not going to be up to the experience that he had. It is going to fall very short; hence the embarrassment.\nBut the negative person has no fear, no embarrassment. He has not experienced anything. And to deny or to lie, or to create a fiction, is sensational. The people who have been writing against me\n... all the publishers are eager to publish their books – without knowing what they are writing, all kinds of rubbish. And a few of my sannyasins who have been with me from the very beginning have written books just to answer those lies and allegations, with facts and figures, with solid arguments.\nThe publishers are not willing to publish them. They say there is no sensation in it. Lies have sensation; the truth is non-sensational. And the masses are interested in sensationalism, they are not interested in knowing the truth. Truth is simple and plain.\nBut this situation has to be reversed; there is a limit to everything. The positive people have to come out in the light, and tell with emphasis their own experiences and what they understand about me and my relationship to my people. Unless they come out and do it, they are in an indirect way\nhelping the negative people. Because if those negative people are not contradicted, it becomes an argument in their favor – why are they not contradicted?\nSo I can understand, Sarito, that you have experiences to express but it is always bound to be something not absolutely the experience. It is going to be something far below. But still it will help people to understand both sides. The negative is articulate, but is meaningless; it is not going to help anybody. It can only prevent people from coming to me. And the people who are writing all those negative books and articles – they cannot help anybody either. So they are really public enemies.\nThe positive person has to come out so the negative people can be contradicted, and so that those who are in search of truth, in search of silence and peace, can feel a possibility: if they come here, maybe if it is happening to other people, it can happen to them also. You will be opening doors, and you will be giving invitations to new sannyasins, to new seekers.\nSo don’t keep it as a secret. Don’t enjoy it inside yourself; share it with as many people as possible, with all the news media, so that you can reach to the farthest corners of the world.\nAnd the positive person has many problems which the negative does not have. First, the positive person starts thinking, “Perhaps my silence, my joy, my bliss, is just imagination.” The negative person has no problem; he knows exactly that it is imagination, there is no problem about it! The problem arises only to the positive person – because it is not imagination.\nLiving here for years ... Imagination is a very momentary phenomenon; you cannot go on living in imagination for twelve years, fifteen years. It is possible to live in imagination for a few moments – imagination is not reality; imagination is just like soap bubbles. For a moment they can shine in the sun, create a rainbow, and then they are gone and all those rainbows disappear.\nAnd one thing more you have to understand, for yourself: you cannot imagine silence; that is not in the nature of things. You can imagine all kinds of thoughts, but you cannot imagine thoughtlessness. Nobody has ever been able to do it, it is almost impossible. You cannot imagine blissfulness. You don’t have any idea, how can you imagine it? Imagination needs some kind of experience; then you can project it. But blissfulness you don’t know.\nYou can imagine misery perfectly well. You are so deeply rooted in misery that there is no problem. You know it, you can imagine it, you can exaggerate it, you can magnify it a thousandfold; it is in your hands. But blissfulness you don’t know. Anything that you don’t know is not possible for you to imagine.\nSo if you are feeling silence, peace, bliss; if you are feeling changes happening in you, in your consciousness, it is not imagination.\nSecondly, you are worried that it may be “some kind of arrogance in disguise.” One who is aware that his experiences may be some kind of arrogance, has really gone beyond arrogance, because arrogance never recognizes itself. The egoist never recognizes that he is egoistic; the arrogant cannot even think that he is arrogant.\nTo be worried that perhaps it may be arrogance is part of humbleness. Only a humble person becomes concerned that he should not say anything, he should not do anything that may bring\narrogance from the back door. He knows the misery of arrogance, he knows the pain and the anguish of arrogance. He does not want to get into that trap again. But if you are aware, arrogance cannot come close to you, just as when you have light in your house, darkness cannot come in.\nGautam Buddha used to say, “You should be like a house which has light inside. When the house, its doors, its windows, are showing light, thieves don’t come close. But when the house is dark and there is no light, it is an opportunity for thieves.” And by thieves he means all that destroys your beauty, your grandeur, all that takes away your treasures. Arrogance, ego, aggressiveness, superiority, the idea of being special – all are destroying you and your peace; they are destroying your nobodiness.\nYou cannot imagine nobodiness. It is almost like ... a beggar can dream of being a king – in fact beggars always dream, and in their dreams they fulfill the desires which they cannot fulfill in their actual waking lives. But nobody has ever heard of a king dreaming about himself being a beggar; that is unknown. Why should one dream of being a beggar? The hungry person can dream that he has been invited to a royal party; he can dream about delicious food – he has to, just to hide his hunger. But the man who is living in the palace and eating delicious food is not going to dream that he is hungry; that is just illogical, unpsychological.\nWe dream only of things which we don’t have; we imagine things only which we don’t have. But once you start having real experiences, those experiences start changing your lifestyle, your responses to situations; you can start feeling constantly within you a coolness, a grace, a gratitude towards existence, and out of this peacefulness, silence, beauty, all your actions arise ... they also have something of it. Your words come out from the silences of your heart; they also have some music from their original source.\nIt is a well-known fact: a man like Jesus was uneducated, but no rabbi in the whole history of Judaism, four thousand years – and Jewish rabbis are great scholars, unparalleled in any other religion – but no Jewish rabbi has spoken the way an uneducated carpenter’s son, Jesus, spoke. And he knew nothing of scripture, he knew nothing of the art of oratory. Even those who were not in agreement with him had to say, “One thing we cannot deny: nobody has ever spoken the way he speaks.”\nAnd he is using simple words, ordinary words used by common people, but on his lips those ordinary words have a changed quality. They are coming from a depth; they are bringing some fragrance with them, they are bringing some authority of his experience. The same words are available ... all the Christian missionaries are repeating the same words every day. But you don’t feel any impact, you don’t see ... Why the difference?\nThe difference is that Jesus was speaking out of experience, and these people are speaking only out of their education. For Jesus, it was his life. For these missionaries, it is their salary; it is their livelihood, not their life. For Jesus, what he was saying was so important that he was ready to sacrifice his life, but not to compromise on any ground. But these missionaries, if somebody gives them a better salary, will change their religion immediately. These are professionals. Their words don’t have any depth. Their words are not alive, but corpses. They look similar, they sound similar, but you can see when you hear a missionary .…\nOne of the most famous missionaries in both parts of the world, East and West, was Stanley Jones. He used to live for six months in the East – he had a beautiful ashram in the Himalayas – and for six months he used to live in the West. I have come across many missionaries, but the caliber that Stanley Jones had, none of them have had. He was a genius. But even a genius cannot put life into words that are not his experience.\nI told him ... because he used to stay very near to where I was a teacher in the university, and slowly we became very intimate. He was a sincere man. I said, “There is a difference – you may accept it, you may not accept it. These are the same words spoken by Jesus, which you speak every day in your sermons, but something is missing. They sound the same; they are exactly the same words. And perhaps you are pronouncing them better than Jesus. He was uneducated, you are a genius” – and he was one of the best speakers – “and Jesus has nothing as far as the art of oratory is concerned. But his words had a life, his words had wings; they reached you as alive beings, not just corpses. Not just stuffed, dead birds, looking alive.”\nHe was silent for a moment and he said, “Perhaps you are right. Whatever I am saying is my education, is my scholarship, is my lifelong learning. What Jesus was saying was not his learning; he never went to any school. What he was saying was his experience; his words were coming from a living source.”\nThe positive person has to become assertive; he has to come into the light. Otherwise the world is left in the hands of the negative people, and these negative people are the cause of preventing others from seeking and searching.\nI have always liked a story by Turgenev – a Russian novelist, one of the best the world has ever known. If you are going to choose ten great books, you will have to give one place to Turgenev without fail. Out of all the literature in all the languages in the world, he may claim more, but one is absolutely certain. He has written a small story, THE FOOL.\nIn a small village there was a very simple man. His simplicity was such that he almost looked like a simpleton, and the whole village condemned him as the idiot. Out of his simplicity he used to do things, and the cunning people all around condemned him. He became so much afraid even to say a single word, because whatever he would say, he would be immediately criticized, condemned. He became afraid of acting, of doing anything; his life became a hell. And at that time, a mystic passed through the village. The idiot reached the mystic and told his tragic story, asking, “You help me do something”\nThe mystic said, “Who says you are an idiot? You are a very simple, innocent being. Out of your innocence you do things which are going to be against the ideas of the cunning and the clever.\n“You do one thing – I will be coming back on the same route within a month, so I can check whether it works or not – I will tell you a simple secret. From tomorrow morning, you become assertive, aggressive: Somebody says, ‘What a beautiful sunrise’ and you immediately jump in and tell him, ‘What is there? What beauty are you talking about? What is beauty? Define it! I have seen many sunrises like this; it is just a mediocre sunrise – what is special in it? It happens every day.’ And nobody can define beauty, nobody can prove that the sunrise is beautiful. There is no argument, there is no way.\n“Somebody is saying, ‘Look at that woman, how beautiful she is!’ Immediately jump in. You just watch, wherever anybody is making a positive statement about higher values which cannot be proved, you ask for proof: ‘What do you mean by calling that ordinary woman, who is not even homely ... what beauty is in her? Where is it? – in her eyes, in her nose, in her hair? Where is the beauty? You have to clearly define it, and point to where it is!’” Now, beauty is not something that can be pinpointed.\nAfter one month when the mystic returned, the idiot had become by that time the wisest man in the village. Somebody would say, “That is a holy book,” and he would immediately ask, “What do you mean by holy, and what is holy in this book? The paper used is holy, or the ink used is holy, or the words used are holy? What is holy in it? These are the same words, the same ink, the same paper used in every book – what makes this book holy?” And there was no way to prove .…\nAnd people became absolutely afraid in his presence. They would tremble, they would not say anything; the situation was completely reversed.\nBefore, he used to be afraid; now he was never afraid. And nobody even asked a question of him\n... because the mystic had said, “If somebody asks a question, never answer, but ask a counter- question – because your answer can be criticized; don’t be caught in that thing. Just ask a counter- question. Ask, ‘What do you mean by this question? Explain each single word and its meaning.’ And harass him so much that even an ordinary sentence becomes a puzzle.”\nThe mystic came; the idiot touched his feet and said, “Your strategy worked. Now I am the wisest man in this village.”\nHe said, “Don’t be worried – continue. You will be the wisest man in the whole surrounding area, as far as your name can reach! People will start coming to you just to have your blessings.”\nA small story, but with great significance. It says how even an idiot, by using negativity, can become wise.\nBut that is not true wisdom. True wisdom is always positive. True wisdom is always arising out of a yes, out of love, out of gratitude towards existence. True wisdom knows no “no.” It does not have any contact with negative attitudes and approaches.\nYou are perfectly right. Just don’t remain silent. Bring your silence into songs, bring your experience into expressions. Say to the world what you have known, without fear.\nThe last thing to be remembered:\nThe negative person is always restless, because he has nothing; he is empty, he is angry, he is unfulfilled. Out of his unfulfillment, angriness, emptiness, he becomes more and more revengeful, violent. The positive person, the person who has experienced something, becomes calm and quiet. Naturally, he has no need to assert. He has no need to say anything; he is so deeply fulfilled that he does not want to waste his breath unnecessarily fighting. He simply remains settled in his own center.\nAnd this settlement becomes more and more and more and more – to a point that he completely forgets. Not only that he forgets misery, he forgets blissfulness – he becomes so accustomed to bliss ... he breathes bliss in and out, day in, day out. It becomes simply his very being; he forgets that he is blissful, that he is experiencing ecstasy. These are just as natural to him as breathing or heartbeats.\nBefore it happens, you should make an effort – just out of compassion – to show the way to others. They are all groping in darkness; they want some door to open. They are tired of their chains and their handcuffs, and they want somebody to help them to be freed, somebody to say to them that “Yes, there is freedom.” They have become so suspicious – perhaps there is nothing like freedom, nothing like blissfulness, nothing like ecstasy. And these negative people go on telling them that these are all imaginations, these are all hypnotic trances; these are not realities. But their innermost beings are thirsty, although their minds are filled and distracted and corrupted by the negative people.\nThose who experience something that can be a valuable assurance and encouragement to anybody, anywhere – so that his hope arises again that some window can be opened, that there are doors which he has missed; that he has listened to wrong people, that he has been under the impact of negative darkness and he has not opened his eyes to the positive light – before you become completely satisfied, you have to help people.\nYou can do it only before you become so settled that you forget at all that you are blissful. Bliss can be experienced only in contrast to misery, and if you have been blissful for years, you have forgotten misery, how it used to be; now bliss has become your only experience. The gap – when you are dropping the misery and moving towards bliss, when you have seen the star for the first time – that is the moment when you should express yourself ... “Nobody needs to be a pessimist, nobody needs to drop his hopes. I have seen the star.”\nBut it has to be done quickly, when you see it. When you become the star yourself, then it will be too late. You will not be able to say anything; even the desire to communicate will disappear.\nI have heard the pope died, and went to heaven. Saint Peter asked him whom among the saints he would like to meet. “Saint Mary, the mother of Jesus Christ,” said the pope.\nSaint Peter leads him into a palatial hall. There in a far corner sits an old Jewish lady. The pope approaches her reverently, and sinks to his knees: “Oh, holy mother of God,” he says, “all my life on earth I have been looking forward to this blessed moment. There is one question I want to ask you: What was it like to give birth to our Lord Jesus Christ?” The old lady wags her head and smiles. “Well, actually we wanted a girl,” she said.\nThe mother of Jesus Christ is bound to become accustomed to Jesus Christ – he is nothing special to her, her own son. She is disappointed, because they wanted a daughter and they have got a son who is a troublemaker! Because of him, they are condemned, and because of him, in their old age they have to go through great anguish and suffering because he is crucified.\nWhen all the disciples had escaped, the mother was sitting there underneath the cross where Jesus was crucified, crying and weeping. And she must have been thinking it would have been better if a\ngirl had been born. A son – and him too, a son who gets crucified in her old age. And he was so young, only thirty-three. He has given his parents nothing but anxiety. To the pope it is one thing – Jesus Christ is God – but to the old Jewish lady, the mother of Jesus, he was just a troublemaker, unnecessarily disturbing the peace, unnecessarily leaving them in their old age in immense misery because of the crucifixion.\nIf Jesus Christ is born to you, you will become accustomed. If bliss is born in your being, you will become accustomed. Before you become accustomed, spread the good news as far and wide as possible. There are millions of thirsty people – under the impact of negative, sensational, articulate people, they are suffering in a kind of limbo. They hear only the negative side of things. Naturally they become suspicious of whether any positive side exists at all, or if they are unnecessarily running after shadows and phantoms – because all these clever people are writing against the possibility.\nFor the new humanity, millions of changes are going to happen. One of the most major changes will be that the positive person has to become articulate. He has to say to the world what he is experiencing, without any fear, without any embarrassment, without any suspicions that it may be imagination. Even if it is imagination, it may do good.\nBut it is not imagination. You cannot imagine spiritual experiences; you don’t have any notion what they are. Unless you know them, there is no way of imagining them, and when you have known them, there is no question of imagination.\nThe people in the world are in immense need of a few articulate, positive, assertive individuals. Not only their words will be helpful, but their presence – because their words can only be supported by their presence, by their actions, by their responses. There is no other kind of evidence. If people see that you are really living peace, that your life is a song of silence and each of your actions shows it, we can change the whole negative and sick psychology of man.\nOtherwise ... these negative people have been predominant all through history – because it is very easy to be negative, anybody can do it. Anybody can say, even to Gautam Buddha, that “Whatever you are saying is all nonsense.” And even a man like Gautam Buddha cannot produce any evidence of his enlightenment. If the person is adamant, stubborn, closed, there is no way.\nBuddha can help the person if he is open, vulnerable, receptive, ready to feel Buddha’s presence, ready to feel his fragrance, ready to become part of his silence. But most of the people in the world are living under the impact of negative people. This impact has created such an unconscious state\n... people go on falling more and more into unconsciousness, into darkness.\nSometimes I think that the Eastern idea has some psychological significance. It may not be true factually and historically, but psychologically ... nobody has explored the idea. Just as Charles Darwin proposed the idea of evolution, the East has believed for thousands of years in a contrary idea of involution, not evolution; that man is not growing higher, but falling lower; that the first golden age was in the very beginning.\nIt is worth understanding the whole idea as a psychological interpretation – not as history, not as science, but as psychology.\nThe first age, according to the Eastern mystics is called satyuga, the age of truth, the golden age. In a way we can see that each man passes through that golden age again when he is a child. When the whole humanity was in its childhood, then the idea becomes very relevant. Children have to learn to speak lies; otherwise, they simply speak the truth, without any learning. Truth is not to be learned, it is just out of your innocence.\nLying needs learning, cleverness, cunningness, calculativeness. Truth needs only innocence.\nSo the first age in the Eastern calculation was satyuga, the age of truth. They have called it “the golden age.” Their description is tremendously significant. Describing satyuga they say it was like a table with four legs, absolutely balanced. Satyuga had four legs, which kept it absolutely balanced. Then things started falling down.\nThe theory is exactly against Charles Darwin – I call it “involution.” One leg dropped. The table became very unbalanced; life became unbalanced. Things were no longer the same as they had been – peaceful, silent, tranquil. With three legs, all balance was lost – but still, the table can be converted into a tripod. A tripod has three legs; some balance is still possible. This second age is called treta, because of three legs – treta means three. The English word ‘three’ comes from the Sanskrit root, tre, and treta also comes from the same root. Life was no longer golden. Innocence was lost – that was the leg that was missing – people became more clever, more cunning.\nThen as days went by, things went down more. The third age is called dwapar. One more leg dropped; only two legs remained. All balance was lost. Dwapar is the same as the English word two. Dwapar comes from the Sanskrit root, dwa. Dwa has moved through many languages, reaching a few languages as twa ... and by the time it reached the English language, it became two. But it is the same word. Life became ugly, more barbarous, with more exploitation, more negativity.\nAnd we are in the fourth – one leg has fallen again; now we are standing only on one leg. The fourth is called kaliyuga, the age of darkness. And it seems certainly true that we are living in an age of darkness and unconsciousness. We are preparing for our own suicide – what more unconsciousness can there be? The future seems to be absolutely meaningless. It seems that every day the end of life is coming closer; the night goes on becoming darker and darker.\nEven small children have been found in thousands taking drugs; it is no longer the new generation, it is no longer young people – school kids are taking drugs. School kids have been found murdering other children, school kids have been found raping girls – and not as an exception. In America they had a survey, and they could not believe ... the government tried hard to repress it, not to let it be known to the world, but it leaked out.\nThe most advanced nation, most powerful, most scientifically, technologically advanced, is going through the darkest period in the whole of human history.\nThis unconsciousness can be broken only if the people whose life has become meditation, whose life has become a pure love, whose life has become a compassion, start waking up other sleeping people: “It is time – get ready. As the night becomes darker, the dawn is closer, but if you go on sleeping, dawn or no dawn, your night continues. Your eyes are closed, your darkness continues.”\nOtherwise, a new dawn for the whole human race, a new innocence, a new childhood, a new satyuga – the age of truth – a new golden age is possible. But the positive people have to take the bold step of expressing themselves. They have not been doing that for the whole of history. They have enjoyed their experience, and they have thought their work was finished.\nI want you to remember always:\nWhen you have something to share, don’t stop there; share it. Humanity is in need, as it has never been in need, of people who can create new hope for a new dawn.\nA Jew comes to an inn, very late at night, and is forced to share a room with a Russian officer. Not wanting to meet him, he asks the innkeeper to wake him up very early in the morning because he has to catch the first train.\nThe Jew undresses and goes to bed, and is awakened by the innkeeper when it is still dark outside. He dresses quickly and goes out, and to his surprise, all the soldiers salute him. When he mounts the train he looks at the mirror and realizes he is wearing a uniform. “Damn the innkeeper,” cries the Jew. “He woke up the wrong man!”\nOkay, Maneesha? Yes, Osho.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"5320","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_new_dawn/part14/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_new_dawn/>The New Dawn</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">14 Words from the silences of your heart</h1><div class=post-meta>25 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;5320 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_New_Dawn/part14.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part13>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

WORDS THAT SEEM TO COME FROM SOME PLACE EITHER BEYOND OR DEEP INSIDE
WHEN THEY HAPPEN. AND AFTERWARDS I FEEL ALMOST ASHAMED, AS THOUGH I HAVE
SAID SOMETHING WHICH I HAVE NO RIGHT TO SAY.</p><p><br></p><p>IN THESE YEARS OF BEING WITH YOU, I KNOW I HAVE CHANGED. LAYERS AND
LAYERS HAVE DISAPPEARED, AND A SILENCE HAS ARISEN WHICH IS NEVER SO FAR
AWAY THAT IT FEELS OUT OF REACH. YET I OFTEN WONDER IF THE CLARITY I
FEEL COMING OUT OF THIS SILENCE IS ONLY “SO-CALLED” – SOME KIND OF
ARROGANCE IN DISGUISE, OR SOME IMAGINING, UNKNOWN TO ME.</p><p><br></p><p>I DON’T KNOW IF THIS IS A QUESTION, OR THREE QUESTIONS, OR AN
APOLOGY. BELOVED OSHO, COULD YOU HELP ME SORT IT OUT?</p><p><br></p><p>Deva Sarito, life is such a mystery that the more you know the more
you become aware of your ignorance. Or in other words, the more you know
it, the less you know it. And the day you know it all, you know
nothing.</p><p><br></p><p>It has been said that science starts from not knowing and ends in
knowing – that’s exactly the meaning of the word ‘science’: knowing. And
religion starts from knowing and reaches to its climax</p><p>in not knowing – because not knowing is another name of innocence.
And if religion cannot bring you back your childhood, and the freshness
of childhood, and the wondering eyes of childhood, it is not religion at
all.</p><p><br></p><p>Whatever is happening to you is perfectly the way it should happen.
You have every right to say what you have experienced, what you have
felt, what changes you have gone through. It is most important to say
it, because it is unfortunately the situation that people who know
nothing about me even write books against me.</p><p><br></p><p>All over the world, in all the languages, people who have never come
in contact with me, have never heard me, feel perfectly right in writing
all kinds of lies and rumors and allegations without any foundation,
without any factuality behind them. The negative person is always very
articulate, because to say no, you don’t need any intelligence; any
idiot can do it. But to say yes needs tremendous courage, and a great
intelligence. And the people who say yes, the people who feel yes, are
always keeping their secret hiding in their heart. This creates a very
unbalanced situation. Those who don’t know me go on writing anything,
out of the blue.</p><p><br></p><p>Now there is an article in a German magazine, SPIEGEL, saying that I
am trying to come to Germany and create a commune in Germany on the same
lines as was created in America. So the government has to be aware, and
the people of Germany have to be aware. Now, from where do these people
get these ideas? I have not even dreamt about going to Germany. Even if
they want me to be there, I will refuse. A few days ago in Israel, a
Hebrew newspaper had an article saying that the people of Israel have to
be clearly aware of the danger, because I am planning to come to Israel.
And they say my strategy is that I will be converted to the religion of
the Jews, and once I am a Jew, then I will declare that I am the
incarnation of Moses!</p><p><br></p><p>What to do with these people? – and people read them, people believe
them. And the people who know me, who have come into deep inner
communion with me, who have experienced me, remain silent.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not new. It is part of a strange human psychology. The positive
person is humble; even to say something he feels embarrassed, because he
knows that whatever he is going to say is not going to be up to the
experience that he had. It is going to fall very short; hence the
embarrassment.</p><p><br></p><p>But the negative person has no fear, no embarrassment. He has not
experienced anything. And to deny or to lie, or to create a fiction, is
sensational. The people who have been writing against me</p><p>... all the publishers are eager to publish their books – without
knowing what they are writing, all kinds of rubbish. And a few of my
sannyasins who have been with me from the very beginning have written
books just to answer those lies and allegations, with facts and figures,
with solid arguments.</p><p><br></p><p>The publishers are not willing to publish them. They say there is no
sensation in it. Lies have sensation; the truth is non-sensational. And
the masses are interested in sensationalism, they are not interested in
knowing the truth. Truth is simple and plain.</p><p><br></p><p>But this situation has to be reversed; there is a limit to
everything. The positive people have to come out in the light, and tell
with emphasis their own experiences and what they understand about me
and my relationship to my people. Unless they come out and do it, they
are in an indirect way</p><p>helping the negative people. Because if those negative people are not
contradicted, it becomes an argument in their favor – why are they not
contradicted?</p><p><br></p><p>So I can understand, Sarito, that you have experiences to express but
it is always bound to be something not absolutely the experience. It is
going to be something far below. But still it will help people to
understand both sides. The negative is articulate, but is meaningless;
it is not going to help anybody. It can only prevent people from coming
to me. And the people who are writing all those negative books and
articles – they cannot help anybody either. So they are really public
enemies.</p><p><br></p><p>The positive person has to come out so the negative people can be
contradicted, and so that those who are in search of truth, in search of
silence and peace, can feel a possibility: if they come here, maybe if
it is happening to other people, it can happen to them also. You will be
opening doors, and you will be giving invitations to new sannyasins, to
new seekers.</p><p><br></p><p>So don’t keep it as a secret. Don’t enjoy it inside yourself; share
it with as many people as possible, with all the news media, so that you
can reach to the farthest corners of the world.</p><p><br></p><p>And the positive person has many problems which the negative does not
have. First, the positive person starts thinking, “Perhaps my silence,
my joy, my bliss, is just imagination.” The negative person has no
problem; he knows exactly that it is imagination, there is no problem
about it! The problem arises only to the positive person – because it is
not imagination.</p><p><br></p><p>Living here for years ... Imagination is a very momentary phenomenon;
you cannot go on living in imagination for twelve years, fifteen years.
It is possible to live in imagination for a few moments – imagination is
not reality; imagination is just like soap bubbles. For a moment they
can shine in the sun, create a rainbow, and then they are gone and all
those rainbows disappear.</p><p><br></p><p>And one thing more you have to understand, for yourself: you cannot
imagine silence; that is not in the nature of things. You can imagine
all kinds of thoughts, but you cannot imagine thoughtlessness. Nobody
has ever been able to do it, it is almost impossible. You cannot imagine
blissfulness. You don’t have any idea, how can you imagine it?
Imagination needs some kind of experience; then you can project it. But
blissfulness you don’t know.</p><p><br></p><p>You can imagine misery perfectly well. You are so deeply rooted in
misery that there is no problem. You know it, you can imagine it, you
can exaggerate it, you can magnify it a thousandfold; it is in your
hands. But blissfulness you don’t know. Anything that you don’t know is
not possible for you to imagine.</p><p><br></p><p>So if you are feeling silence, peace, bliss; if you are feeling
changes happening in you, in your consciousness, it is not
imagination.</p><p><br></p><p>Secondly, you are worried that it may be “some kind of arrogance in
disguise.” One who is aware that his experiences may be some kind of
arrogance, has really gone beyond arrogance, because arrogance never
recognizes itself. The egoist never recognizes that he is egoistic; the
arrogant cannot even think that he is arrogant.</p><p><br></p><p>To be worried that perhaps it may be arrogance is part of humbleness.
Only a humble person becomes concerned that he should not say anything,
he should not do anything that may bring</p><p>arrogance from the back door. He knows the misery of arrogance, he
knows the pain and the anguish of arrogance. He does not want to get
into that trap again. But if you are aware, arrogance cannot come close
to you, just as when you have light in your house, darkness cannot come
in.</p><p><br></p><p>Gautam Buddha used to say, “You should be like a house which has
light inside. When the house, its doors, its windows, are showing light,
thieves don’t come close. But when the house is dark and there is no
light, it is an opportunity for thieves.” And by thieves he means all
that destroys your beauty, your grandeur, all that takes away your
treasures. Arrogance, ego, aggressiveness, superiority, the idea of
being special – all are destroying you and your peace; they are
destroying your nobodiness.</p><p><br></p><p>You cannot imagine nobodiness. It is almost like ... a beggar can
dream of being a king – in fact beggars always dream, and in their
dreams they fulfill the desires which they cannot fulfill in their
actual waking lives. But nobody has ever heard of a king dreaming about
himself being a beggar; that is unknown. Why should one dream of being a
beggar? The hungry person can dream that he has been invited to a royal
party; he can dream about delicious food – he has to, just to hide his
hunger. But the man who is living in the palace and eating delicious
food is not going to dream that he is hungry; that is just illogical,
unpsychological.</p><p><br></p><p>We dream only of things which we don’t have; we imagine things only
which we don’t have. But once you start having real experiences, those
experiences start changing your lifestyle, your responses to situations;
you can start feeling constantly within you a coolness, a grace, a
gratitude towards existence, and out of this peacefulness, silence,
beauty, all your actions arise ... they also have something of it. Your
words come out from the silences of your heart; they also have some
music from their original source.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a well-known fact: a man like Jesus was uneducated, but no
rabbi in the whole history of Judaism, four thousand years – and Jewish
rabbis are great scholars, unparalleled in any other religion – but no
Jewish rabbi has spoken the way an uneducated carpenter’s son, Jesus,
spoke. And he knew nothing of scripture, he knew nothing of the art of
oratory. Even those who were not in agreement with him had to say, “One
thing we cannot deny: nobody has ever spoken the way he speaks.”</p><p><br></p><p>And he is using simple words, ordinary words used by common people,
but on his lips those ordinary words have a changed quality. They are
coming from a depth; they are bringing some fragrance with them, they
are bringing some authority of his experience. The same words are
available ... all the Christian missionaries are repeating the same
words every day. But you don’t feel any impact, you don’t see ... Why
the difference?</p><p><br></p><p>The difference is that Jesus was speaking out of experience, and
these people are speaking only out of their education. For Jesus, it was
his life. For these missionaries, it is their salary; it is their
livelihood, not their life. For Jesus, what he was saying was so
important that he was ready to sacrifice his life, but not to compromise
on any ground. But these missionaries, if somebody gives them a better
salary, will change their religion immediately. These are professionals.
Their words don’t have any depth. Their words are not alive, but
corpses. They look similar, they sound similar, but you can see when you
hear a missionary .…</p><p>One of the most famous missionaries in both parts of the world, East
and West, was Stanley Jones. He used to live for six months in the East
– he had a beautiful ashram in the Himalayas – and for six months he
used to live in the West. I have come across many missionaries, but the
caliber that Stanley Jones had, none of them have had. He was a genius.
But even a genius cannot put life into words that are not his
experience.</p><p><br></p><p>I told him ... because he used to stay very near to where I was a
teacher in the university, and slowly we became very intimate. He was a
sincere man. I said, “There is a difference – you may accept it, you may
not accept it. These are the same words spoken by Jesus, which you speak
every day in your sermons, but something is missing. They sound the
same; they are exactly the same words. And perhaps you are pronouncing
them better than Jesus. He was uneducated, you are a genius” – and he
was one of the best speakers – “and Jesus has nothing as far as the art
of oratory is concerned. But his words had a life, his words had wings;
they reached you as alive beings, not just corpses. Not just stuffed,
dead birds, looking alive.”</p><p><br></p><p>He was silent for a moment and he said, “Perhaps you are right.
Whatever I am saying is my education, is my scholarship, is my lifelong
learning. What Jesus was saying was not his learning; he never went to
any school. What he was saying was his experience; his words were coming
from a living source.”</p><p><br></p><p>The positive person has to become assertive; he has to come into the
light. Otherwise the world is left in the hands of the negative people,
and these negative people are the cause of preventing others from
seeking and searching.</p><p><br></p><p>I have always liked a story by Turgenev – a Russian novelist, one of
the best the world has ever known. If you are going to choose ten great
books, you will have to give one place to Turgenev without fail. Out of
all the literature in all the languages in the world, he may claim more,
but one is absolutely certain. He has written a small story, THE
FOOL.</p><p><br></p><p>In a small village there was a very simple man. His simplicity was
such that he almost looked like a simpleton, and the whole village
condemned him as the idiot. Out of his simplicity he used to do things,
and the cunning people all around condemned him. He became so much
afraid even to say a single word, because whatever he would say, he
would be immediately criticized, condemned. He became afraid of acting,
of doing anything; his life became a hell. And at that time, a mystic
passed through the village. The idiot reached the mystic and told his
tragic story, asking, “You help me do something<span class=s4></span>”</p><p><br></p><p>The mystic said, “Who says you are an idiot? You are a very simple,
innocent being. Out of your innocence you do things which are going to
be against the ideas of the cunning and the clever.</p><p><br></p><p>“You do one thing – I will be coming back on the same route within a
month, so I can check whether it works or not – I will tell you a simple
secret. From tomorrow morning, you become assertive, aggressive:
Somebody says, ‘What a beautiful sunrise’ and you immediately jump in
and tell him, ‘What is there? What beauty are you talking about? What is
beauty? Define it! I have seen many sunrises like this; it is just a
mediocre sunrise – what is special in it? It happens every day.’ And
nobody can define beauty, nobody can prove that the sunrise is
beautiful. There is no argument, there is no way.</p><p>“Somebody is saying, ‘Look at that woman, how beautiful she is!’
Immediately jump in. You just watch, wherever anybody is making a
positive statement about higher values which cannot be proved, you ask
for proof: ‘What do you mean by calling that ordinary woman, who is not
even homely ... what beauty is in her? Where is it? – in her eyes, in
her nose, in her hair? Where is the beauty? You have to clearly define
it, and point to where it is!’” Now, beauty is not something that can be
pinpointed.</p><p><br></p><p>After one month when the mystic returned, the idiot had become by
that time the wisest man in the village. Somebody would say, “That is a
holy book,” and he would immediately ask, “What do you mean by holy, and
what is holy in this book? The paper used is holy, or the ink used is
holy, or the words used are holy? What is holy in it? These are the same
words, the same ink, the same paper used in every book – what makes this
book holy?” And there was no way to prove .…</p><p><br></p><p>And people became absolutely afraid in his presence. They would
tremble, they would not say anything; the situation was completely
reversed.</p><p><br></p><p>Before, he used to be afraid; now he was never afraid. And nobody
even asked a question of him</p><p>... because the mystic had said, “If somebody asks a question, never
answer, but ask a counter- question – because your answer can be
criticized; don’t be caught in that thing. Just ask a counter- question.
Ask, ‘What do you mean by this question? Explain each single word and
its meaning.’ And harass him so much that even an ordinary sentence
becomes a puzzle.”</p><p><br></p><p>The mystic came; the idiot touched his feet and said, “Your strategy
worked. Now I am the wisest man in this village.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “Don’t be worried – continue. You will be the wisest man in
the whole surrounding area, as far as your name can reach! People will
start coming to you just to have your blessings.”</p><p><br></p><p>A small story, but with great significance. It says how even an
idiot, by using negativity, can become wise.</p><p><br></p><p>But that is not true wisdom. True wisdom is always positive. True
wisdom is always arising out of a yes, out of love, out of gratitude
towards existence. True wisdom knows no “no.” It does not have any
contact with negative attitudes and approaches.</p><p><br></p><p>You are perfectly right. Just don’t remain silent. Bring your silence
into songs, bring your experience into expressions. Say to the world
what you have known, without fear.</p><p><br></p><p>The last thing to be remembered:</p><p><br></p><p>The negative person is always restless, because he has nothing; he is
empty, he is angry, he is unfulfilled. Out of his unfulfillment,
angriness, emptiness, he becomes more and more revengeful, violent. The
positive person, the person who has experienced something, becomes calm
and quiet. Naturally, he has no need to assert. He has no need to say
anything; he is so deeply fulfilled that he does not want to waste his
breath unnecessarily fighting. He simply remains settled in his own
center.</p><p>And this settlement becomes more and more and more and more – to a
point that he completely forgets. Not only that he forgets misery, he
forgets blissfulness – he becomes so accustomed to bliss ... he breathes
bliss in and out, day in, day out. It becomes simply his very being; he
forgets that he is blissful, that he is experiencing ecstasy. These are
just as natural to him as breathing or heartbeats.</p><p><br></p><p>Before it happens, you should make an effort – just out of compassion
– to show the way to others. They are all groping in darkness; they want
some door to open. They are tired of their chains and their handcuffs,
and they want somebody to help them to be freed, somebody to say to them
that “Yes, there is freedom.” They have become so suspicious – perhaps
there is nothing like freedom, nothing like blissfulness, nothing like
ecstasy. And these negative people go on telling them that these are all
imaginations, these are all hypnotic trances; these are not realities.
But their innermost beings are thirsty, although their minds are filled
and distracted and corrupted by the negative people.</p><p><br></p><p>Those who experience something that can be a valuable assurance and
encouragement to anybody, anywhere – so that his hope arises again that
some window can be opened, that there are doors which he has missed;
that he has listened to wrong people, that he has been under the impact
of negative darkness and he has not opened his eyes to the positive
light – before you become completely satisfied, you have to help
people.</p><p><br></p><p>You can do it only before you become so settled that you forget at
all that you are blissful. Bliss can be experienced only in contrast to
misery, and if you have been blissful for years, you have forgotten
misery, how it used to be; now bliss has become your only experience.
The gap – when you are dropping the misery and moving towards bliss,
when you have seen the star for the first time – that is the moment when
you should express yourself ... “Nobody needs to be a pessimist, nobody
needs to drop his hopes. I have seen the star.”</p><p><br></p><p>But it has to be done quickly, when you see it. When you become the
star yourself, then it will be too late. You will not be able to say
anything; even the desire to communicate will disappear.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard the pope died, and went to heaven. Saint Peter asked him
whom among the saints he would like to meet. “Saint Mary, the mother of
Jesus Christ,” said the pope.</p><p><br></p><p>Saint Peter leads him into a palatial hall. There in a far corner
sits an old Jewish lady. The pope approaches her reverently, and sinks
to his knees: “Oh, holy mother of God,” he says, “all my life on earth I
have been looking forward to this blessed moment. There is one question
I want to ask you: What was it like to give birth to our Lord Jesus
Christ?” The old lady wags her head and smiles. “Well, actually we
wanted a girl,” she said.</p><p><br></p><p>The mother of Jesus Christ is bound to become accustomed to Jesus
Christ – he is nothing special to her, her own son. She is disappointed,
because they wanted a daughter and they have got a son who is a
troublemaker! Because of him, they are condemned, and because of him, in
their old age they have to go through great anguish and suffering
because he is crucified.</p><p><br></p><p>When all the disciples had escaped, the mother was sitting there
underneath the cross where Jesus was crucified, crying and weeping. And
she must have been thinking it would have been better if a</p><p>girl had been born. A son – and him too, a son who gets crucified in
her old age. And he was so young, only thirty-three. He has given his
parents nothing but anxiety. To the pope it is one thing – Jesus Christ
is God – but to the old Jewish lady, the mother of Jesus, he was just a
troublemaker, unnecessarily disturbing the peace, unnecessarily leaving
them in their old age in immense misery because of the crucifixion.</p><p><br></p><p>If Jesus Christ is born to you, you will become accustomed. If bliss
is born in your being, you will become accustomed. Before you become
accustomed, spread the good news as far and wide as possible. There are
millions of thirsty people – under the impact of negative, sensational,
articulate people, they are suffering in a kind of limbo. They hear only
the negative side of things. Naturally they become suspicious of whether
any positive side exists at all, or if they are unnecessarily running
after shadows and phantoms – because all these clever people are writing
against the possibility.</p><p><br></p><p>For the new humanity, millions of changes are going to happen. One of
the most major changes will be that the positive person has to become
articulate. He has to say to the world what he is experiencing, without
any fear, without any embarrassment, without any suspicions that it may
be imagination. Even if it is imagination, it may do good.</p><p><br></p><p>But it is not imagination. You cannot imagine spiritual experiences;
you don’t have any notion what they are. Unless you know them, there is
no way of imagining them, and when you have known them, there is no
question of imagination.</p><p><br></p><p>The people in the world are in immense need of a few articulate,
positive, assertive individuals. Not only their words will be helpful,
but their presence – because their words can only be supported by their
presence, by their actions, by their responses. There is no other kind
of evidence. If people see that you are really living peace, that your
life is a song of silence and each of your actions shows it, we can
change the whole negative and sick psychology of man.</p><p><br></p><p>Otherwise ... these negative people have been predominant all through
history – because it is very easy to be negative, anybody can do it.
Anybody can say, even to Gautam Buddha, that “Whatever you are saying is
all nonsense.” And even a man like Gautam Buddha cannot produce any
evidence of his enlightenment. If the person is adamant, stubborn,
closed, there is no way.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha can help the person if he is open, vulnerable, receptive,
ready to feel Buddha’s presence, ready to feel his fragrance, ready to
become part of his silence. But most of the people in the world are
living under the impact of negative people. This impact has created such
an unconscious state</p><p>... people go on falling more and more into unconsciousness, into
darkness.</p><p><br></p><p>Sometimes I think that the Eastern idea has some psychological
significance. It may not be true factually and historically, but
psychologically ... nobody has explored the idea. Just as Charles Darwin
proposed the idea of evolution, the East has believed for thousands of
years in a contrary idea of involution, not evolution; that man is not
growing higher, but falling lower; that the first golden age was in the
very beginning.</p><p><br></p><p>It is worth understanding the whole idea as a psychological
interpretation – not as history, not as science, but as psychology.</p><p>The first age, according to the Eastern mystics is called satyuga,
the age of truth, the golden age. In a way we can see that each man
passes through that golden age again when he is a child. When the whole
humanity was in its childhood, then the idea becomes very relevant.
Children have to learn to speak lies; otherwise, they simply speak the
truth, without any learning. Truth is not to be learned, it is just out
of your innocence.</p><p><br></p><p>Lying needs learning, cleverness, cunningness, calculativeness. Truth
needs only innocence.</p><p>So the first age in the Eastern calculation was satyuga, the age of
truth. They have called it “the golden age.” Their description is
tremendously significant. Describing satyuga they say it was like a
table with four legs, absolutely balanced. Satyuga had four legs, which
kept it absolutely balanced. Then things started falling down.</p><p><br></p><p>The theory is exactly against Charles Darwin – I call it
“involution.” One leg dropped. The table became very unbalanced; life
became unbalanced. Things were no longer the same as they had been –
peaceful, silent, tranquil. With three legs, all balance was lost – but
still, the table can be converted into a tripod. A tripod has three
legs; some balance is still possible. This second age is called treta,
because of three legs – treta means three. The English word ‘three’
comes from the Sanskrit root, tre, and treta also comes from the same
root. Life was no longer golden. Innocence was lost – that was the leg
that was missing – people became more clever, more cunning.</p><p><br></p><p>Then as days went by, things went down more. The third age is called
dwapar. One more leg dropped; only two legs remained. All balance was
lost. Dwapar is the same as the English word two. Dwapar comes from the
Sanskrit root, dwa. Dwa has moved through many languages, reaching a few
languages as twa ... and by the time it reached the English language, it
became two. But it is the same word. Life became ugly, more barbarous,
with more exploitation, more negativity.</p><p><br></p><p>And we are in the fourth – one leg has fallen again; now we are
standing only on one leg. The fourth is called kaliyuga, the age of
darkness. And it seems certainly true that we are living in an age of
darkness and unconsciousness. We are preparing for our own suicide –
what more unconsciousness can there be? The future seems to be
absolutely meaningless. It seems that every day the end of life is
coming closer; the night goes on becoming darker and darker.</p><p><br></p><p>Even small children have been found in thousands taking drugs; it is
no longer the new generation, it is no longer young people – school kids
are taking drugs. School kids have been found murdering other children,
school kids have been found raping girls – and not as an exception. In
America they had a survey, and they could not believe ... the government
tried hard to repress it, not to let it be known to the world, but it
leaked out.</p><p><br></p><p>The most advanced nation, most powerful, most scientifically,
technologically advanced, is going through the darkest period in the
whole of human history.</p><p><br></p><p>This unconsciousness can be broken only if the people whose life has
become meditation, whose life has become a pure love, whose life has
become a compassion, start waking up other sleeping people: “It is time
– get ready. As the night becomes darker, the dawn is closer, but if you
go on sleeping, dawn or no dawn, your night continues. Your eyes are
closed, your darkness continues.”</p><p>Otherwise, a new dawn for the whole human race, a new innocence, a
new childhood, a new satyuga – the age of truth – a new golden age is
possible. But the positive people have to take the bold step of
expressing themselves. They have not been doing that for the whole of
history. They have enjoyed their experience, and they have thought their
work was finished.</p><p><br></p><p>I want you to remember always:</p><p><br></p><p>When you have something to share, don’t stop there; share it.
Humanity is in need, as it has never been in need, of people who can
create new hope for a new dawn.</p><p><br></p><p>A Jew comes to an inn, very late at night, and is forced to share a
room with a Russian officer. Not wanting to meet him, he asks the
innkeeper to wake him up very early in the morning because he has to
catch the first train.</p><p><br></p><p>The Jew undresses and goes to bed, and is awakened by the innkeeper
when it is still dark outside. He dresses quickly and goes out, and to
his surprise, all the soldiers salute him. When he mounts the train he
looks at the mirror and realizes he is wearing a uniform. “Damn the
innkeeper,” cries the Jew. “He woke up the wrong man!”</p><p><br></p><p>Okay, Maneesha? Yes, Osho.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part13>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

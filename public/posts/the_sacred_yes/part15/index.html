Individuality is your essential core. Individuality is not your personality. Personality is given to you by the family, the society, culture; individuality is that which you bring into the world – that is your original face. The individuality gets lost in many layers of personality, and a man has many personalities. You have one personality with your father, another with your mother, another still with your wife, another with your child, another with your servant, still another with your boss. You have many personalities, you have many faces, because you need different faces with different people in different situations.\nSo personality is just a changing flux around you. It is like the surface of a lake, continuously wavering, waving, rippling. It is not its depth. It is constantly at the mercy of the winds. The personality lives through the stimulus it gets from the outside; it is a stimulus-response. And people have completely forgotten about their individuality.\nThe whole work of meditation is to help you to recover it, to reclaim it – your original face, your originality, your nature, your essential nature. And that is what god is. God is everyone’s essential core. The personality is Hindu, Mohammedan, Christian, Communist, Fascist, Socialist; the personality is white, black, Chinese, Indian, German. It has so many colours, it comes in all shapes and all sizes.\nBut the individual core is nothing but god... the taste of totality. And it is always there. However many layers there are, they don’t destroy it. Millions of layers can be there but the treasure remains intact. Whenever you start penetrating your layers, whenever you start peeling your onion, one day suddenly you find the essential core. That is freedom, that is bliss, and that is the only way to be really alive, ecstatically alive.\nSannyas is a search into the individual, beyond the personal. The individual is universal.\nAnand means bliss, atita means of the beyond – bliss of the beyond, transcendental bliss. Happiness is of the earth. It is earthly, hence it is momentary. And in the wake of it there is always unhappiness, because the earth exists in a kind of duality. Everything is a dichotomy: light and darkness, happiness-unhappiness, pleasure-pain, life-death.On the visible plane everything is dual, polar,\ndiametrically opposed to something; this is the dialectics of existence. But beyond the duality there is also something transcendental which is one, undivided. That is bliss. It has no opposite to it.\nIt happens only when one has gone beyond happiness and beyond unhappiness. How to go beyond happiness and beyond unhappiness? Everybody wants to go beyond unhappiness but nobody wants to go beyond happiness, and that is the whole crux of the matter. If you don’t want to go beyond happiness you will never be able to go beyond unhappiness; they come together. People want happiness, and just hidden behind it comes unhappiness. And they are always in the same proportion: the more happiness you have, the more unhappiness you will have. They always balance each other. The more you laugh, the more you will have to cry; the more you love, the more you will have to hate. They always balance.\nSo one who really wants to go beyond this continuous conflict of the dual has to see the pint that if you cling to one pole, the other pole is bound to remain there. So don’t cling to either – just become a witness. When happiness comes, witness it. Just be a watcher, unentangled, untouched by it. It is there; take note of it. Say to yourself, ‘Happiness is there but I am not it. I am just the watcher, the mirror that reflects it.’ Don’t get identified with it and that is the secret key.\nSo when unhappiness comes, you use the same key again. Unhappiness is there, take note of it: ‘I am just a mirror reflecting it. I am not it. I cannot be it.’\nWhen one has become a witness to happiness and unhappiness, that witnessing leads to the transcendental. Then one goes beyond the two and becomes one. And that oneness is bliss. And that is the goal of all life: how to go beyond the two, how to go beyond the conflict, how to go beyond this constant division in one’s being. To attain to one is to attain to god. That one is called god, another name for that one.\nDeva means divine, magan means utterly absorbed, intoxicated, drunk – drunk with the divine, intoxicated with the divine, lost in the divine.\nMan can exist in two ways. One is the way of the ego: separate from the whole, defending his own territory constantly, defining himself in separation like an island. But that is the way of misery, the way of anxiety and anguish, because it is absolutely unnatural. Man is not an island; nobody is, nothing is. We are all joined together: it is one universe. That is exactly the meaning of the word ‘universe’; uni means one. It is not a multiverse; it is a universe. We are all one, howsoever separate we appear; that is only an appearance. One should not be deceived by the appearances. We look separate but we are not separate. We cannot be separate; separation is impossible.\nOne tree looks separate from the other tree but they are joined in the same earth, they are joined with the same sun, they are joined with the same air. How can they be separate? They only appear to be, otherwise they exist in the same ocean of life. The ocean may not be so visible, but it is there. If the sun simply disappears tomorrow morning, forgets to rise or changes its route, all life on the earth will immediately cease, immediately. We will not even have time to discuss it. We will not even\nhave time to be aware of what has happened. And it will not only be man who will disappear – the birds, the animals, the insects, the trees, all life will disappear. Life exists as one vibe.\nTo see it and to start living it is sannyas. To start feeling it is sannyas, and that is another way of life, a totally different kind of style. It is not of the ego, it is of unity with the whole. Sannyas is a step beyond the ego into the whole. It is to be drowned into the whole, absorbed, and immediately a great blessing arises. All anxiety disappears. Anxiety is possible only if you are separate. If you are not separate, how can anxiety be there? – there is nobody to be anxious about. And then there is no fear, because you are not there to die.\nIf you are one with the whole then there is no death; the whole never dies. It is only the parts who come and go, it is only the waves who come and go. The ocean remains, abides; it is eternal. And when you are one with the eternal, where is the fear? Where is anxiety? Where is anguish? When you are not separate you don’t have a private goal, hence there is no anxiety of whether you will make it or not. There is nothing to make, nowhere to go. Then one is utterly herenow.\nTo be with the whole is to be herenow. If you are separate you cannot be herenow; you will have to think of tomorrow. You will have to manage, you will have to plan, you will have to project, and, certainly, when you project fear is always lurking. You may be able to manage it; you may not be able to manage it. You are so tiny and the universe is so big; the fight is doomed to fail. You cannot fight with the whole. It is trying to go upstream and wasting your energy.\nThose who know, if you ask them, if you ask the awakened, they will say ‘Drop all fight and go with the wind like a dry leaf, with no private goal of your own. Let the whole decide the goal and wherever it is going it is good.’\nThis relaxation is sannyas... this let-go is sannyas.…\nDeva means divine, sanjayo means victory, but with a special flavour to it – not an ordinary victory. In English there is no equivalent word for it. It can be translated as ‘right victory’.\nThe ordinary victory is always wrong victory, wrong, because it is not really happening; you are only imposing it on the other. It is a coercion, it is violence. The other is silent but will wait for its time. The other is silenced but not won over. The other is not yet a friend... and this is no way to make friends; this is the way to make enemies. Then what is right victory?\nRight victory is totally different. It is out of love, it is through love; it is not coercion on the other. It is not in any way a rape on the other’s being; on the contrary it is a surrender. When a lover surrenders to his beloved or a disciple surrenders to a master or a devotee surrenders to god or a poet surrenders to the beauty of the world, whenever there is that surrender, it is right victory.\nSo right victory is a paradoxical phenomenon. It does not come by becoming victorious; it comes by surrender. To be defeated in love is to be victorious.\nDeva means divine, abhar means gratitude. And gratitude is real prayer. To be grateful is to be prayerful. Prayer is not a demand, it is not a complaint, it is not asking for something, it is not a desire; if it is, it is not prayer. It is just a thankfulness for all that the existence has done, for all that has been given to us.\nEach moment is so precious that it is really impossible to understand how people can remain ungrateful to existence. Each breath is a miracle, and miracles abound. Wherever you look and whatsoever you see is a miracle. The seed becoming a sprout is a miracle. The sun rising in the morning is a miracle. The night full of stars is a miracle. To look into the eyes of another human being is a miracle and there are depths upon depths and you can never come to an end. If you look into the eyes of another human Being you enter into an infinity. Each flower is a miracle and each stone, yet man is insensitive.\nThat insensitivity is what I call irreligiousness. I don’t call the person irreligious who does not go to the church or to the temple. The irreligious person is one who has lost sensitivity, who is no more receptive to the glories of life, who is no more available to the splendours.\nAlbert Einstein is reported to have said as his last words, that the greatest and most profound thing in existence is the feeling of wonder and awe. That’s what the real religious attitude is: the feeling of wonder and awe. And when you feel the wonder of all that is and you are full of awe. prayer arises as a fragrance. with no effort. It arises as gratitude, and in that gratitude god is found.\nGratitude is the beginning of god: you start with gratitude; one day you end in god. Gratitude is the direction of god. One need not believe in god. one can do without believing in god, but one should be sensitive to nature, to all kinds of experiences. One should be like a child – full of wonder and awe. And one should remain alive to this childlike quality so that each moment in life is a surprise. One should never allow oneself to become knowledgeable, because the knowledgeable person loses awe, loses the quality of wonder, becomes insensitive and then is no more grateful.\nAnd the wonder goes on and on, and the splendour goes on and on but there are blind people, millions of them. They have never bowed down to the earth, they have never hugged the earth, they have never kissed the earth, they have never looked at a tree. They have no time. Because of this, humanity has become more and more irreligious. Temples are millions, churches are millions, but it is very rare to find a religious person.\nMy effort here is not to create a temple, not to create a church, not to create a ritual but to create wondering, that great quality of awe, of love, of beauty, and it all leads to gratitude.\n[A sannyasin says: I want to return now to my studio and start painting before my teaching duties take up again.… I have lots of material to work from...\nYou will be able to do it! This is going to be the greatest thing that you have ever done... because I will be in it, part of it!\nAnd you are growing. Growth does not need much work. All that it needs is a kind of let-go, and that is happening. It is let-go that brings grace, it is not human effort. With human effort we can do only mundane things. That which is great always happens; it is never done. It comes, descends; it is not manufactured.\nGrowth is a natural phenomenon... just as trees go on growing. All that is needed is that.Man is\nno more as natural as trees. So many hindrances have been created by the society, so many rocks; the roots cannot move, and many roots have been cut. So all that is needed is to become aware\nof the rocks and just becoming aware of them is enough. They are removed by becoming aware of them, because they are rocks of unawareness. They are not material things, so it is not a question of becoming aware and then removing them. Just in the very act of becoming aware they are removed. They consist of unawareness, so when you become aware they cannot exist; they disappear. And then life becomes a growth. And when life starts growing on its own, there is tremendous joy. And then each moment is unpredictable because you cannot see what is going to happen next moment.\nEven while painting you cannot know what is going to happen next moment.\nYou will be able to know only when it has happened. And then it is not only a surprise to others, it is a surprise to the painter himself, to the poet himself. If the poet is not surprised by his poetry it is ordinary poetry. He has managed it; it has not come from the beyond. If the painter is not ecstatic, surprised, taken aback by his own painting, then it is an ordinary painting; it is not a masterpiece. But when something great happens the painter is as much surprised as anybody else, in fact, more so, because he has been involved in it, it has come through him, and yet it is not his. A hand from the beyond has reached. He was simply available, he was instrumental, a medium.\nAnd whenever art has that quality, of descending ; from the beyond, it is religion, it is mysticism. It is the way that great things have happened in the past, it is how they have always happened. It is not by manipulation. It is by becoming available to god, just becoming available and saying ‘Whatsoever you would like, do with me. I am at your disposal.’\nThat’s what Jesus said at the last moment ‘Let thy kingdom come. Let thy will be done.’ That should be the motto of all painters, all poets, all musicians:\n‘Let thy kingdom come. Let thy will be done. Let me be removed completely. Don’t allow me to stand in your way. Let me be just a passage, empty, a hollow bamboo’ and then the hollow bamboo immediately becomes a flute on his lips!\nMuch is going to happen, and you have come at the right moment. It is always a question of the right moment. Sometimes people come to me when the moment is not right, they are not in the mood to receive me; they will come and they will go. And even if I want to give to them, it is impossible, they will not take it. But you came at the right moment – you have prepared for it your whole life. Now miracles will start happening. And your painting is going to become your meditation. You are going to grow through it, and as you grow, your paintings will grow. And as paintings grow deeper and more profound, you will become deeper and more profound. You are on the right track – just go on moving.\nIt is said that once a man came across Socrates and he asked Socrates ‘I am a stranger in these parts. I want to go to the temple of Delphi. How should I proceed?’ He was not aware that he was talking to Socrates.\nSocrates says ‘Just go on moving exactly in the direction of your nose and you will reach.’ And that’s what I say to you: Just go on moving in the direction of your nose. Your nose is pointing to the right direction, just go on moving and you will reach the temple. The temple is not far away.…\n[A sannyasin man asks about his passivity: Sometimes I feel like it is a very strong female part in me – just wanting to be passive, receptive and not active. But sometimes I just think I’m lazy.…\nOsho checks his energy.]\nGood... perfectly good. It is absolutely right to be feminine. You should feel fortunate, because this is the quality that one needs in the search for god. One can move towards god only in utter passivity. One cannot be aggressive towards god. In the East we have a saying: ‘God is the only male and everybody else is female.’ It is in deep feminine receptivity that god penetrates. So this is the quality of a disciple, of a devotee.\nThe problem is arising because of your Western conditioning. In the West the male ego is praised. To be active is thought to be very valuable. In the East we have learned something more profound. To know the art of inaction is the greatest thing in the East – we call it tao, wu-wei. And this inaction is not lethargy. Much action happens through it, but you are not the doer. The doer is god, you are just a vehicle. So it is not lethargy. Action will be there but it will come through inaction. And you are ready for that jump.\nRather than feeling it as a problem and making it a curse, accept it with joy and gratitude. this is the quality in the East people try to years to attain, and when they attain it they have already arrived; almost half the journey is over. Then the remaining half is to be done by god, not by you. You have taken your step and you are already there where god can immediately penetrate you. All that you need is to drop this male chauvinistic mind and this attitude that one has to be strong.\nThere is a strength in being delicate too, a totally different kind of strength. There is a strength that only a woman can have and no man can ever have; that is the strength of love, softness. Man is like a rock and the woman is like water; hence the beauty of the woman and the roundness and the softness and the vulnerability. It is not an accident that the woman has been chosen by nature to be the mother, because only she is capable of being pregnant, because she is receptive!\nSo don’t be worried about it – it is not a problem at all. It is a blessing and we will use it. And this is the place where it can be used perfectlyBut drop this idea – there is no problem at all. This is the\nway you should be. The way you are is the way you should be.\nTrying to become active and trying to become stronger will be like putting legs on a snake. It is unnecessary, and not only unnecessary, it will hinder the snake moving. The snake is perfectly able to move without legs; legs are not a necessity. You don’t need to be more active. You can simply move as feminine energy. it is beautiful.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3472","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_sacred_yes/part15/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_sacred_yes/>The Sacred Yes</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">15</h1><div class=post-meta>17 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3472 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Sacred_Yes/part15.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part14>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

happiness, and that is the whole crux of the matter. If you don’t want
to go beyond happiness you will never be able to go beyond unhappiness;
they come together. People want happiness, and just hidden behind it
comes unhappiness. And they are always in the same proportion: the more
happiness you have, the more unhappiness you will have. They always
balance each other. The more you laugh, the more you will have to cry;
the more you love, the more you will have to hate. They always
balance.</p><p><br></p><p>So one who really wants to go beyond this continuous conflict of the
dual has to see the pint that if you cling to one pole, the other pole
is bound to remain there. So don’t cling to either – just become a
witness. When happiness comes, witness it. Just be a watcher,
unentangled, untouched by it. It is there; take note of it. Say to
yourself, ‘Happiness is there but I am not it. I am just the watcher,
the mirror that reflects it.’ Don’t get identified with it and that is
the secret key.</p><p><br></p><p>So when unhappiness comes, you use the same key again. Unhappiness is
there, take note of it: ‘I am just a mirror reflecting it. I am not it.
I cannot be it.’</p><p><br></p><p>When one has become a witness to happiness and unhappiness, that
witnessing leads to the transcendental. Then one goes beyond the two and
becomes one. And that oneness is bliss. And that is the goal of all
life: how to go beyond the two, how to go beyond the conflict, how to go
beyond this constant division in one’s being. To attain to one is to
attain to god. That one is called god, another name for that one.</p><p><br></p><p>Deva means divine, magan means utterly absorbed, intoxicated, drunk –
drunk with the divine, intoxicated with the divine, lost in the
divine.</p><p><br></p><p>Man can exist in two ways. One is the way of the ego: separate from
the whole, defending his own territory constantly, defining himself in
separation like an island. But that is the way of misery, the way of
anxiety and anguish, because it is absolutely unnatural. Man is not an
island; nobody is, nothing is. We are all joined together: it is one
universe. That is exactly the meaning of the word ‘universe’; uni means
one. It is not a multiverse; it is a universe. We are all one, howsoever
separate we appear; that is only an appearance. One should not be
deceived by the appearances. We look separate but we are not separate.
We cannot be separate; separation is impossible.</p><p><br></p><p>One tree looks separate from the other tree but they are joined in
the same earth, they are joined with the same sun, they are joined with
the same air. How can they be separate? They only appear to be,
otherwise they exist in the same ocean of life. The ocean may not be so
visible, but it is there. If the sun simply disappears tomorrow morning,
forgets to rise or changes its route, all life on the earth will
immediately cease, immediately. We will not even have time to discuss
it. We will not even</p><p><br></p><p>have time to be aware of what has happened. And it will not only be
man who will disappear – the birds, the animals, the insects, the trees,
all life will disappear. Life exists as one vibe.</p><p><br></p><p>To see it and to start living it is sannyas. To start feeling it is
sannyas, and that is another way of life, a totally different kind of
style. It is not of the ego, it is of unity with the whole. Sannyas is a
step beyond the ego into the whole. It is to be drowned into the whole,
absorbed, and immediately a great blessing arises. All anxiety
disappears. Anxiety is possible only if you are separate. If you are not
separate, how can anxiety be there? – there is nobody to be anxious
about. And then there is no fear, because you are not there to die.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are one with the whole then there is no death; the whole never
dies. It is only the parts who come and go, it is only the waves who
come and go. The ocean remains, abides; it is eternal. And when you are
one with the eternal, where is the fear? Where is anxiety? Where is
anguish? When you are not separate you don’t have a private goal, hence
there is no anxiety of whether you will make it or not. There is nothing
to make, nowhere to go. Then one is utterly herenow.</p><p><br></p><p>To be with the whole is to be herenow. If you are separate you cannot
be herenow; you will have to think of tomorrow. You will have to manage,
you will have to plan, you will have to project, and, certainly, when
you project fear is always lurking. You may be able to manage it; you
may not be able to manage it. You are so tiny and the universe is so
big; the fight is doomed to fail. You cannot fight with the whole. It is
trying to go upstream and wasting your energy.</p><p><br></p><p>Those who know, if you ask them, if you ask the awakened, they will
say ‘Drop all fight and go with the wind like a dry leaf, with no
private goal of your own. Let the whole decide the goal and wherever it
is going it is good.’</p><p><br></p><p>This relaxation is sannyas... this let-go is sannyas.…</p><p><br></p><p>Deva means divine, sanjayo means victory, but with a special flavour
to it – not an ordinary victory. In English there is no equivalent word
for it. It can be translated as ‘right victory’.</p><p><br></p><p>The ordinary victory is always wrong victory, wrong, because it is
not really happening; you are only imposing it on the other. It is a
coercion, it is violence. The other is silent but will wait for its
time. The other is silenced but not won over. The other is not yet a
friend... and this is no way to make friends; this is the way to make
enemies. Then what is right victory?</p><p><br></p><p>Right victory is totally different. It is out of love, it is through
love; it is not coercion on the other. It is not in any way a rape on
the other’s being; on the contrary it is a surrender. When a lover
surrenders to his beloved or a disciple surrenders to a master or a
devotee surrenders to god or a poet surrenders to the beauty of the
world, whenever there is that surrender, it is right victory.</p><p><br></p><p>So right victory is a paradoxical phenomenon. It does not come by
becoming victorious; it comes by surrender. To be defeated in love is to
be victorious.</p><p><br></p><p>Deva means divine, abhar means gratitude. And gratitude is real
prayer. To be grateful is to be prayerful. Prayer is not a demand, it is
not a complaint, it is not asking for something, it is not a desire; if
it is, it is not prayer. It is just a thankfulness for all that the
existence has done, for all that has been given to us.</p><p><br></p><p>Each moment is so precious that it is really impossible to understand
how people can remain ungrateful to existence. Each breath is a miracle,
and miracles abound. Wherever you look and whatsoever you see is a
miracle. The seed becoming a sprout is a miracle. The sun rising in the
morning is a miracle. The night full of stars is a miracle. To look into
the eyes of another human being is a miracle and there are depths upon
depths and you can never come to an end. If you look into the eyes of
another human Being you enter into an infinity. Each flower is a miracle
and each stone, yet man is insensitive.</p><p><br></p><p>That insensitivity is what I call irreligiousness. I don’t call the
person irreligious who does not go to the church or to the temple. The
irreligious person is one who has lost sensitivity, who is no more
receptive to the glories of life, who is no more available to the
splendours.</p><p><br></p><p>Albert Einstein is reported to have said as his last words, that the
greatest and most profound thing in existence is the feeling of wonder
and awe. That’s what the real religious attitude is: the feeling of
wonder and awe. And when you feel the wonder of all that is and you are
full of awe. prayer arises as a fragrance. with no effort. It arises as
gratitude, and in that gratitude god is found.</p><p><br></p><p>Gratitude is the beginning of god: you start with gratitude; one day
you end in god. Gratitude is the direction of god. One need not believe
in god. one can do without believing in god, but one should be sensitive
to nature, to all kinds of experiences. One should be like a child –
full of wonder and awe. And one should remain alive to this childlike
quality so that each moment in life is a surprise. One should never
allow oneself to become knowledgeable, because the knowledgeable person
loses awe, loses the quality of wonder, becomes insensitive and then is
no more grateful.</p><p><br></p><p>And the wonder goes on and on, and the splendour goes on and on but
there are blind people, millions of them. They have never bowed down to
the earth, they have never hugged the earth, they have never kissed the
earth, they have never looked at a tree. They have no time. Because of
this, humanity has become more and more irreligious. Temples are
millions, churches are millions, but it is very rare to find a religious
person.</p><p><br></p><p>My effort here is not to create a temple, not to create a church, not
to create a ritual but to create wondering, that great quality of awe,
of love, of beauty, and it all leads to gratitude.</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin says: I want to return now to my studio and start
painting before my teaching duties take up again.… I have lots of
material to work from...</p><p><br></p><p>You will be able to do it! This is going to be the greatest thing
that you have ever done... because I will be in it, part of it!</p><p><br></p><p>And you are growing. Growth does not need much work. All that it
needs is a kind of let-go, and that is happening. It is let-go that
brings grace, it is not human effort. With human effort we can do only
mundane things. That which is great always happens; it is never done. It
comes, descends; it is not manufactured.</p><p><br></p><p>Growth is a natural phenomenon... just as trees go on growing. All
that is needed is that.<span class=s4></span>Man is</p><p>no more as natural as trees. So many hindrances have been created by
the society, so many rocks; the roots cannot move, and many roots have
been cut. So all that is needed is to become aware</p><p><br></p><p>of the rocks and just becoming aware of them is enough. They are
removed by becoming aware of them, because they are rocks of
unawareness. They are not material things, so it is not a question of
becoming aware and then removing them. Just in the very act of becoming
aware they are removed. They consist of unawareness, so when you become
aware they cannot exist; they disappear. And then life becomes a growth.
And when life starts growing on its own, there is tremendous joy. And
then each moment is unpredictable because you cannot see what is going
to happen next moment.</p><p><br></p><p>Even while painting you cannot know what is going to happen next
moment.</p><p><br></p><p>You will be able to know only when it has happened. And then it is
not only a surprise to others, it is a surprise to the painter himself,
to the poet himself. If the poet is not surprised by his poetry it is
ordinary poetry. He has managed it; it has not come from the beyond. If
the painter is not ecstatic, surprised, taken aback by his own painting,
then it is an ordinary painting; it is not a masterpiece. But when
something great happens the painter is as much surprised as anybody
else, in fact, more so, because he has been involved in it, it has come
through him, and yet it is not his. A hand from the beyond has reached.
He was simply available, he was instrumental, a medium.</p><p><br></p><p>And whenever art has that quality, of descending ; from the beyond,
it is religion, it is mysticism. It is the way that great things have
happened in the past, it is how they have always happened. It is not by
manipulation. It is by becoming available to god, just becoming
available and saying ‘Whatsoever you would like, do with me. I am at
your disposal.’</p><p><br></p><p>That’s what Jesus said at the last moment ‘Let thy kingdom come. Let
thy will be done.’ That should be the motto of all painters, all poets,
all musicians:</p><p><br></p><p>‘Let thy kingdom come. Let thy will be done. Let me be removed
completely. Don’t allow me to stand in your way. Let me be just a
passage, empty, a hollow bamboo’ and then the hollow bamboo immediately
becomes a flute on his lips!</p><p><br></p><p>Much is going to happen, and you have come at the right moment. It is
always a question of the right moment. Sometimes people come to me when
the moment is not right, they are not in the mood to receive me; they
will come and they will go. And even if I want to give to them, it is
impossible, they will not take it. But you came at the right moment –
you have prepared for it your whole life. Now miracles will start
happening. And your painting is going to become your meditation. You are
going to grow through it, and as you grow, your paintings will grow. And
as paintings grow deeper and more profound, you will become deeper and
more profound. You are on the right track – just go on moving.</p><p><br></p><p>It is said that once a man came across Socrates and he asked Socrates
‘I am a stranger in these parts. I want to go to the temple of Delphi.
How should I proceed?’ He was not aware that he was talking to
Socrates.</p><p><br></p><p>Socrates says ‘Just go on moving exactly in the direction of your
nose and you will reach.’ And that’s what I say to you: Just go on
moving in the direction of your nose. Your nose is pointing to the right
direction, just go on moving and you will reach the temple. The temple
is not far away.…</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin man asks about his passivity: Sometimes I feel like it
is a very strong female part in me – just wanting to be passive,
receptive and not active. But sometimes I just think I’m lazy.…</p><p><br></p><p>Osho checks his energy.]</p><p><br></p><p>Good... perfectly good. It is absolutely right to be feminine. You
should feel fortunate, because this is the quality that one needs in the
search for god. One can move towards god only in utter passivity. One
cannot be aggressive towards god. In the East we have a saying: ‘God is
the only male and everybody else is female.’ It is in deep feminine
receptivity that god penetrates. So this is the quality of a disciple,
of a devotee.</p><p><br></p><p>The problem is arising because of your Western conditioning. In the
West the male ego is praised. To be active is thought to be very
valuable. In the East we have learned something more profound. To know
the art of inaction is the greatest thing in the East – we call it tao,
wu-wei. And this inaction is not lethargy. Much action happens through
it, but you are not the doer. The doer is god, you are just a vehicle.
So it is not lethargy. Action will be there but it will come through
inaction. And you are ready for that jump.</p><p><br></p><p>Rather than feeling it as a problem and making it a curse, accept it
with joy and gratitude. this is the quality in the East people try to
years to attain, and when they attain it they have already arrived;
almost half the journey is over. Then the remaining half is to be done
by god, not by you. You have taken your step and you are already there
where god can immediately penetrate you. All that you need is to drop
this male chauvinistic mind and this attitude that one has to be
strong.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a strength in being delicate too, a totally different kind
of strength. There is a strength that only a woman can have and no man
can ever have; that is the strength of love, softness. Man is like a
rock and the woman is like water; hence the beauty of the woman and the
roundness and the softness and the vulnerability. It is not an accident
that the woman has been chosen by nature to be the mother, because only
she is capable of being pregnant, because she is receptive!</p><p><br></p><p>So don’t be worried about it – it is not a problem at all. It is a
blessing and we will use it. And this is the place where it can be used
perfectly<span class=s4></span>But drop this idea – there is no
problem at all. This is the</p><p>way you should be. The way you are is the way you should be.</p><p><br></p><p>Trying to become active and trying to become stronger will be like
putting legs on a snake. It is unnecessary, and not only unnecessary, it
will hinder the snake moving. The snake is perfectly able to move
without legs; legs are not a necessity. You don’t need to be more
active. You can simply move as feminine energy. it is beautiful.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part14>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

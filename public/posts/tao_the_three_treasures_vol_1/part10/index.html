Question 1
DO WISDOM AND UNDERSTANDING INCREASE GRADUALLY OR DO THEY COME AS EXPLOSIONS?
UNDERSTANDING NEVER COMES, neither as a sudden phenomenon nor as a gradual one, because it is always there. You have it right now. It is not going to happen somewhere in the future.

You have it right now. It is not going to happen somewhere in the future. You are carrying it within you, just as a seed carries the tree, a woman carries a child. You are carrying it right now. Now it depends on you: if your intensity is total you will achieve it suddenly, if your intensity is not total you will achieve it by and by, in steps. But understanding never comes to you – you are understanding. Enlightenment is not something that happens to you – you are enlightenment.\nRemember this; then it is a choice, your choice. If you desire it totally, in that fire of total desire all that covers that understanding burns; suddenly the light is there. But it is up to you. It is not part of the nature of enlightenment to happen gradually or to happen suddenly.\nDon’t throw off the responsibility, that’s how people create philosophies and schools. In Japan two schools of Zen exist: one believes in sudden enlightenment, another believes in gradual enlightenment – as if these are the qualities of enlightenment, as if they belong to enlightenment. They don’t belong to enlightenment. Enlightenment is always there; it is for you to choose. If your\ndesire is total not even a single moment is lost. But if your desire is not total it means that you yourself are not willing it to happen right now. You want to postpone it, you want it tomorrow, some other day. Then you go on playing tricks.\nIf you are really sincere there is no time gap, it can happen this very moment. Not even a single moment is to be lost, because it is already the case. One has just to look within. But if you don’t want it right now then you can wait for millennia.\nI would like to tell you an old story. It happened in Ceylon.\nThere was a great Buddhist Master who taught his disciples for almost eighty years. When he was a hundred and twenty he said one day, “Now, I am going to die after seven days.” So thousands of his disciples gathered for his last darshan, to see him for the last time.\nThe old man, before closing his eyes and dissolving withinwards, asked them, “Does somebody want to accompany me? If somebody wants nirvana, enlightenment, right now, then he should simply raise his hand and that will do.”\nPeople knew that he was a man of his word, and he was not joking. He had never joked in his whole life, he was a serious man. He meant what he said. They started looking at each other – thousands of people and not a single hand was raised.\nOne man stood up and he said, “Please don’t misunderstand me. I don’t want to accompany you right now because there are many things to be done. I have many things to fulfill, many things to pass through, many karmas to be accounted for. As yet I am not ready for it, but someday I would like to be enlightened. Can you give some key hints? – because you will be no longer here.”\nAnd the Master had been giving key hints his whole life, for eighty years. Still they wanted something to be said about it so that they could postpone and plan and think about the future. And the old Master was ready. If somebody had been ready he was ready to take him with himself. But nobody was ready.\nPeople are cunning, because the mind is cunning. And the greatest cunningness of the mind is that it always throws responsibility onto something else. If enlightenment is gradual then what can you do? Nothing can be done; it is gradual, it will take a long time. If enlightenment is sudden then why has it not happened to you? You will ask, “Then why has it not happened to me if it is sudden? No, it cannot be sudden. But if it is sudden and there is no need to do something for it to happen, then what can be done? I will wait – whenever it happens it happens.”\nYou simply want to escape from the responsibility of your own choice. Sartre has said one thing that is really beautiful. He said, “Man is free to choose but man is not free not to choose.” You can choose either way but don’t be befooled – you have no freedom not to choose, because even when you think you are not choosing you are choosing the opposite.\nA man came to me and he said, “I am not yet ready for sannyas. I am ready seventy per cent, eighty per cent, but twenty per cent I am not ready, so how can I take sannyas? I’m not total.”\nSo I said, “Okay. But still you are choosing, and now you are choosing a minor part of your mind – the twenty per cent which says, ‘Don’t take.’ Now you are choosing the twenty per cent against the eighty per cent.”\nSo don’t think that you are not choosing. That’s not possible. You have to choose whatsoever you do; even if you don’t choose you will be choosing. Choice is there. One is free to choose but one is not free not to choose. If the mind says it is gradual, it is a choice; if the mind says it is sudden, that too is a choice. When you say it is sudden it means that you would like to drop every effort, so you choose sudden enlightenment. Then there is no need to do anything – when it happens it happens, nothing can be done because it is a sudden thing. Just like lightning in the sky, whenever it happens it happens – you cannot make preparations for it. It is not like electricity in the house that you put on and off, it does not depend on you. It is a sudden phenomenon, when it happens it happens. You have to wait for it. If you are thinking about reading a telegram when the electricity happens in the sky, then you have to wait. When it happens you can read it. What can you do?\nPeople who want to escape from effort will choose sudden enlightenment. People who want to escape from the great, total responsibility of it, that it can happen right now, will choose the philosophy of gradualness.\nI don’t say anything about enlightenment – I’m saying something about you. It is for you to feel your desire: total desire – enlightenment is sudden, partial desire – enlightenment is gradual. It has nothing to do with the nature of enlightenment. Remember this.\nThe second question:\nQuestion 2\nDO TAOISTS AGREE WITH THE HAPPENING OF SUDDEN ENLIGHTENMENT OR THE GRADUAL ONE?\nTHEY DON’T BOTHER. Lao Tzu does not bother, because he says: Just to be ordinary is to be enlightened. It is not something special that one has to achieve, it is not an achievement, it is not something that one has to reach. It is you – in your absolute ordinariness it flowers. To be extraordinary is the disease of the ego.\nThe ego always wants to be extraordinary, someone special, unique, incomparable – that is the hankering desire of the ego. If you can become a Rockefeller, good; if you can become a Hitler, good; or if you cannot become a Rockefeller or a Hitler, then renounce the world and think of becoming a Buddha. But become someone, someone special, a historic phenomenon.\nLao Tzu is not bothered about enlightenment and all that nonsense. He says: Just be ordinary. Eat when you feel hungry, drink when you feel thirsty and go to sleep when sleep comes. Just be as natural as the whole existence, and suddenly there is everything in all its glory. Nothing is needed.\nTo be ordinary is the most extraordinary state of being because the ego dissolves. The ego is subtle. You get rid of it in one direction, it comes from another. You push it out from one door, go inside the room and it is sitting on the throne – it has entered from another door. Before you even come in it is already there.\nI had a friend who had a small cat, a very beautiful cat. He asked me what name he should give to the cat. I called the cat “Ego” because the ego is very cunning and a cat of course is cunning. There is nothing like a cat for cunningness. So he named his cat “Ego.”\nBut by and by he got fed up. He was a lonely man, a bachelor with no wife, no children, and he wanted always to be alone but the cat was a continuous disturbance. He would be sleeping and she would jump on his chest. And she would come in with bloodmarks on her paws and destroy a whole chair-seat or his clothes, because she was continuously hunting mice. So she was a trouble to him, and for a bachelor who had never cared for anybody, she was too much of a wife. He asked me what to do. This Ego had become a trouble. So I told him, “Ego is always a trouble. You go and throw it out.”\nHe said, “But she knows all the ways of the town. She will come back.” I told him, “You go to the forest.”\nSo he went to the forest so that the cat could not find the way home. He went in and in – and then lost the way! Then there was only one thing to do: he let the cat go, followed her, and came back home. That was the only way, there was nobody else to ask. The cat came back as certain as an arrow, not even hesitating for a single moment which way to follow.\nSo I told him, “Your cat has the quality of the ego perfectly. You cannot throw it out easily. Wherever you go to throw it, when you come home, it is already there. Or sometimes you may get lost and then you will have to follow it, because only it knows the way.”\nThe ego is very wise – wise in its cunningness. Lao Tzu does not give the ego any foothold, any ground to stand on, so he does not talk about enlightenment. So if you meet Lao Tzu don’t ask him, “Do you believe in sudden enlightenment or in gradual enlightenment?” He will not answer you. He will laugh at you: What foolishness! There is no need for any enlightenment. That word doesn’t occur for Lao Tzu, it is not part of his vocabulary.\nHe is very simple. He says: Just be ordinary. Why this hankering to be extraordinary, to be someone? And if you cannot be someone in the world then become enlightened at least. But why? Why can’t you be satisfied and content with yourself as you are? If you ask me, to be content with oneself as one is is enlightenment. It is nothing special, as yogis have made it sound: kundalini rising, light showing, inner experiences, angels and God and this and that. This is all nonsense if you understand it. Enlightenment is nothing of this sort.\nAll these things – kundalini and the light and God and angels and heaven and hell – are part of the magician’s bag. You want them – he immediately produces, supplies them. You create the demand and the magician supplies the things to you. You want something special, he gives it to you. He exploits you. He lives on your absurd desires.\nLao Tzu is absolutely simple. He has no bag. He says: Why not just be? What is wrong? What is wrong in that which you are? Why make an effort? And who will make the effort? You will make the effort. Your effort cannot go beyond you, and whatsoever you do, you will do. How can it go beyond you? How can it be transcendental? By your own efforts how can you transcend? It is not possible;\nyou are trying to do the impossible. You can go on jumping for thousands of lives and nothing will be attained.\nAccept yourself. That is the only reality there is, that is the only possibility there is. Accept yourself as you are and suddenly everything is transformed. Acceptance is the word for Lao Tzu, not enlightenment – total acceptance, whatsoever the case is. Nothing else is possible.\nThis is how things are. This is how you have happened into this vast universe. This vast universe wanted you to be like this – now you accept.\nThere are only two choices available: either you reject yourself or you accept yourself. If you reject then there are again two possibilities open: you reject in a wordly way or you reject in an other- worldly way. If you reject yourself in a worldly way it means that you would like to be more beautiful than you are, you would like to be more strong than you are, you would like to be more rich than you are, you would like to have a bigger house than you have. This is to reject in a worldly way. If you reject yourself in an other-worldly way, the religious way, it means that you would like to attain satori, samadhi, enlightenment, nirvana; you would like to become a Buddha; you would like to possess God; you would like to live in infinite bliss. This is how you reject in a religious way. These are both rejections and both are wrong. For Lao Tzu both are equally absurd.\nYour marketplace is a marketplace; your temple is also part of it. Your this-worldly desires are worldly desires; your other-worldly desires are also desires and worldly. In fact there cannot be any other-worldly desire. Desire itself is this-worldly. Desire means this world.\nI would like to tell you an anecdote.\nIt happened in a Sufi’s life. A great mystic, living silently by himself, one day was suddenly awakened by a messenger from God.\nThe messenger said, “Your prayers have been accepted. Now the Supreme Being, the Creator, is very happy with you. You can ask, and whatsoever you desire will be fulfilled. You ask and immediately it will be fulfilled.”\nThe mystic was a little puzzled and he said, “You came a little late. When I needed things, when I had many desires, you never came. Now I have no desires, I have accepted myself, I am totally at ease, at home. Now I don’t bother even whether God exists or not, I don’t pray to him. I pray because it feels good. I have stopped thinking about him at all. My prayer is not addressed to anybody anymore; I simply pray as I breathe. It’s so beautiful whether God exists or not is irrelevant. You came a little late. Now I have no desire.”\nBut the angel said, “This will be an offense against God. When he says you can ask, you have to ask.”\nThe man was puzzled, he shrugged his shoulders and said, “But what to ask? Can you suggest anything? – because I have accepted everything and I am so fulfilled. At the most you go and tell God that I’m grateful. Give my thanks to him. Everything is as it should be. Nothing is lacking, everything is perfect. I am happy, blissful, and I don’t know anything about the next moment. This moment is all, I am fulfilled. You go and give my thanks.”\nBut the angel was stubborn. He said, “No, you will have to ask something – just as a mannerism. Be a little understanding.”\nThen the man said, “If you insist, then ask God to keep me as desireless as I am. Give me only one thing – desirelessness...”\n... or acceptability, they both mean the same thing.\nDesire means rejection of something – you would like to be something else; desirelessness means acceptance – you are happy as things are. In fact, things are irrelevant, you are happy. You are happy, that’s the point. Lao Tzu says: Be content as you are, nothing else is needed – and then suddenly everything happens. In deep acceptance the ego disappears.\nEgo exists through rejection: whenever you reject something ego exists. Whenever you say no ego is strengthened, but whenever you say yes, a total yes to existence, that is the greatest meditation you can enter into. In all other meditations you can enter but you will have to come out. This is the only meditation in which you enter and you cannot come out, because once you enter you are no more. Nobody can come out of it.\nThe third question:\nQuestion 3\nYOU HAVE SAID THAT ANY QUESTION IS VIOLENT, YET WE ARE ENCOURAGED TO ASK QUESTIONS. WHY IS THIS?\nBECAUSE YOU ARE VIOLENT and you need catharsis. You have questions to ask; you may not have the courage to ask them, that’s why you are encouraged. You have questions to ask; you have to pass through that. Ask them. I’m not saying that my answers will destroy them – no. My answers are not pointed that way. My answers have a totally different purpose. They will make you aware that all questions are useless, futile, absurd.\nI would like you to come to a point where the mind stops questioning, but that you cannot do because you are full of questions. Release them, don’t suppress them. Be courageous. Even if you know that they are foolish, don’t hide them, because if you hide them you will never be able to get rid of them. Even if they are ridiculous – and all questions are – ask.\nAnd I’m not really answering your questions. Your questions cannot be answered. Your questions are like a person who is in a delirium, whose fever has gone very high. He is reaching one hundred eight, one hundred nine, one hundred ten... and he is in delirium. Then he says, “Everything is moving, the table is flying in the sky.” And he asks, “Where is this table going?” What to say to him? Whatsoever you say will be wrong, because the table is not going at all. And you cannot convince the man that the table is not going anywhere, it is just in the room, not moving at all. That will not convince him because you cannot convince anybody against his own experience.\nHow can you convince anybody against his own experience? Conviction is possible when his own experience supports it, otherwise not. He is seeing that the table is flying trying to get out of the\nwindow, that the table has wings – and not only the table, the cot he is lying on, that too is jumping and getting ready, getting ready to take off.… How can you convince a man who is in a delirium? If you try to convince him you are also mad. Only a mad doctor will try to convince. No, the doctor will say, “You don’t be worried, the table will come back. We will bring it back, don’t be worried. We will do something.” The doctor will try to bring his temperature down; when the temperature comes down the table will come down by itself. When the temperature becomes normal the table is in its place. It has always been there – it has not moved a single inch.\nThat is the situation. I see, I know, that you are in a delirium. And this delirium is very subtle – no temperature measuring device can measure it, it is an inner, not a physical temperature. Inside you are in a delirium. Then questions and questions and questions – like flies they go on and on. I help you to ask and even encourage you to ask, just to get rid of them. This is a catharsis, this is part of a meditation.\nListening to me, by and by you will come to a point where you will understand that all questions are futile, in fact questioning is useless. When this realization arises in you you will have a total change of attitude. Then questions disappear. When all questions disappear, the answer arises. And remember well, there are not as many answers as there are questions, there is only one answer to all questions. Questions may be millions – the answer is one. There is only one answer, the answer, and that is self-knowledge. So I am helping you to become aware.\nThere is a Sufi story:\nA few men were passing by a Sufi monastery; just curious, they came to see what was happening there. People were in catharsis, freaking out, screaming, jumping, going completely mad. The travelers thought, “This is a mad monastery. We always thought that people come to attain enlightenment here but these people have gone mad.” And the Master was sitting amidst this catharsis, this mad chaos all around him. In the midst of it he was sitting silently.\nThe travelers thought, “Why is the Master sitting silently?” Someone from the group suggested that maybe he was too tired, he may have done this madness too much.\nThen after a few months they were coming back to their town after their work was done, and again they passed the monastery. They again looked to see what had happened to those mad people. But now everybody was sitting silently, not even a single word. When they approached the monastery they became afraid: had those people left? – because there seemed to be nobody now. When they came in everybody was there but they were silently sitting.\nThen after a few months they went again on another business journey. Curiosity led them again to the monastery. They looked, there was nobody. Only the Master was sitting there. So they asked, “What is all this?”\nThe Master said, “When you passed through the first time you saw the beginners. They were full of madness and I encouraged them to bring it out. The next time you passed they had realized, they had calmed down. That’s why they were sitting silently. There was nothing to do. When you passed by the third time there was no need even to be here. Now they can be silent anywhere in the world, so I have sent them back to the world. I am waiting for a new group. When you pass next time, again there will be madness.”\nI encourage you to ask – it is to bring your mind out. This will help you to calm down. My answering in fact is not any effort to answer your questions, it is an effort to kill them, to murder them. I am not a teacher. I may be a murderer but I am not a teacher. I am not teaching you anything, I am simply destroying your questions. Once all questions are destroyed your head is cut off – I have murdered you. Then you are completely silent, content, absolutely at home. No problem exists – you live life moment to moment, you enjoy, you delight in it moment to moment. No problem exists.\nI am against metaphysics but I have to talk about metaphysics. My whole work is therapeutic. I am not a metaphysician. My work is like this: you have a thorn in your foot; I bring another thorn to take the first thorn out of your foot. The first thorn and the second thorn are similar, there exists no qualitative difference. When the first is out, helped by the second, we throw away both.\nWhen I bring your questions out I’m not saying put my answers in the places left vacant by the questions – no. Throw away my answers also, as you throw away your questions; otherwise my answers will create troubles for you. Don’t carry my answers, they are only therapeutic. They are like thorns: they can be used to bring other thorns out, then both have to be thrown away.\nThe fourth question:\nQuestion 4\nWERNER ERHARD, A WESTERN YOGI, SAYS THAT PROBLEMS THAT YOU HAVE BEEN TRYING TO CHANGE OR PUT UP WITH CLEAR UP IN THE PROCESS OF LIFE ITSELF. HOW DOES THIS RELATE TO MEDITATION? ARE THE TWO INCOMPATIBLE?\nERHARD IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT, but you can misunderstand him because whatsoever he is saying is as profound as anything that Lao Tzu can say. You can misunderstand him.\nTry to understand it. Profundities are dangerous, and listened to by ignorant people they can become very very dangerous. Joined with your stupidity, a profundity can become a very great fall.\nYes, this is absolutely right: problems that you have been trying to change or put up with clear up in the process of life itself – that’s true, a statement of fact, it happens that way. But then the problem arises whether meditation is compatible with it or not. Now your stupidity has come in.\nMeditation is also part of life – you have to do it as you have to do many other things. Why take meditation as something which is not part of life? Meditation is part of life, you have to pass through it too. You have come to meditation because something in you needed it, otherwise why should you come? The whole world has not come to me, only a few people have come to me. I am as available to them as I am available to you. Even people who live in Poona have not come, and you may have crossed oceans.\nThere is something in you, a deep desire for it.Sex alone is not life, food alone is not life. Meditation\nis as much life as anything else, and it is your part in life to pass through it.\nNow, what Erhard says is absolutely true, a statement of fact. Nothing else is needed, one needs only to live and everything settles by itself. But meditation is also part of life, yoga is also part of\nlife, one has to pass through it. You cannot escape it. If you try to escape it, that part which you have not fulfilled will always remain hanging over you and you will feel that something has remained incomplete.\nBe courageous and don’t escape from anywhere. Wherever your inner life leads you, go! Don’t bother where it leads you. Sometimes it will lead you astray, that I know, but to go astray is also part of life. Nobody can always be right, and people who try always to be right die almost absolute failures. Don’t be bothered that you may go astray, if life leads you astray, go! Go happily! The energy that leads you astray will bring you back. That sojourn may be a part of the final growth.\nThis is my experience: that in the end one finds that everything fits together. Everything that you did, good and bad, right and wrong, moral and immoral – whatsoever you did, in the end one finds life is really wonderful, everything fits. If you look back you would not like to change anything, because if you change even a part then the whole would be changed.\nThis is what acceptance is. This is what the Hindu attitude about fate or the Mohammedan attitude about kismet is. The attitude is very simple, only this: whatsoever happens, take it as part of your destiny. Move into it. Don’t withhold yourself.\nIf you have to err, err – but err totally. If you have to fall, fall – but fall like a drunkard, completely. Don’t resist, because then you miss. If you have to live in darkness, live in darkness – but happily and dancingly. Why be miserable? If you are feeling hell around you, feel it – it may be part of your destiny, part of your growth.\nOf course I know that when one passes through hell, it is very difficult. That I know. Because growth is difficult. When one passes through a problem, a heart-rending problem, a crisis, one wants to escape; one wants not to face it; one wants to be a coward. But that way you will miss something that was going to become a part of the final whole, of the final harmony. If you have lived totally... I don’t make any conditions. I say live unconditionally. If your inner voice tells you to meditate, meditate. If your inner voice tells you to go and drink, then drink and be a drunkard. But be total, because only through totality does one transcend. Only through totality is one transformed because only through totality does one start understanding what one is doing.\nPeople come to me and they say that they have much anger in them and they would like not to have it any more. They have had enough of it and they have suffered much for it. Their whole life has become miserable. And they repent much, whenever they become angry they repent much. They try again and again not to be angry, they decide not to be angry, they put all their willpower into it, but after a few hours they have forgotten. Again something happens, a situation occurs, and they are angry. So what to do?\nI tell them: Don’t repent. Begin from there. Don’t repent, at least that much you can do. Be angry and be totally angry and don’t repent. And don’t feel sorry about it. You have been angry, accept the fact that you are a man with an angry nature. Okay. Be totally angry. Because that repentance is not allowing you to be totally angry, something is being withheld. That part which remains inside and has not been expressed becomes poisonous, a canceric growth. It will color all your life, the whole of your life. Be angry, and when you are angry let the phenomenon be such that you can say, “I am anger, not angry.” Nobody is left behind to look at it – you are anger. It will become a fire, a hellfire.\nIt will be great suffering but it has to be so. It may be that if you can be really in a hellfire only once you will become so alert about it that there will be no need to decide against it. The very experience will have decided everything – you will never go near it again. Not that you take a vow against it, not that you go to the church and confess and repent.… People start enjoying that too; they start indulging in repentance also.\nI have heard that a woman came for the seventh time to the Father in the church to confess a sin. Even the Father was a little surprised because it was the same sin again and again – that she had made love to a man to whom she was not married.\nSo the Father said, “Have you committed the sin seven times or only once?” She said, “Only once.”\nSo he said, “Then why do you go on confessing it? You have already confessed seven times.” She said, “I love to talk about it. It’s so beautiful just to think about it.”\nEven in imagination, confessing to a Father.…\nPeople start indulging in their repentance, confessions. They may even exaggerate – this has been my feeling. Saint Augustine’s book CONFESSIONS seems to be an exaggeration; he seems to be indulging in it. The very idea of committing so many sins seems to be appealing. In India, Gandhi’s autobiography seems to be an exaggeration. He goes on talking and talking about his sins, it seems he is enjoying it. And now psychologists say that there are people who exaggerate their sins because then, against that background, they become great saints. Because they have not left ordinary sins, they were such great sinners, and now they have become such great saints! The distance is vast and the revolution great.\nOnly a great sinner can be a great saint. How can an ordinary sinner be? You smoke a cigarette – do you think you can become an Augustine or a Gandhi just because you smoked a cigarette once, or you looked at a woman and a lust arose in you, that’s all? That won’t do, it is not enough material. You cannot create a big saint out of small sins, you have to be a great sinner.\nSo people who write their autobiographies should never be believed. I must have read thousands of autobiographies but this is my observation: that there exists no other sort of fiction which is more fictitious. Autobiography is the greatest fiction. All autobiographies are fictitious. Either one goes on praising himself or one goes on condemning himself, but both are untrue because in both ways one starts becoming extraordinary. The ego cannot be fulfilled by just being ordinary.\nSomebody asked Rinzai, “What do you do? What is your practice, what is your SADHANA?”\nAnd he said such a simple thing – how could you make an autobiography out of it? He said, “When I feel hungry I eat, and when I feel sleepy I go to sleep, that’s all.”\nHow can you make an autobiography out of it? And Rinzai would not look like a great saint either. What type of a saint would this be?\nAfter Rinzai died, his disciple was lecturing in a monastery. A man belonging to the opposite sect stood up; he was feeling very jealous because so many people had come to listen.\nSo he stood up and he said, “One question, sir. You are talking too much about your Master. But mine is a real Master, he can do thousands of miracles. I have seen with my own eyes: he was standing on one bank of the river, and it was the time of rains and the river was flooded. And on the other bank a disciple was standing with a copy-book in his hand. On one bank my Master wrote with a pencil and it was written on the disciple’s copy-book on the other bank. Can you say anything about your Master, what miracles he did?”\nThe disciple said, “I know only of one miracle that my Master used to do – every day, every minute Silence fell all over the hall. People became curious: what miracle had Rinzai done?\nThe disciple said, “When he felt hungry he ate and when he felt sleepy he slept. That’s the only miracle that he did.”\nYou will not think it much of a miracle but it is. It is a very profound phenomenon. It means to be natural completely. You are almost fighting. When you feel hungry you don’t eat because a thousand and one other things have to be done; when you don’t feel hungry you eat because now is the time to eat. When you feel sleepy you avoid it because there is a dance worth going to, or a movie worth seeing. When you feel sleepy you are sitting in the movie. When you don’t feel sleepy, because the movie has excited you too much, now you try to go to sleep and you have to take tranquilizers.\nTo be unnatural has become our natural life. Of course to be natural is a miracle, the greatest miracle: just to delight in ordinary things, in eating, sleeping, drinking, the breeze that passes you.… Enjoying ordinary things, delighting in them, the whole of life becomes a celebration.\nErhard is right. He is saying a Lao Tzuan thing: “Problems that you have been trying to change or put up with clear up in the process of life itself.” Live life, live in its totality, move in all its dimensions – indulge in every dimension, indulge totally, and in the end you will find that everything helped. Everything, I say: even the wife who created so much misery for you, even that; even the child that you loved so much and died early, even that; even the business that failed and you became broke, yes, even that. Everything! Failure and success, pain and pleasure, right and wrong, going astray and coming back home – everything helps.\nAnd out of this chaos arises a harmony. But one has to live it totally. I am not saying that everyone reaches to that harmony. No, that is a possibility. One can reach, one may miss, and people who miss are those people who try hard to reach it. People who attain to it are people who don’t bother much about attaining it, they simply live moment to moment.\nThat final harmony, that crescendo, is a cumulative effect. So enjoy wherever you are, be grateful, whatever you have. Feel deep gratitude – let that be your only prayer. Go totally wherever you go. If you go to a prostitute, go totally... and I know that even to your wife you have not gone totally. If you drink wine, drink it totally... and I know you have not even drunk water totally.\nThis incomplete life cannot become a crescendo; this life lived always incomplete, fragmentary, cannot create a harmony. You will die a chaos – that’s why you will die always afraid of death.\nAnd when death knocks at your door you will tremble – because the life harmony has not yet been achieved, and death has come. You have not lived life, and death has come. You are as yet incomplete, in fact unborn, and death has come. You tremble.\nA man who has lived his life, one who has lived his day, always accepts death beautifully, because there is nothing left to be done any more. He has done all, he has lived all and he moved in all directions. All that life could give he had accumulated in him. He has accumulated the honey of life, now he is ready to die. There is nothing else.\nDo you know? – for one spoonful of honey a bee has to visit five thousand flowers – for one spoonful of honey five thousand flowers! And for one pound of honey – scientists have measured – they say thousands of miles have to be traveled by bees. One spoonful of honey five thousand flowers! One spoonful of harmony and five thousand experiences, thousands and thousands of experiences.…\nAnd remember only one thing: wherever you are be totally there, otherwise you will visit the flower and you will come away without the honey. That is the only misery that can happen to a man and that happens to almost ninety-nine per cent of people. You are in such a hurry – just think of a bee in such a hurry that she goes to the flower but never touches it because she is in such a hurry to go to another flower. Incomplete, she moves to another flower but by the time she has reached the other flower the idea is hankering in her mind to go to another. She visits five thousand or five million flowers and comes back empty-handed. Don’t be that type of bee! When you visit a flower, really visit it. Forget about all other flowers in the world – there exist no others at that moment. Just be a bee – hum and delight and enjoy the flower. Be with it as totally as possible. Then you accumulate life’s honey and when you die you die blissfully, ecstatically. You lived. There is no complaint in your heart, no grudge. And I tell you that if you have lived all moments in their totality, in awareness, at the moment of death you can bless all – your friends and your enemies. Yes, your enemies also, because without them you would not have been able to reach to this crescendo. They were part, part of a mysterious phenomenon that is life.\nThe fifth question:\nQuestion 5\nYOU ONCE SAID THAT IN THE QUESTION LIES THE ANSWER SO THE NATURE OF THE QUESTION DETERMINES THE NATURE OF THE ANSWER. WHAT IS THEN THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION THE MIND CAN ASK?\nTHE MIND CAN never ask any fundamental question because whatsoever the mind asks is bound to be superficial. When the question arises out of your being, not out of your mind, it will not be verbal, it will be existential. You will be the question – then it is fundamental.\nA Sufi mystic used to come to the mosque every day and he would stand there not saying a single word, for years and years. People became curious.\nSomebody asked, “You never say anything, we have not even seen your lips quivering a little and we have watched you, observed you closely. We don’t feel that even inside you are saying anything, you stand there like a rock. What type of prayer is this?”\nThe mystic said, “Once it happened that a beggar was standing before a palace of an emperor. The emperor came out, looked at the beggar and said, ‘What do you ask? What do you want?’ The beggar said, ‘If by looking at me you cannot understand, then there is no need to say. I will go to another house. Look at me – naked in the cold winter, shivering. Look at my belly – it has joined the back. Look at my limbs – all the flesh has disappeared. I am a skeleton and you ask what do I want? Is my being here not enough?’ The king became afraid, the beggar was right. Much was given to him.”\nAnd the mystic said, “I was passing by on the road. From that day I stopped praying, because what to say to the emperor of the world? Can’t he understand what misery I am in? Have I to say it? Assert it? Have I to be articulate with him? If he cannot understand my being, what use will it be to talk? Then it is useless: if he cannot understand my being he cannot understand my language. Silent is my prayer, unquestioned is my question, undesired is my desire. It is me, it is my total being.”\nThat is fundamental, that is foundational, that is radical – it comes from the very roots. The word radical comes from “roots.” A radical, a foundational, a fundamental question is never asked by the mind. The mind cannot ask it; the mind is impotent about it. The mind is just like the waves on the ocean. Can you ask me which wave is the deepest? No wave is, no wave can be, because waves can exist only on the surface, they cannot be in the depth. In the depth there are no waves.\nThe mind is the surface, the waves. All questions raised by the mind are superficial. The fundamental question is asked when the mind has been dropped. It is a no-mind question, it is a being question. Then you stand with a question not even verbalized within you, because who will verbalize it? The mind has been put aside, your whole existence is a question mark.\nAnd when that fundamental question is asked only then can the Master give you himself in his totality. He can pour himself into your being. When you ask a superficial question, of course a fundamental answer cannot be given, because it will fall on deaf ears, on dead hearts. When you ask a question the quality of the answer is already decided in it.\nThe sixth question:\nQuestion 6\nYOU CALLED US THE “ANCIENT ONES.” IF WE HAVE BEEN WITH OTHER MASTERS IN PAST LIVES, HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT WE COULD HAVE MISSED THEM SO CONSISTENTLY?\nBECAUSE YOU ARE very consistent. Be a little inconsistent, otherwise you will miss me also. The seventh question:\nQuestion 7\nYOU SAID THAT LAO TZU WAS BORN OLD. HOW DID HE ACHIEVE HIS WISDOM AND MATURITY? WAS A MASTER NECESSARY TO BRING HIM TO THE POINT WHERE HE COULD BE BORN OLD?\nYOU DON’T EVEN have a sense of humor. You can’t understand a joke. These are just symbolic tales, beautiful in themselves, but if you start asking questions about them they become ugly. That’s how the whole mystery and the poetry of a thing is lost; and that is what has been done. The whole of theology is all about such nonsensical questions. “Was Jesus really born out of a virgin?” It is a beautiful symbol. “Was Jesus really resurrected when he was dead, crucified?” This is a beautiful symbol. “Was it a reality that Lao Tzu was born old, eighty-four years old, remained in his mother’s womb for eighty-four years?” It is a beautiful Lao Tzuan joke. I suspect that Lao Tzu must have spread the rumor – nobody else could do that, it is so subtle.\nIf you understand the joke, you understand. If you don’t understand please don’t ask questions. Forget about it, because questions will destroy it completely.\nIt is said that whenever a joke is told there are three kinds of laughter. The first is from those who understand it immediately – and a joke has to be understood immediately, with no time gap, otherwise you lack the sense of humor. That is the whole point of it – that suddenly it strikes, suddenly it hits somewhere inside, and you know what it is. You may not be able to explain to others why you were laughing, and the more you try to explain, the more it will become a puzzle. Why were you laughing? It is a subtle phenomenon. How does it happen?\nWhen somebody is telling a joke, the joke moves on two levels, that’s how the laughter is created. On one level everything is simple and ordinary, nothing is special, then suddenly there is a turn at the end, the punchline; at the end there is suddenly a turn – you never expected that this was going to happen. That’s why if you have heard the joke it is impossible to laugh again, because then the turn is not there, you already know it. When the sudden turn comes that you never expected, not even a single second before... everything was on plain ground and suddenly you are on Everest and everything has changed, and the change is so ridiculous, illogical, irrational... you explode in laughter. If you understand a joke you understand it immediately, without any effort on your part. It is just like satori or samadhi.\nThen there is a second type of laughter. These people understand the joke but a little time gap is needed. Then it touches only their intellect, not their whole being; their laughter comes, but the laughter is from the lips – an intellectual phenomenon. The first laughter is from the belly, the second laughter just from the head. They understand the point, but intellect always takes time, it doesn’t get a very quick grasp on something. Even the most intelligent person is a little stupid, because the nature of intellect is such that it cannot jump. It moves in logical steps, it needs time, it is a progress, a gradual phenomenon – step by step you reach the conclusion.\nThat is the second laughter. Pale it will be, not very deep, not very relaxing, not a catharsis, just an intellectual phenomenon. In the head something clicks, creates little ripples, that’s all. But the first laughter is so deep that if it really happens, a joke can become a satori. In that laughter the mind can disappear completely.\nThen there is a third kind of laughter... people who laugh because others are laughing. They have not understood, but not to be thought stupid because they have not understood, they laugh, lastly. Seeing that everybody is laughing, they have to laugh.\nMulla Nasruddin went to France once. His wife was with him and they went to see a comic show. The wife was surprised, because whenever the man, the joker on the stage, would tell a joke or\ndo something, Mulla would laugh so loudly that he would defeat the whole audience. People would start looking at him.\nThe wife couldn’t understand because she knew well that he didn’t understand French. So she asked, “Mulla, I have lived with you for thirty years and I never knew that you know French. How do you understand? And why do you laugh so loudly?”\nMulla said, “I trust the man. He must be saying something funny and when one has to laugh, why laugh last? Why not laugh first? And when one has to laugh, one should laugh loudly. It costs nothing and I am enjoying myself.”\nThis is the third kind of laughter – nothing is happening to you, it is a pretension. You think that there must have been something humorous, you trust the man or you trust other people who are laughing and not to feel stupid you join in the laughter.\nWhenever a joke is told you can immediately sort out these three kinds of laughter.\nThis is just a Lao Tzuan joke. Nobody can live in the mother’s womb for eighty-four years. Even if Lao Tzu could, think of the mother also! Lao Tzu may be enlightened and could live, but the mother... poor mother, think of her also. Even nine months is too much, but eighty-four yearsThe mother\nwould have been dead long before.\nNo, it is a subtle humor. It says that Lao Tzu was born wise. It is a symbolic thing. From his very childhood he was wise. That is the only meaning. He was so wise that the rumor spread that he was born old.\nJesus was so pure, how could he be born out of carnal desire? He was born out of carnal desire, there is no other way – life gives no exceptions. He was born out of ordinary love. But the story says something very beautiful. The story is not true and I say it is true! It is not true as a fact but it is true as a truth. And what is a fact before a truth? A fact is an ordinary facticity of life. No, Jesus’ mother was not a virgin – if you go to the ordinary facts. But she was a virgin, otherwise how could such a pure, such an innocent child be born out of her? She was virgin. She must have been very very innocent, absolutely innocent, as if she had never known any man. That is the meaning. The meaning is AS IF – as if she never knew what sex was, as if she never knew what ordinary copulation was. But those are “as ifs”; once you start forcing them as facts you are foolish. And all theologians are foolish. They try to prove that yes, she was a virgin, and God permitted an exception at that moment of history. This is a way to say a certain beautiful thing which cannot be said otherwise. This is just saying that Jesus comes out of a virgin source, Jesus comes out of a pure innocence which has not known any impurity of the world and the body. That’s all. Don’t insist that it should be explained because explanation kills the very spirit of it.\nThe last question:\nQuestion 8\nYOU SAID THAT YOU ARE MERELY A PRESENCE AND CANNOT DO ANYTHING. BUT I AND EVERYBODY ELSE FEEL ALL THE TIME THAT IN YOUR COMPASSION FOR US YOU ARE\nINFLUENCING US AND EVENTS TO BRING US CLOSER TO YOUR TEMPLE. IS THIS JUST OUR IMAGINATION PLAYING TRICKS?\nI CANNOT DO anything but my presence can. When I say I cannot do anything, I only mean that no I exists within me; the doer is dissolved. So without the doer how can you do anything? But things happen. And when the doer is dissolved then tremendous things happen. I cannot claim the authorship of them or the doership of them – I am not the doer. In fact I am not. I am just a presence with no label attached to it, just an opening. Much is possible if you are in my presence. If you allow my presence to move into you, melt into you, become part of you, much is possible. Even the impossible is possible – but I am not the doer, it happens. I am not specifically doing it.\nI am also a watcher as you are a watcher. It is happening. If you go to the sun and tell the sun that you are very grateful because it has been destroying darkness for you on the earth for so long, the sun will be surprised. The sun will say, “I don’t know what darkness is. I have never come across it. I have never destroyed it, because how can you destroy a thing that you have never come across?” But it is happening all the same: light comes, darkness disappears.\nIf you allow this presence that is here, much is possible. The darkness can disappear, but I am not the doer. I am not forcing anything on you because that would be a violence, and even if it were not a violence I cannot do it because the doer is no longer there. If you come into me you will not meet anybody there. The temple is absolutely vacant. A real temple is always empty. If you find a God sitting inside, then it is a man-made temple. Nothingness is the only temple.\nYes, I’m not doing anything to you, but much is happening. So don’t think that this may be imagination, because this may be a trick of the mind to think that this is imagination. Because then the mind can close. Thinking that this is imagination, a projection, this or that, the mind can close and then everything will stop.\n\u003c Previous | Contents\n","wordCount":"9050","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/tao_the_three_treasures_vol_1/part10/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/tao_the_three_treasures_vol_1/>Tao.

EXPLOSIONS?</p><p><br></p><p>UNDERSTANDING NEVER COMES, neither as a sudden phenomenon nor as a
gradual one, because it is always there. You have it right now. It is
not going to happen somewhere in the future. You are carrying it within
you, just as a seed carries the tree, a woman carries a child. You are
carrying it right now. Now it depends on you: if your intensity is total
you will achieve it suddenly, if your intensity is not total you will
achieve it by and by, in steps. But understanding never comes to you –
you are understanding. Enlightenment is not something that happens to
you – you are enlightenment.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember this; then it is a choice, your choice. If you desire it
totally, in that fire of total desire all that covers that understanding
burns; suddenly the light is there. But it is up to you. It is not part
of the nature of enlightenment to happen gradually or to happen
suddenly.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t throw off the responsibility, that’s how people create
philosophies and schools. In Japan two schools of Zen exist: one
believes in sudden enlightenment, another believes in gradual
enlightenment – as if these are the qualities of enlightenment, as if
they belong to enlightenment. They don’t belong to enlightenment.
Enlightenment is always there; it is for you to choose. If your</p><p>desire is total not even a single moment is lost. But if your desire
is not total it means that you yourself are not willing it to happen
right now. You want to postpone it, you want it tomorrow, some other
day. Then you go on playing tricks.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are really sincere there is no time gap, it can happen this
very moment. Not even a single moment is to be lost, because it is
already the case. One has just to look within. But if you don’t want it
right now then you can wait for millennia.</p><p><br></p><p>I would like to tell you an old story. It happened in Ceylon.</p><p><br></p><p>There was a great Buddhist Master who taught his disciples for almost
eighty years. When he was a hundred and twenty he said one day, “Now, I
am going to die after seven days.” So thousands of his disciples
gathered for his last darshan, to see him for the last time.</p><p><br></p><p>The old man, before closing his eyes and dissolving withinwards,
asked them, “Does somebody want to accompany me? If somebody wants
nirvana, enlightenment, right now, then he should simply raise his hand
and that will do.”</p><p><br></p><p>People knew that he was a man of his word, and he was not joking. He
had never joked in his whole life, he was a serious man. He meant what
he said. They started looking at each other – thousands of people and
not a single hand was raised.</p><p><br></p><p>One man stood up and he said, “Please don’t misunderstand me. I don’t
want to accompany you right now because there are many things to be
done. I have many things to fulfill, many things to pass through, many
karmas to be accounted for. As yet I am not ready for it, but someday I
would like to be enlightened. Can you give some key hints? – because you
will be no longer here.”</p><p><br></p><p>And the Master had been giving key hints his whole life, for eighty
years. Still they wanted something to be said about it so that they
could postpone and plan and think about the future. And the old Master
was ready. If somebody had been ready he was ready to take him with
himself. But nobody was ready.</p><p><br></p><p>People are cunning, because the mind is cunning. And the greatest
cunningness of the mind is that it always throws responsibility onto
something else. If enlightenment is gradual then what can you do?
Nothing can be done; it is gradual, it will take a long time. If
enlightenment is sudden then why has it not happened to you? You will
ask, “Then why has it not happened to me if it is sudden? No, it cannot
be sudden. But if it is sudden and there is no need to do something for
it to happen, then what can be done? I will wait – whenever it happens
it happens.”</p><p><br></p><p>You simply want to escape from the responsibility of your own choice.
Sartre has said one thing that is really beautiful. He said, “Man is
free to choose but man is not free not to choose.” You can choose either
way but don’t be befooled – you have no freedom not to choose, because
even when you think you are not choosing you are choosing the
opposite.</p><p><br></p><p>A man came to me and he said, “I am not yet ready for sannyas. I am
ready seventy per cent, eighty per cent, but twenty per cent I am not
ready, so how can I take sannyas? I’m not total.”</p><p>So I said, “Okay. But still you are choosing, and now you are
choosing a minor part of your mind – the twenty per cent which says,
‘Don’t take.’ Now you are choosing the twenty per cent against the
eighty per cent.”</p><p><br></p><p>So don’t think that you are not choosing. That’s not possible. You
have to choose whatsoever you do; even if you don’t choose you will be
choosing. Choice is there. One is free to choose but one is not free not
to choose. If the mind says it is gradual, it is a choice; if the mind
says it is sudden, that too is a choice. When you say it is sudden it
means that you would like to drop every effort, so you choose sudden
enlightenment. Then there is no need to do anything – when it happens it
happens, nothing can be done because it is a sudden thing. Just like
lightning in the sky, whenever it happens it happens – you cannot make
preparations for it. It is not like electricity in the house that you
put on and off, it does not depend on you. It is a sudden phenomenon,
when it happens it happens. You have to wait for it. If you are thinking
about reading a telegram when the electricity happens in the sky, then
you have to wait. When it happens you can read it. What can you do?</p><p><br></p><p>People who want to escape from effort will choose sudden
enlightenment. People who want to escape from the great, total
responsibility of it, that it can happen right now, will choose the
philosophy of gradualness.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t say anything about enlightenment – I’m saying something about
you. It is for you to feel your desire: total desire – enlightenment is
sudden, partial desire – enlightenment is gradual. It has nothing to do
with the nature of enlightenment. Remember this.</p><p><br></p><p>The second question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2</p><p><br></p><p>DO TAOISTS AGREE WITH THE HAPPENING OF SUDDEN ENLIGHTENMENT OR THE
GRADUAL ONE?</p><p><br></p><p>THEY DON’T BOTHER. Lao Tzu does not bother, because he says: Just to
be ordinary is to be enlightened. It is not something special that one
has to achieve, it is not an achievement, it is not something that one
has to reach. It is you – in your absolute ordinariness it flowers. To
be extraordinary is the disease of the ego.</p><p><br></p><p>The ego always wants to be extraordinary, someone special, unique,
incomparable – that is the hankering desire of the ego. If you can
become a Rockefeller, good; if you can become a Hitler, good; or if you
cannot become a Rockefeller or a Hitler, then renounce the world and
think of becoming a Buddha. But become someone, someone special, a
historic phenomenon.</p><p><br></p><p>Lao Tzu is not bothered about enlightenment and all that nonsense. He
says: Just be ordinary. Eat when you feel hungry, drink when you feel
thirsty and go to sleep when sleep comes. Just be as natural as the
whole existence, and suddenly there is everything in all its glory.
Nothing is needed.</p><p><br></p><p>To be ordinary is the most extraordinary state of being because the
ego dissolves. The ego is subtle. You get rid of it in one direction, it
comes from another. You push it out from one door, go inside the room
and it is sitting on the throne – it has entered from another door.
Before you even come in it is already there.</p><p>I had a friend who had a small cat, a very beautiful cat. He asked me
what name he should give to the cat. I called the cat “Ego” because the
ego is very cunning and a cat of course is cunning. There is nothing
like a cat for cunningness. So he named his cat “Ego.”</p><p><br></p><p>But by and by he got fed up. He was a lonely man, a bachelor with no
wife, no children, and he wanted always to be alone but the cat was a
continuous disturbance. He would be sleeping and she would jump on his
chest. And she would come in with bloodmarks on her paws and destroy a
whole chair-seat or his clothes, because she was continuously hunting
mice. So she was a trouble to him, and for a bachelor who had never
cared for anybody, she was too much of a wife. He asked me what to do.
This Ego had become a trouble. So I told him, “Ego is always a trouble.
You go and throw it out.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “But she knows all the ways of the town. She will come
back.” I told him, “You go to the forest.”</p><p>So he went to the forest so that the cat could not find the way home.
He went in and in – and then lost the way! Then there was only one thing
to do: he let the cat go, followed her, and came back home. That was the
only way, there was nobody else to ask. The cat came back as certain as
an arrow, not even hesitating for a single moment which way to
follow.</p><p><br></p><p>So I told him, “Your cat has the quality of the ego perfectly. You
cannot throw it out easily. Wherever you go to throw it, when you come
home, it is already there. Or sometimes you may get lost and then you
will have to follow it, because only it knows the way.”</p><p><br></p><p>The ego is very wise – wise in its cunningness. Lao Tzu does not give
the ego any foothold, any ground to stand on, so he does not talk about
enlightenment. So if you meet Lao Tzu don’t ask him, “Do you believe in
sudden enlightenment or in gradual enlightenment?” He will not answer
you. He will laugh at you: What foolishness! There is no need for any
enlightenment. That word doesn’t occur for Lao Tzu, it is not part of
his vocabulary.</p><p><br></p><p>He is very simple. He says: Just be ordinary. Why this hankering to
be extraordinary, to be someone? And if you cannot be someone in the
world then become enlightened at least. But why? Why can’t you be
satisfied and content with yourself as you are? If you ask me, to be
content with oneself as one is is enlightenment. It is nothing special,
as yogis have made it sound: kundalini rising, light showing, inner
experiences, angels and God and this and that. This is all nonsense if
you understand it. Enlightenment is nothing of this sort.</p><p><br></p><p>All these things – kundalini and the light and God and angels and
heaven and hell – are part of the magician’s bag. You want them – he
immediately produces, supplies them. You create the demand and the
magician supplies the things to you. You want something special, he
gives it to you. He exploits you. He lives on your absurd desires.</p><p><br></p><p>Lao Tzu is absolutely simple. He has no bag. He says: Why not just
be? What is wrong? What is wrong in that which you are? Why make an
effort? And who will make the effort? You will make the effort. Your
effort cannot go beyond you, and whatsoever you do, you will do. How can
it go beyond you? How can it be transcendental? By your own efforts how
can you transcend? It is not possible;</p><p>you are trying to do the impossible. You can go on jumping for
thousands of lives and nothing will be attained.</p><p><br></p><p>Accept yourself. That is the only reality there is, that is the only
possibility there is. Accept yourself as you are and suddenly everything
is transformed. Acceptance is the word for Lao Tzu, not enlightenment –
total acceptance, whatsoever the case is. Nothing else is possible.</p><p><br></p><p>This is how things are. This is how you have happened into this vast
universe. This vast universe wanted you to be like this – now you
accept.</p><p><br></p><p>There are only two choices available: either you reject yourself or
you accept yourself. If you reject then there are again two
possibilities open: you reject in a wordly way or you reject in an
other- worldly way. If you reject yourself in a worldly way it means
that you would like to be more beautiful than you are, you would like to
be more strong than you are, you would like to be more rich than you
are, you would like to have a bigger house than you have. This is to
reject in a worldly way. If you reject yourself in an other-worldly way,
the religious way, it means that you would like to attain satori,
samadhi, enlightenment, nirvana; you would like to become a Buddha; you
would like to possess God; you would like to live in infinite bliss.
This is how you reject in a religious way. These are both rejections and
both are wrong. For Lao Tzu both are equally absurd.</p><p><br></p><p>Your marketplace is a marketplace; your temple is also part of it.
Your this-worldly desires are worldly desires; your other-worldly
desires are also desires and worldly. In fact there cannot be any
other-worldly desire. Desire itself is this-worldly. Desire means this
world.</p><p><br></p><p>I would like to tell you an anecdote.</p><p><br></p><p>It happened in a Sufi’s life. A great mystic, living silently by
himself, one day was suddenly awakened by a messenger from God.</p><p><br></p><p>The messenger said, “Your prayers have been accepted. Now the Supreme
Being, the Creator, is very happy with you. You can ask, and whatsoever
you desire will be fulfilled. You ask and immediately it will be
fulfilled.”</p><p><br></p><p>The mystic was a little puzzled and he said, “You came a little late.
When I needed things, when I had many desires, you never came. Now I
have no desires, I have accepted myself, I am totally at ease, at home.
Now I don’t bother even whether God exists or not, I don’t pray to him.
I pray because it feels good. I have stopped thinking about him at all.
My prayer is not addressed to anybody anymore; I simply pray as I
breathe. It’s so beautiful whether God exists or not is irrelevant. You
came a little late. Now I have no desire.”</p><p><br></p><p>But the angel said, “This will be an offense against God. When he
says you can ask, you have to ask.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man was puzzled, he shrugged his shoulders and said, “But what to
ask? Can you suggest anything? – because I have accepted everything and
I am so fulfilled. At the most you go and tell God that I’m grateful.
Give my thanks to him. Everything is as it should be. Nothing is
lacking, everything is perfect. I am happy, blissful, and I don’t know
anything about the next moment. This moment is all, I am fulfilled. You
go and give my thanks.”</p><p>But the angel was stubborn. He said, “No, you will have to ask
something – just as a mannerism. Be a little understanding.”</p><p><br></p><p>Then the man said, “If you insist, then ask God to keep me as
desireless as I am. Give me only one thing – desirelessness...”</p><p><br></p><p>... or acceptability, they both mean the same thing.</p><p><br></p><p>Desire means rejection of something – you would like to be something
else; desirelessness means acceptance – you are happy as things are. In
fact, things are irrelevant, you are happy. You are happy, that’s the
point. Lao Tzu says: Be content as you are, nothing else is needed – and
then suddenly everything happens. In deep acceptance the ego
disappears.</p><p><br></p><p>Ego exists through rejection: whenever you reject something ego
exists. Whenever you say no ego is strengthened, but whenever you say
yes, a total yes to existence, that is the greatest meditation you can
enter into. In all other meditations you can enter but you will have to
come out. This is the only meditation in which you enter and you cannot
come out, because once you enter you are no more. Nobody can come out of
it.</p><p><br></p><p>The third question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 3</p><p><br></p><p>YOU HAVE SAID THAT ANY QUESTION IS VIOLENT, YET WE ARE ENCOURAGED TO
ASK QUESTIONS. WHY IS THIS?</p><p><br></p><p>BECAUSE YOU ARE VIOLENT and you need catharsis. You have questions to
ask; you may not have the courage to ask them, that’s why you are
encouraged. You have questions to ask; you have to pass through that.
Ask them. I’m not saying that my answers will destroy them – no. My
answers are not pointed that way. My answers have a totally different
purpose. They will make you aware that all questions are useless,
futile, absurd.</p><p><br></p><p>I would like you to come to a point where the mind stops questioning,
but that you cannot do because you are full of questions. Release them,
don’t suppress them. Be courageous. Even if you know that they are
foolish, don’t hide them, because if you hide them you will never be
able to get rid of them. Even if they are ridiculous – and all questions
are – ask.</p><p><br></p><p>And I’m not really answering your questions. Your questions cannot be
answered. Your questions are like a person who is in a delirium, whose
fever has gone very high. He is reaching one hundred eight, one hundred
nine, one hundred ten... and he is in delirium. Then he says,
“Everything is moving, the table is flying in the sky.” And he asks,
“Where is this table going?” What to say to him? Whatsoever you say will
be wrong, because the table is not going at all. And you cannot convince
the man that the table is not going anywhere, it is just in the room,
not moving at all. That will not convince him because you cannot
convince anybody against his own experience.</p><p><br></p><p>How can you convince anybody against his own experience? Conviction
is possible when his own experience supports it, otherwise not. He is
seeing that the table is flying trying to get out of the</p><p>window, that the table has wings – and not only the table, the cot he
is lying on, that too is jumping and getting ready, getting ready to
take off.… How can you convince a man who is in a delirium? If you try
to convince him you are also mad. Only a mad doctor will try to
convince. No, the doctor will say, “You don’t be worried, the table will
come back. We will bring it back, don’t be worried. We will do
something.” The doctor will try to bring his temperature down; when the
temperature comes down the table will come down by itself. When the
temperature becomes normal the table is in its place. It has always been
there – it has not moved a single inch.</p><p><br></p><p>That is the situation. I see, I know, that you are in a delirium. And
this delirium is very subtle – no temperature measuring device can
measure it, it is an inner, not a physical temperature. Inside you are
in a delirium. Then questions and questions and questions – like flies
they go on and on. I help you to ask and even encourage you to ask, just
to get rid of them. This is a catharsis, this is part of a
meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>Listening to me, by and by you will come to a point where you will
understand that all questions are futile, in fact questioning is
useless. When this realization arises in you you will have a total
change of attitude. Then questions disappear. When all questions
disappear, the answer arises. And remember well, there are not as many
answers as there are questions, there is only one answer to all
questions. Questions may be millions – the answer is one. There is only
one answer, the answer, and that is self-knowledge. So I am helping you
to become aware.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a Sufi story:</p><p><br></p><p>A few men were passing by a Sufi monastery; just curious, they came
to see what was happening there. People were in catharsis, freaking out,
screaming, jumping, going completely mad. The travelers thought, “This
is a mad monastery. We always thought that people come to attain
enlightenment here but these people have gone mad.” And the Master was
sitting amidst this catharsis, this mad chaos all around him. In the
midst of it he was sitting silently.</p><p><br></p><p>The travelers thought, “Why is the Master sitting silently?” Someone
from the group suggested that maybe he was too tired, he may have done
this madness too much.</p><p><br></p><p>Then after a few months they were coming back to their town after
their work was done, and again they passed the monastery. They again
looked to see what had happened to those mad people. But now everybody
was sitting silently, not even a single word. When they approached the
monastery they became afraid: had those people left? – because there
seemed to be nobody now. When they came in everybody was there but they
were silently sitting.</p><p><br></p><p>Then after a few months they went again on another business journey.
Curiosity led them again to the monastery. They looked, there was
nobody. Only the Master was sitting there. So they asked, “What is all
this?”</p><p><br></p><p>The Master said, “When you passed through the first time you saw the
beginners. They were full of madness and I encouraged them to bring it
out. The next time you passed they had realized, they had calmed down.
That’s why they were sitting silently. There was nothing to do. When you
passed by the third time there was no need even to be here. Now they can
be silent anywhere in the world, so I have sent them back to the world.
I am waiting for a new group. When you pass next time, again there will
be madness.”</p><p>I encourage you to ask – it is to bring your mind out. This will help
you to calm down. My answering in fact is not any effort to answer your
questions, it is an effort to kill them, to murder them. I am not a
teacher. I may be a murderer but I am not a teacher. I am not teaching
you anything, I am simply destroying your questions. Once all questions
are destroyed your head is cut off – I have murdered you. Then you are
completely silent, content, absolutely at home. No problem exists – you
live life moment to moment, you enjoy, you delight in it moment to
moment. No problem exists.</p><p><br></p><p>I am against metaphysics but I have to talk about metaphysics. My
whole work is therapeutic. I am not a metaphysician. My work is like
this: you have a thorn in your foot; I bring another thorn to take the
first thorn out of your foot. The first thorn and the second thorn are
similar, there exists no qualitative difference. When the first is out,
helped by the second, we throw away both.</p><p><br></p><p>When I bring your questions out I’m not saying put my answers in the
places left vacant by the questions – no. Throw away my answers also, as
you throw away your questions; otherwise my answers will create troubles
for you. Don’t carry my answers, they are only therapeutic. They are
like thorns: they can be used to bring other thorns out, then both have
to be thrown away.</p><p><br></p><p>The fourth question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 4</p><p><br></p><p>WERNER ERHARD, A WESTERN YOGI, SAYS THAT PROBLEMS THAT YOU HAVE BEEN
TRYING TO CHANGE OR PUT UP WITH CLEAR UP IN THE PROCESS OF LIFE ITSELF.
HOW DOES THIS RELATE TO MEDITATION? ARE THE TWO INCOMPATIBLE?</p><p><br></p><p>ERHARD IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT, but you can misunderstand him because
whatsoever he is saying is as profound as anything that Lao Tzu can say.
You can misunderstand him.</p><p><br></p><p>Try to understand it. Profundities are dangerous, and listened to by
ignorant people they can become very very dangerous. Joined with your
stupidity, a profundity can become a very great fall.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, this is absolutely right: problems that you have been trying to
change or put up with clear up in the process of life itself – that’s
true, a statement of fact, it happens that way. But then the problem
arises whether meditation is compatible with it or not. Now your
stupidity has come in.</p><p><br></p><p>Meditation is also part of life – you have to do it as you have to do
many other things. Why take meditation as something which is not part of
life? Meditation is part of life, you have to pass through it too. You
have come to meditation because something in you needed it, otherwise
why should you come? The whole world has not come to me, only a few
people have come to me. I am as available to them as I am available to
you. Even people who live in Poona have not come, and you may have
crossed oceans.</p><p><br></p><p>There is something in you, a deep desire for it.<span class=s4></span>Sex alone is not life, food alone is not life.
Meditation</p><p>is as much life as anything else, and it is your part in life to pass
through it.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, what Erhard says is absolutely true, a statement of fact.
Nothing else is needed, one needs only to live and everything settles by
itself. But meditation is also part of life, yoga is also part of</p><p>life, one has to pass through it. You cannot escape it. If you try to
escape it, that part which you have not fulfilled will always remain
hanging over you and you will feel that something has remained
incomplete.</p><p><br></p><p>Be courageous and don’t escape from anywhere. Wherever your inner
life leads you, go! Don’t bother where it leads you. Sometimes it will
lead you astray, that I know, but to go astray is also part of life.
Nobody can always be right, and people who try always to be right die
almost absolute failures. Don’t be bothered that you may go astray, if
life leads you astray, go! Go happily! The energy that leads you astray
will bring you back. That sojourn may be a part of the final growth.</p><p><br></p><p>This is my experience: that in the end one finds that everything fits
together. Everything that you did, good and bad, right and wrong, moral
and immoral – whatsoever you did, in the end one finds life is really
wonderful, everything fits. If you look back you would not like to
change anything, because if you change even a part then the whole would
be changed.</p><p><br></p><p>This is what acceptance is. This is what the Hindu attitude about
fate or the Mohammedan attitude about kismet is. The attitude is very
simple, only this: whatsoever happens, take it as part of your destiny.
Move into it. Don’t withhold yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>If you have to err, err – but err totally. If you have to fall, fall
– but fall like a drunkard, completely. Don’t resist, because then you
miss. If you have to live in darkness, live in darkness – but happily
and dancingly. Why be miserable? If you are feeling hell around you,
feel it – it may be part of your destiny, part of your growth.</p><p><br></p><p>Of course I know that when one passes through hell, it is very
difficult. That I know. Because growth is difficult. When one passes
through a problem, a heart-rending problem, a crisis, one wants to
escape; one wants not to face it; one wants to be a coward. But that way
you will miss something that was going to become a part of the final
whole, of the final harmony. If you have lived totally... I don’t make
any conditions. I say live unconditionally. If your inner voice tells
you to meditate, meditate. If your inner voice tells you to go and
drink, then drink and be a drunkard. But be total, because only through
totality does one transcend. Only through totality is one transformed
because only through totality does one start understanding what one is
doing.</p><p><br></p><p>People come to me and they say that they have much anger in them and
they would like not to have it any more. They have had enough of it and
they have suffered much for it. Their whole life has become miserable.
And they repent much, whenever they become angry they repent much. They
try again and again not to be angry, they decide not to be angry, they
put all their willpower into it, but after a few hours they have
forgotten. Again something happens, a situation occurs, and they are
angry. So what to do?</p><p><br></p><p>I tell them: Don’t repent. Begin from there. Don’t repent, at least
that much you can do. Be angry and be totally angry and don’t repent.
And don’t feel sorry about it. You have been angry, accept the fact that
you are a man with an angry nature. Okay. Be totally angry. Because that
repentance is not allowing you to be totally angry, something is being
withheld. That part which remains inside and has not been expressed
becomes poisonous, a canceric growth. It will color all your life, the
whole of your life. Be angry, and when you are angry let the phenomenon
be such that you can say, “I am anger, not angry.” Nobody is left behind
to look at it – you are anger. It will become a fire, a hellfire.</p><p>It will be great suffering but it has to be so. It may be that if you
can be really in a hellfire only once you will become so alert about it
that there will be no need to decide against it. The very experience
will have decided everything – you will never go near it again. Not that
you take a vow against it, not that you go to the church and confess and
repent.… People start enjoying that too; they start indulging in
repentance also.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard that a woman came for the seventh time to the Father in
the church to confess a sin. Even the Father was a little surprised
because it was the same sin again and again – that she had made love to
a man to whom she was not married.</p><p><br></p><p>So the Father said, “Have you committed the sin seven times or only
once?” She said, “Only once.”</p><p>So he said, “Then why do you go on confessing it? You have already
confessed seven times.” She said, “I love to talk about it. It’s so
beautiful just to think about it.”</p><p>Even in imagination, confessing to a Father.…</p><p><br></p><p>People start indulging in their repentance, confessions. They may
even exaggerate – this has been my feeling. Saint Augustine’s book
CONFESSIONS seems to be an exaggeration; he seems to be indulging in it.
The very idea of committing so many sins seems to be appealing. In
India, Gandhi’s autobiography seems to be an exaggeration. He goes on
talking and talking about his sins, it seems he is enjoying it. And now
psychologists say that there are people who exaggerate their sins
because then, against that background, they become great saints. Because
they have not left ordinary sins, they were such great sinners, and now
they have become such great saints! The distance is vast and the
revolution great.</p><p><br></p><p>Only a great sinner can be a great saint. How can an ordinary sinner
be? You smoke a cigarette – do you think you can become an Augustine or
a Gandhi just because you smoked a cigarette once, or you looked at a
woman and a lust arose in you, that’s all? That won’t do, it is not
enough material. You cannot create a big saint out of small sins, you
have to be a great sinner.</p><p><br></p><p>So people who write their autobiographies should never be believed. I
must have read thousands of autobiographies but this is my observation:
that there exists no other sort of fiction which is more fictitious.
Autobiography is the greatest fiction. All autobiographies are
fictitious. Either one goes on praising himself or one goes on
condemning himself, but both are untrue because in both ways one starts
becoming extraordinary. The ego cannot be fulfilled by just being
ordinary.</p><p><br></p><p>Somebody asked Rinzai, “What do you do? What is your practice, what
is your SADHANA?”</p><p><br></p><p>And he said such a simple thing – how could you make an autobiography
out of it? He said, “When I feel hungry I eat, and when I feel sleepy I
go to sleep, that’s all.”</p><p><br></p><p>How can you make an autobiography out of it? And Rinzai would not
look like a great saint either. What type of a saint would this be?</p><p>After Rinzai died, his disciple was lecturing in a monastery. A man
belonging to the opposite sect stood up; he was feeling very jealous
because so many people had come to listen.</p><p><br></p><p>So he stood up and he said, “One question, sir. You are talking too
much about your Master. But mine is a real Master, he can do thousands
of miracles. I have seen with my own eyes: he was standing on one bank
of the river, and it was the time of rains and the river was flooded.
And on the other bank a disciple was standing with a copy-book in his
hand. On one bank my Master wrote with a pencil and it was written on
the disciple’s copy-book on the other bank. Can you say anything about
your Master, what miracles he did?”</p><p><br></p><p>The disciple said, “I know only of one miracle that my Master used to
do – every day, every minute Silence fell all over the hall. People
became curious: what miracle had Rinzai done?</p><p>The disciple said, “When he felt hungry he ate and when he felt
sleepy he slept. That’s the only miracle that he did.”</p><p><br></p><p>You will not think it much of a miracle but it is. It is a very
profound phenomenon. It means to be natural completely. You are almost
fighting. When you feel hungry you don’t eat because a thousand and one
other things have to be done; when you don’t feel hungry you eat because
now is the time to eat. When you feel sleepy you avoid it because there
is a dance worth going to, or a movie worth seeing. When you feel sleepy
you are sitting in the movie. When you don’t feel sleepy, because the
movie has excited you too much, now you try to go to sleep and you have
to take tranquilizers.</p><p><br></p><p>To be unnatural has become our natural life. Of course to be natural
is a miracle, the greatest miracle: just to delight in ordinary things,
in eating, sleeping, drinking, the breeze that passes you.… Enjoying
ordinary things, delighting in them, the whole of life becomes a
celebration.</p><p><br></p><p>Erhard is right. He is saying a Lao Tzuan thing: “Problems that you
have been trying to change or put up with clear up in the process of
life itself.” Live life, live in its totality, move in all its
dimensions – indulge in every dimension, indulge totally, and in the end
you will find that everything helped. Everything, I say: even the wife
who created so much misery for you, even that; even the child that you
loved so much and died early, even that; even the business that failed
and you became broke, yes, even that. Everything! Failure and success,
pain and pleasure, right and wrong, going astray and coming back home –
everything helps.</p><p><br></p><p>And out of this chaos arises a harmony. But one has to live it
totally. I am not saying that everyone reaches to that harmony. No, that
is a possibility. One can reach, one may miss, and people who miss are
those people who try hard to reach it. People who attain to it are
people who don’t bother much about attaining it, they simply live moment
to moment.</p><p><br></p><p>That final harmony, that crescendo, is a cumulative effect. So enjoy
wherever you are, be grateful, whatever you have. Feel deep gratitude –
let that be your only prayer. Go totally wherever you go. If you go to a
prostitute, go totally... and I know that even to your wife you have not
gone totally. If you drink wine, drink it totally... and I know you have
not even drunk water totally.</p><p><br></p><p>This incomplete life cannot become a crescendo; this life lived
always incomplete, fragmentary, cannot create a harmony. You will die a
chaos – that’s why you will die always afraid of death.</p><p>And when death knocks at your door you will tremble – because the
life harmony has not yet been achieved, and death has come. You have not
lived life, and death has come. You are as yet incomplete, in fact
unborn, and death has come. You tremble.</p><p><br></p><p>A man who has lived his life, one who has lived his day, always
accepts death beautifully, because there is nothing left to be done any
more. He has done all, he has lived all and he moved in all directions.
All that life could give he had accumulated in him. He has accumulated
the honey of life, now he is ready to die. There is nothing else.</p><p><br></p><p>Do you know? – for one spoonful of honey a bee has to visit five
thousand flowers – for one spoonful of honey five thousand flowers! And
for one pound of honey – scientists have measured – they say thousands
of miles have to be traveled by bees. One spoonful of honey five
thousand flowers! One spoonful of harmony and five thousand experiences,
thousands and thousands of experiences.…</p><p><br></p><p>And remember only one thing: wherever you are be totally there,
otherwise you will visit the flower and you will come away without the
honey. That is the only misery that can happen to a man and that happens
to almost ninety-nine per cent of people. You are in such a hurry – just
think of a bee in such a hurry that she goes to the flower but never
touches it because she is in such a hurry to go to another flower.
Incomplete, she moves to another flower but by the time she has reached
the other flower the idea is hankering in her mind to go to another. She
visits five thousand or five million flowers and comes back
empty-handed. Don’t be that type of bee! When you visit a flower, really
visit it. Forget about all other flowers in the world – there exist no
others at that moment. Just be a bee – hum and delight and enjoy the
flower. Be with it as totally as possible. Then you accumulate life’s
honey and when you die you die blissfully, ecstatically. You lived.
There is no complaint in your heart, no grudge. And I tell you that if
you have lived all moments in their totality, in awareness, at the
moment of death you can bless all – your friends and your enemies. Yes,
your enemies also, because without them you would not have been able to
reach to this crescendo. They were part, part of a mysterious phenomenon
that is life.</p><p><br></p><p>The fifth question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 5</p><p><br></p><p>YOU ONCE SAID THAT IN THE QUESTION LIES THE ANSWER SO THE NATURE OF
THE QUESTION DETERMINES THE NATURE OF THE ANSWER. WHAT IS THEN THE MOST
FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION THE MIND CAN ASK?</p><p><br></p><p>THE MIND CAN never ask any fundamental question because whatsoever
the mind asks is bound to be superficial. When the question arises out
of your being, not out of your mind, it will not be verbal, it will be
existential. You will be the question – then it is fundamental.</p><p><br></p><p>A Sufi mystic used to come to the mosque every day and he would stand
there not saying a single word, for years and years. People became
curious.</p><p><br></p><p>Somebody asked, “You never say anything, we have not even seen your
lips quivering a little and we have watched you, observed you closely.
We don’t feel that even inside you are saying anything, you stand there
like a rock. What type of prayer is this?”</p><p>The mystic said, “Once it happened that a beggar was standing before
a palace of an emperor. The emperor came out, looked at the beggar and
said, ‘What do you ask? What do you want?’ The beggar said, ‘If by
looking at me you cannot understand, then there is no need to say. I
will go to another house. Look at me – naked in the cold winter,
shivering. Look at my belly – it has joined the back. Look at my limbs –
all the flesh has disappeared. I am a skeleton and you ask what do I
want? Is my being here not enough?’ The king became afraid, the beggar
was right. Much was given to him.”</p><p><br></p><p>And the mystic said, “I was passing by on the road. From that day I
stopped praying, because what to say to the emperor of the world? Can’t
he understand what misery I am in? Have I to say it? Assert it? Have I
to be articulate with him? If he cannot understand my being, what use
will it be to talk? Then it is useless: if he cannot understand my being
he cannot understand my language. Silent is my prayer, unquestioned is
my question, undesired is my desire. It is me, it is my total
being.”</p><p><br></p><p>That is fundamental, that is foundational, that is radical – it comes
from the very roots. The word radical comes from “roots.” A radical, a
foundational, a fundamental question is never asked by the mind. The
mind cannot ask it; the mind is impotent about it. The mind is just like
the waves on the ocean. Can you ask me which wave is the deepest? No
wave is, no wave can be, because waves can exist only on the surface,
they cannot be in the depth. In the depth there are no waves.</p><p><br></p><p>The mind is the surface, the waves. All questions raised by the mind
are superficial. The fundamental question is asked when the mind has
been dropped. It is a no-mind question, it is a being question. Then you
stand with a question not even verbalized within you, because who will
verbalize it? The mind has been put aside, your whole existence is a
question mark.</p><p><br></p><p>And when that fundamental question is asked only then can the Master
give you himself in his totality. He can pour himself into your being.
When you ask a superficial question, of course a fundamental answer
cannot be given, because it will fall on deaf ears, on dead hearts. When
you ask a question the quality of the answer is already decided in
it.</p><p><br></p><p>The sixth question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 6</p><p><br></p><p>YOU CALLED US THE “ANCIENT ONES.” IF WE HAVE BEEN WITH OTHER MASTERS
IN PAST LIVES, HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT WE COULD HAVE MISSED THEM SO
CONSISTENTLY?</p><p><br></p><p>BECAUSE YOU ARE very consistent. Be a little inconsistent, otherwise
you will miss me also. The seventh question:</p><p>Question 7</p><p><br></p><p>YOU SAID THAT LAO TZU WAS BORN OLD. HOW DID HE ACHIEVE HIS WISDOM AND
MATURITY? WAS A MASTER NECESSARY TO BRING HIM TO THE POINT WHERE HE
COULD BE BORN OLD?</p><p>YOU DON’T EVEN have a sense of humor. You can’t understand a joke.
These are just symbolic tales, beautiful in themselves, but if you start
asking questions about them they become ugly. That’s how the whole
mystery and the poetry of a thing is lost; and that is what has been
done. The whole of theology is all about such nonsensical questions.
“Was Jesus really born out of a virgin?” It is a beautiful symbol. “Was
Jesus really resurrected when he was dead, crucified?” This is a
beautiful symbol. “Was it a reality that Lao Tzu was born old,
eighty-four years old, remained in his mother’s womb for eighty-four
years?” It is a beautiful Lao Tzuan joke. I suspect that Lao Tzu must
have spread the rumor – nobody else could do that, it is so subtle.</p><p><br></p><p>If you understand the joke, you understand. If you don’t understand
please don’t ask questions. Forget about it, because questions will
destroy it completely.</p><p><br></p><p>It is said that whenever a joke is told there are three kinds of
laughter. The first is from those who understand it immediately – and a
joke has to be understood immediately, with no time gap, otherwise you
lack the sense of humor. That is the whole point of it – that suddenly
it strikes, suddenly it hits somewhere inside, and you know what it is.
You may not be able to explain to others why you were laughing, and the
more you try to explain, the more it will become a puzzle. Why were you
laughing? It is a subtle phenomenon. How does it happen?</p><p><br></p><p>When somebody is telling a joke, the joke moves on two levels, that’s
how the laughter is created. On one level everything is simple and
ordinary, nothing is special, then suddenly there is a turn at the end,
the punchline; at the end there is suddenly a turn – you never expected
that this was going to happen. That’s why if you have heard the joke it
is impossible to laugh again, because then the turn is not there, you
already know it. When the sudden turn comes that you never expected, not
even a single second before... everything was on plain ground and
suddenly you are on Everest and everything has changed, and the change
is so ridiculous, illogical, irrational... you explode in laughter. If
you understand a joke you understand it immediately, without any effort
on your part. It is just like satori or samadhi.</p><p><br></p><p>Then there is a second type of laughter. These people understand the
joke but a little time gap is needed. Then it touches only their
intellect, not their whole being; their laughter comes, but the laughter
is from the lips – an intellectual phenomenon. The first laughter is
from the belly, the second laughter just from the head. They understand
the point, but intellect always takes time, it doesn’t get a very quick
grasp on something. Even the most intelligent person is a little stupid,
because the nature of intellect is such that it cannot jump. It moves in
logical steps, it needs time, it is a progress, a gradual phenomenon –
step by step you reach the conclusion.</p><p><br></p><p>That is the second laughter. Pale it will be, not very deep, not very
relaxing, not a catharsis, just an intellectual phenomenon. In the head
something clicks, creates little ripples, that’s all. But the first
laughter is so deep that if it really happens, a joke can become a
satori. In that laughter the mind can disappear completely.</p><p><br></p><p>Then there is a third kind of laughter... people who laugh because
others are laughing. They have not understood, but not to be thought
stupid because they have not understood, they laugh, lastly. Seeing that
everybody is laughing, they have to laugh.</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla Nasruddin went to France once. His wife was with him and they
went to see a comic show. The wife was surprised, because whenever the
man, the joker on the stage, would tell a joke or</p><p>do something, Mulla would laugh so loudly that he would defeat the
whole audience. People would start looking at him.</p><p><br></p><p>The wife couldn’t understand because she knew well that he didn’t
understand French. So she asked, “Mulla, I have lived with you for
thirty years and I never knew that you know French. How do you
understand? And why do you laugh so loudly?”</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla said, “I trust the man. He must be saying something funny and
when one has to laugh, why laugh last? Why not laugh first? And when one
has to laugh, one should laugh loudly. It costs nothing and I am
enjoying myself.”</p><p><br></p><p>This is the third kind of laughter – nothing is happening to you, it
is a pretension. You think that there must have been something humorous,
you trust the man or you trust other people who are laughing and not to
feel stupid you join in the laughter.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever a joke is told you can immediately sort out these three
kinds of laughter.</p><p><br></p><p>This is just a Lao Tzuan joke. Nobody can live in the mother’s womb
for eighty-four years. Even if Lao Tzu could, think of the mother also!
Lao Tzu may be enlightened and could live, but the mother... poor
mother, think of her also. Even nine months is too much, but eighty-four
years<span class=s4></span>The mother</p><p>would have been dead long before.</p><p><br></p><p>No, it is a subtle humor. It says that Lao Tzu was born wise. It is a
symbolic thing. From his very childhood he was wise. That is the only
meaning. He was so wise that the rumor spread that he was born old.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus was so pure, how could he be born out of carnal desire? He was
born out of carnal desire, there is no other way – life gives no
exceptions. He was born out of ordinary love. But the story says
something very beautiful. The story is not true and I say it is true! It
is not true as a fact but it is true as a truth. And what is a fact
before a truth? A fact is an ordinary facticity of life. No, Jesus’
mother was not a virgin – if you go to the ordinary facts. But she was a
virgin, otherwise how could such a pure, such an innocent child be born
out of her? She was virgin. She must have been very very innocent,
absolutely innocent, as if she had never known any man. That is the
meaning. The meaning is AS IF – as if she never knew what sex was, as if
she never knew what ordinary copulation was. But those are “as ifs”;
once you start forcing them as facts you are foolish. And all
theologians are foolish. They try to prove that yes, she was a virgin,
and God permitted an exception at that moment of history. This is a way
to say a certain beautiful thing which cannot be said otherwise. This is
just saying that Jesus comes out of a virgin source, Jesus comes out of
a pure innocence which has not known any impurity of the world and the
body. That’s all. Don’t insist that it should be explained because
explanation kills the very spirit of it.</p><p><br></p><p>The last question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 8</p><p><br></p><p>YOU SAID THAT YOU ARE MERELY A PRESENCE AND CANNOT DO ANYTHING. BUT I
AND EVERYBODY ELSE FEEL ALL THE TIME THAT IN YOUR COMPASSION FOR US YOU
ARE</p><p>INFLUENCING US AND EVENTS TO BRING US CLOSER TO YOUR TEMPLE. IS THIS
JUST OUR IMAGINATION PLAYING TRICKS?</p><p><br></p><p>I CANNOT DO anything but my presence can. When I say I cannot do
anything, I only mean that no I exists within me; the doer is dissolved.
So without the doer how can you do anything? But things happen. And when
the doer is dissolved then tremendous things happen. I cannot claim the
authorship of them or the doership of them – I am not the doer. In fact
I am not. I am just a presence with no label attached to it, just an
opening. Much is possible if you are in my presence. If you allow my
presence to move into you, melt into you, become part of you, much is
possible. Even the impossible is possible – but I am not the doer, it
happens. I am not specifically doing it.</p><p><br></p><p>I am also a watcher as you are a watcher. It is happening. If you go
to the sun and tell the sun that you are very grateful because it has
been destroying darkness for you on the earth for so long, the sun will
be surprised. The sun will say, “I don’t know what darkness is. I have
never come across it. I have never destroyed it, because how can you
destroy a thing that you have never come across?” But it is happening
all the same: light comes, darkness disappears.</p><p><br></p><p>If you allow this presence that is here, much is possible. The
darkness can disappear, but I am not the doer. I am not forcing anything
on you because that would be a violence, and even if it were not a
violence I cannot do it because the doer is no longer there. If you come
into me you will not meet anybody there. The temple is absolutely
vacant. A real temple is always empty. If you find a God sitting inside,
then it is a man-made temple. Nothingness is the only temple.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, I’m not doing anything to you, but much is happening. So don’t
think that this may be imagination, because this may be a trick of the
mind to think that this is imagination. Because then the mind can close.
Thinking that this is imagination, a projection, this or that, the mind
can close and then everything will stop.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part9>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a></p><p>  </p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_psychology_of_the_esoteric/part10/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>10 Windows to the divine</span>

DISCRIMINATION -- YOU TRUST EVERYBODY AND EVERYBODY BETRAYS YOU.</p><p><br></p><p>The question is very strange because the first quality of intellect
is discrimination. A man of intellect is bound to be a man of
discrimination. Intellect has no function. Its only function is to
decide what is right, what is wrong. Discrimination is its whole area.
So if you say that I am a man of intellect, then the second part of your
question becomes inconsistent with the first part. And you can see this
is discrimination; the first part of your question is inconsistent with
the second part.</p><p>You say that I trust everybody and everybody betrays me. I wonder how
you have come to this conclusion. I certainly trust everybody but nobody
has ever betrayed me, because my trust is not conditional. This has to
be understood.</p><p>Your trust can be betrayed if you have a condition in it. If I trust
you without any condition there is no possibility of betraying me.
Whatever you do I will still trust you. You can kill me but you cannot
destroy my trust. I will die trusting you.</p><p>If you do anything that appears to others as betrayal that simply
means you are betraying yourself, you are falling from your own dignity.
But you cannot betray me. I have never experienced any betrayal in my
life. I cannot condemn anybody of betraying. Everybody has behaved the
way that he could and I had never expected him to behave in any other
way. I have trusted him the way he is. My</p><p>trust is not a demand that you have to behave in a certain way. So
whatever you do, you are doing to yourself, not to me.</p><p>But whoever has asked the question is unaware of an unconditional
trust, an unconditional love. All our love, all our trust, is
conditional. And because it is conditional it is not authentic, it is
not true. Then if the person behaves a little bit differently, goes in a
different direction than you have been demanding, directly or
indirectly, immediately you start condemning him, that he has betrayed
you. You had assumed that you had purchased the person and his future
too. The future remains open. You cannot say what the other is going to
do tomorrow and whatever he is going to do he is going to do to himself.
You should not be affected by it. If you are affected by it then you are
not a man of enlightenment.</p><p>I am not affected at all by what people do to me. My concern is that
I remain the same whatever they do -- whether they are for me or against
me, whether they are my friends or they become my enemies, it does not
matter. My love, my trust, will remain the same.</p><p>I am amazed for many reasons. First, anybody who listens to me, who
has read me, will find out very easily that I am not a man of intellect,
because intellectually you can find a thousand and one inconsistencies
and contradictions in my statements. But I do not see any inconsistency,
any self-contradiction, because to me life is not logic and to find the
truth of life, intellect is not the way. Life is a mystery, you cannot
figure out what it is. You can experience it, taste it, sing it, dance
it, but you cannot explain it. You cannot make a theory out of it.</p><p>The moment you start making a theory, immediately the mystery of life
disappears. The function of the intellect is to theorize. Science
depends on intellect. That's why it can be said that the whole effort of
science is to demystify existence. Science divides existence into two
categories: the known and the unknown. And what is known today was
unknown yesterday, and what is unknown today may be known tomorrow so
the distinction is not of any quality</p><p>-- it is just a question of time and man's search. Science can
conceive a day when all will be known and the category of the unknown
will disappear. This is the way of the intellect: to demystify, to make
everything known, to destroy the unknown.</p><p>How can you say that I am a man of intellect? I am doing just the
opposite. My whole effort is to make even the known unknown. To bring
mystery back into your life -- even in small things which you have
started taking for granted, I want you to have another look.</p><p>I am reminded of one of the most beautiful persons of this century,
D.H. Lawrence. He was walking in a garden with a small boy and, just as
small children are curious, the boy was asking this question and that
question. At one question, even D.H. Lawrence was stunned. The small
child asked, "Please forgive me. I must be tiring you by asking
questions, but this is the last: I want to know why the trees are
green."</p><p>And the answer that came from D.H. Lawrence is significant; it is not
the answer of the intellect. He said, "The trees are green because they
are green."</p><p>The boy agreed, that's perfectly right. But Lawrence went on
thinking, "Is that an answer? Will anybody who approaches life
intellectually be satisfied with it?" But the reality is that whatever
we know is surrounded by infinite unknowability; not only the
unknown.</p><p>And that's where I make a difference. Objective science divides life,
existence, into two categories -- the known and the unknown. The science
of the interior divides life into three categories -- the known, the
unknown and the unknowable. And the unknowable is the most important,
because ultimately you have to face it. And the moment you face the
unknowable you have to recognize your ignorance, you have to become
again a small child.</p><p>Socrates is reported to have said, "When I was young I thought I knew
everything." And he was a great intellectual. "When I grew a little
older I was not so certain, a little older still and there was more
uncertainty, a little older still and now I could not say with certainty
that I know anything."</p><p>And before he died he said, "Only one thing I know, that I know
nothing." This is from the man who had one of the keenest intellects;
but he had something more, higher and deeper than intellect, and that is
intuition.</p><p>I am not a man of intellect, because my whole work is with the
unknowable. The method of science is intellect, the method of the inner
world is intuition. Intellect is absolutely meaningless.</p><p>When you start moving inwards, deeper into meditation, awareness,
consciousness, you will become more and more aware of the mysterious,
the miraculous, and you will become aware of the fact that existence
basically is unknowable. We can know little bits and pieces here and
there and it is enough for our practical life but the deeper you move
you always come across a wall.</p><p>There was a time one century before that scientists were very
optimistic because science was coming to know more and more every day.
But after Albert Einstein things have changed totally. Albert Einstein
came to the deepest, the very inside of matter, and was puzzled because
what he came to understand was so mysterious, so illogical, that even to
make a scientific theory from it appeared impossible.</p><p>One thing was that as the atom was divided into electrons Einstein
became aware that electrons don't travel from one place to another. They
simply, from point A, disappear and appear at point B -- they don't
travel between. You have no trace at all of their traveling, no
footprints. How to explain it? It comes closer to magic than to science;
it comes closer to the great experiences of the meditators than to
science.</p><p>When I read this I remembered one of the great meditators: Basho
says, "On the way to truth there is no path. It is like a bird flying in
the sky, it leaves no footprints behind it." Of course in the air no
footprints can be left. I simply remembered the words `it leaves no
footprints behind it.'</p><p>And Albert Einstein finds electrons moving from point A to point B
and in between no footprints. No trace. As if they disappear from one
point and appear at another point -- which is absolutely illogical. It
troubled Albert Einstein for many days to declare to his scientific
friends that he had come across a phenomenon which was beyond intellect.
But what could he do? This is the way existence is behaving and
existence has no obligation to fulfill our requirements of intellect,
logic, consistency. We have to go with existence; existence is not going
to go with us.</p><p>The latest scientific researches have become more and more mystical
and this is one of the greatest hopes, that soon we can make a single
science. There is no need of religions and there is no need of science
-- a single science with two wings. The interior wing which is
mysterious and the outside wing which is also mysterious. Now it is
possible because both are entering into the area of mystery. It has
happened many times but people don't take note of it because it is so
rare. You must have heard the name of Madame Curie -- she was one of the
Nobel Prize winner scientists -- and she was working on a scientific
problem for years and was not getting anywhere. One night she worked
late and was really getting tired and fed up with the problem -- she was
almost going to drop the idea and start some other project. What is the
point of wasting time on something which has taken four or five years of
her life and she is still just where she was at the beginning -- not a
single glimpse, not a single clue. And life is short; you cannot waste
your whole life on a single scientific problem.</p><p>That night she went to sleep thinking, "Tomorrow I am going to burn
all the papers that I have written these five years -- I am finished
with it." In the morning when she woke up she was surprised, she could
not believe it. On her table, in her open notebook that she had left the
night before, the answer was written. And the most puzzling thing was
that the room was locked from within; nobody had entered. Her husband
was also a scientist but if Madame Curie could not solve the problem in
five years then he could not manage in just one night. And moreover, he
was not at home, he had gone on a trip.</p><p>As she watched closely it became more and more mysterious -- the
handwriting was hers. Then she closed her eyes and tried to remember
what had happened, and then the whole scene revealed itself.â¦</p><p>Now she remembered that in the night she had had a dream. She had
gone to the table, written the answer, went back to her bed and
forgotten all about it. It was not a dream, it was a reality, because
the notebook and the answer was the proof that she had not dreamt, but
from where did this answer come? Because there was nothing else on the
page, only the answer.</p><p>It was not from her intellect -- from her intellect she had been
working for five years. But because she got tired the intellect said,
"it is beyond me." She slept with this idea that "I am finished with it"
-- this was the decision of the intellect and in such moments intuition
takes over. Intuition takes over only when</p><p>intellect is finished. Intellect is for a lower reality -- for the
mundane world. Intuition is for the higher reality, for the mysterious,
for the miraculous.</p><p>Then she worked out backwards from the answer the whole process and
found that the answer was right. This is similar, exactly similar to the
case of Gautam Buddha. But nobody has even compared the two
processes.</p><p>Gautam Buddha became enlightened on the night when he had decided to
drop all efforts. He was tired, he has done everything that was told by
the masters, teachers, scriptures and he did everything to his best and
nothing had happened. Twelve years had passed since he had left his
palace and his hands were as empty as ever. It was a full moon night,
sitting under a tree he decided that the whole search was futile -- `I
am finished with it.'</p><p>With the same attitude in which Madame Curie went to her bed, Buddha
went to sleep under the tree. And in the morning when he opened his
eyes, as the sun was rising, he was amazed to look at the world. It was
not the world he had slept in. These were not the eyes that he had gone
to sleep with -- he had new eyes and a new world. It was luminous, it
was mystery all over. And all his anxiety had disappeared, all his
questioning had disappeared -- there was absolute silence and immense
tranquillity.</p><p>For the first time he felt he was at home, he had arrived -- now
there was nowhere to go, the goal was achieved. The intellect had been
working for twelve years -- tired, it dropped out of the way, gave space
for intuition to move in; and what is impossible for the intellect is
not impossible for intuition.</p><p>For intuition is a totally different approach, it is an innocent
approach with no logic. It is the approach of the child when he is born
and opens his eyes for the first time. He knows nothing but he sees
everything, although he cannot say, "what are the walls and what are the
pillars and what are people and what are animals?" -- he cannot
discriminate. But he is seeing everything. He cannot describe, he has no
words, but that does not mean that he is not seeing.</p><p>Intuition is pure seeing -- it is not a process, it is a quantum
leap.</p><p>I am not a man of intellect. I have left it far, far away. Whatever I
am saying to you is my intuitive experience. That's why you can find in
my statements many inconsistencies because intuition knows no
inconsistencies, no contradictions; but when you think about those
realities with intellect you are looking from a totally different angle,
with a totally different methodology -- that creates the trouble. You
immediately see this is inconsistent, this is contradictory. Whoever has
asked the question knows nothing about intellect and knows nothing about
discrimination either. Because to know about intellect and to know about
discrimination you have to be higher than both -- only from a sunlit
peak can you see the lower realities.</p><p>This question was given yesterday too and I had chosen to answer it
but because the time was up I had left it. I was surprised that today it
is different -- it is not exactly the same question as it was yesterday.
You cannot deceive me and you should never try it: yesterday it was more
stupid and the person must have</p><p>thought over and over again how to put it in a better way so it is
less stupid. But stupidity is stupidity. It makes no difference.</p><p>Yesterday it was, "Osho, you are a giant of the intellect but you
don't know discrimination."</p><p>The man must have thought `a giant of the intellect' and `is unable
to discriminate' looks obviously nonsense, because intellect's function
is discrimination. And if you are a giant of intellect, then your whole
work is discrimination; very delicate and very refined
discrimination.</p><p>But you did well to remove that word `giant' because I am not a
giant, I am a simple human being. It would have been even nicer of you
if you had removed the word `intellect' too. If you had said, "Osho, you
are not a man of intellect," I would have appreciated your
understanding. I am not.</p><p>But you had to put in the word 'intellect' because you wanted to make
the point about discrimination. If you accept me as not a man of
intellect then there is no question that I am not a man of
discrimination -- the question cannot be made. Just to declare that I am
not a man of discrimination, unwillingly you had to accept me as a man
of intellect.</p><p>There is no need. You could have simply said , "Osho, you are not a
man of discrimination," and I am not. I don't discriminate between
friends and enemies, between men and women, between white and black,
between Hindu and Mohammedan, between one nation and another nation; I
don't discriminate in any way. All these discriminations are crimes.</p><p>All these discriminations have to be dropped and this is not the
first time that this point has been made to me. On different occasions,
by different people, for different reasons, it has been pointed out to
me.</p><p>I would like to tell you a few points so that you can understand what
is boiling in your unconscious.</p><p>One of the Congress presidents in India, U.N. Dhebar, was attending
my camps and there should have been no difficulty, but one day he told
me, "Osho, you are the real inheritor of Mahatma Gandhi's ideology,
although you have never been with Mahatma Gandhi. You have never been
associated with Gandhism, but if you start teaching Gandhism, then it
can be saved from dying."</p><p>I said, "It would have been better if you had not said this, because
I hate to be anybody's successor and I hate to propagate anyone else's
philosophy."</p><p>And that day I criticized Mahatma Gandhi on many points. I would
never have bothered because there are millions of people in the world; I
am not going to criticize everybody, there is not time for that. But
U.N. Dhebar just pointed me towards Mahatma Gandhi, so he was
responsible, he was present.</p><p>After the meeting I asked him, "If you have anything to say you can
say it to me now or you can say in the next meeting before everybody. I
am willing to have an open discussion about it because I think that
Gandhism should die if India has to live. If Gandhism continues then
India will have to die. And if I have to choose</p><p>between the two I would choose that India live -- Gandhi is already
dead. It does not matter if Gandhism also dies. Who cares?"</p><p>He said, "No I cannot discuss it publicly. I understand what you say
is right, but you should be more discriminative."</p><p>I said, "You are a politician, I am not a politician. A politician
has to be discriminative, but why should I be?"</p><p>He said, "I am simply telling you that you have such a great
following in the Gandhians that if you say things against Gandhi all
these people will leave. They will not leave Gandhism, they will leave
you. That's why I am saying you should be more discriminative. When you
make any statement you should wait and see whether it is going in favor
of you or against you." And he was giving friendly advice. But what he
actually meant by discrimination was diplomacy.</p><p>I am not a diplomat.</p><p>I said, "I will say whatever feels to me to be the right thing,
whatever the consequences."</p><p>I have lost many followers in these thirty years in the same way.
When I criticized Gandhi, all the communists and socialists started
coming closer to me; they thought that I must be a communist. Who else
is going to criticize Gandhi? The president of the communist party told
me, "We can be immensely helped by you because we don't have any person
of your charisma who can influence the masses."</p><p>But I said, "Wait. I did not speak against Gandhism because I am a
communist -- now you have created another trouble, I will have to speak
against communism." And again the same advice: "No, Osho, you have to be
very discriminative. These people can be of immense help to you. The
communist party is the most organized party in the country and if they
are behind you, your work. "</p><p>I said, "Forget all about work. First let me finish the communists
because they have come under a misunderstanding and I don't want anybody
to be with me under any misunderstanding." And I had to criticize
communism just because of their desire.</p><p>And this has been happening politically, socially, religiously. I
have got people</p><p>who love me in every religion. There are rabbis who have written
letters to me, that "You have made us understand our own religion, you
have given us new insight, but then strangely sometimes you start
criticizing. You should be more discriminative, say only good things
about people then you will have millions of followers. And what is the
point of bringing things up which are not right."</p><p>Their intention is good but what they are telling me is that I have
to be basically a politician.</p><p>On my way to Nepal, in Delhi, friends gathered and said, "Before you
leave for Nepal we have to say a few things: one, don't speak against
Hinduism there!"</p><p>I said, "Why?" I was not aware, I may not have spoken about Hinduism
at all.</p><p>They said, "It is a Hindu kingdom and the constitution is based on
Hinduism. The constitution declares this is the only Hindu kingdom in
the world. So avoid that."</p><p>I said, "Now it is going to be difficult. If you wanted me to avoid
it you should not have mentioned it. You should be more discriminative
-- I cannot be!"</p><p>I have never been diplomatic, I have never been political. I say only
that which feels right in the moment to be said. I don't think about the
next moment.</p><p>I have spoken on all religions. I have spoken on their beauties, on
their greatness, on their high flights of ecstasy, and from every
religion people have come to me; but the moment I showed them that there
is a darker side also, that these small moments of ecstasy and flight
into the higher regions of consciousness are very few.â¦ Your whole
history is full of bloodshed, killing, murdering, burning people alive.
I cannot just go on praising those few good points which are to do with
only a few good people. I will have to say the whole thing. And
ninety-nine percent is rubbish. If I don't say it then I am committing a
crime against truth itself.</p><p>So I am not a man of intellect -- you are right. And I don't know how
to discriminate -- you are right. But I am perfectly happy and content
as I am, and you are not. Before saying anything of advice always think
to whom you are saying it.</p><p>I am absolutely fulfilled. I don't need even a single moment more to
live. Even death will be welcome right now because I know there is no
death. There is only truth. And once you have experienced it, it does
not matter what happens to you, what happens to your body, because
nothing can change your inner climate, the inner blissfulness, the inner
beautitude. The inner dance continues in spite of it all.</p><p>HOW CAN A MEDITATOR KNOW THAT HE IS GOING HIGHER AND DEEPER, OR IF HE
IS STUCK SOMEWHERE?</p><p><br></p><p>It is very simple. First, there are qualities which grow as
meditation deepens. For example, you start feeling loving for no reason
at all. Not the love that you know, in which you have to fall -- not
falling in love. But just a quality of lovingness, not only to human
beings. As your meditation deepens, your lovingness will start spreading
beyond humanity to animals, to trees, even to the rocks, to the
mountains.</p><p>If you feel that something is left out of your love -- that means you
are stuck. Your lovingness should spread to the whole existence. As your
meditation goes higher, your lower qualities will start dropping. You
cannot manage both. You cannot be angry as easily as you have always
been. Slowly, slowly, it becomes impossible to be angry. You cannot
deceive, cheat, exploit, in any way. You cannot hurt. Your behavior
pattern will be changing with your inner consciousness change.</p><p>You will not fall into those sad moments that you usually fall into
-- frustrations, failures, sadness, a feeling of meaninglessness,
anxieties, anguish; all these are slowly, slowly, going to become
foreigners.</p><p>A moment comes when even if you want to be angry, you will find it
impossible; you have forgotten the language of anger. Laughter will
become easier. Your face, your eyes, will be aglow with some inner
light. You will feel yourself that you have become light, as if
gravitation does not function as it used to function before. You have
lost heaviness, because all these qualities are very heavy -- anger,
sadness, frustration, cunningness. All these feelings are very heavy.
You don't know, but they are making you heavy-hearted and they also make
you hard.</p><p>As meditation grows you will feel yourself becoming soft, vulnerable
-- just as laughter will become easy to you, tears will also become easy
to you. But these tears will not be of sadness or sorrow. These tears
will be of joy, blissfulness; these tears will be of gratitude, of
thankfulness. These tears will say what words cannot; these tears will
be your prayers.</p><p>And for the first time you will know that tears are not only to
express your pain, your misery, your suffering; that's how we have used
them. But they have a far greater purpose to fulfill: they are immensely
beautiful when they come as an expression of ecstasy.</p><p>And you will find, on the whole, expansion -- that you are expanding,
you are becoming bigger and bigger. Not in the sense of the ego but in
the sense that your consciousness is spreading, that it is taking people
within its area, that your hands are becoming bigger and hugging far
away people, that distances are falling away, that even far away stars
are close, because your consciousness now has wings.</p><p>And these things are so clear and so certain that a question or doubt
never arises. If a doubt arises that means you are stuck; then be more
alert, then put forth your energy more intensively in meditation. But if
these things come without any question.â¦</p><p>This is a strange world: if you are miserable, if you are suffering,
nobody says to you that somebody has brainwashed you, somebody has
hypnotized you. But if you are smiling, joyously dancing on the street,
singing a song, people will be shocked. They will say, "What are you
doing? Somebody has brainwashed you -- are you hypnotized, or have you
gone mad?"</p><p>In this strange world suffering is accepted as natural. Anguish is
accepted as natural. Why? Because whenever you are in suffering and
whenever you are miserable you make the other person feel happy that he
is not so miserable, he is not so unhappy. You give him a chance to show
sympathy to you, and sympathy costs nothing.</p><p>But if you are so blissful, so happy, then that man cannot feel
himself happier than you; you are putting him down. He feels something
is wrong with him. He has to condemn you, otherwise he has to think
about himself, which he is afraid</p><p>to do. Everybody is afraid to think about himself because that means
changing, transforming, going through some processes.</p><p>It is easy to accept people with sad faces, it is very difficult to
accept people with laughter. It should not be so. In a better world, in
a world with more conscious people, it should not be so, it should be
just the opposite -- that when you are suffering people will start
asking you, "What is the matter, what has gone wrong?" And when you are
happy and you are dancing by the side of the road, if somebody passes by
he may join you, he may dance with you, or he may at least feel happy
seeing you dance. But he will not say you are mad, because dancing is
not mad, singing is not mad, joy is not mad; misery is mad. But madness
is accepted.</p><p>With your meditation developing you have to be aware that you will be
creating so many critics around you who will say, "Something is going
wrong with you. We have seen you smiling when you were sitting alone.
Why were you smiling? This is not sane. "To be sad is sane, but to be
smiling, that is not sane.</p><p>People will find it hard if they insult you and you don't react. You
simply say</p><p>`thank you' and go on your way. This is hard to take because it
deeply insults the person's ego. He wanted to drag you down into the
gutter and you refused; now he is alone in the gutter. He cannot forgive
you.</p><p>So if these things start happening you can be certain you are on the
right path. And soon people of understanding, people of experience, will
start finding the changes in you. They will start asking you what has
happened to you, how it has happened to you. "We would also like it to
happen to us." Who wants to be miserable? Who wants to remain
continuously in inner torture?</p><p>As your meditation deepens all these things are going to happen:
somebody will condemn you, somebody will think you are mad, somebody who
has some understanding will ask you, "What has happened to you and how
can it happen to me?"</p><p>You remain centered, rooted, grounded in your being -- whatsoever
happens around does not matter. You have to become the center of the
cyclone. And you will know when you have become the center of the
cyclone. There is no need to ask, "How will we know?" How do you know
when you have a headache? You simply know.</p><p>One of my teachers in school was a very strange man. The first day in
his class he said to us, "Remember one thing: headache I don't believe,
stomachache I don't believe, I believe only things which I can see. So
if you want freedom from school any day, don't make the excuse of a
headache, a stomachache, et cetera; you have to bring something real to
show me."</p><p>And he was thought to be a very strict man. It was very difficult to
get even one hour's leave. Just in front of his house there were two
kadamba trees -- very beautiful trees. At evening time he used to go for
a walk and it would be almost dark when he was returning.</p><p>So the first day I said, "It has to be settled." I climbed one of the
trees and when he came underneath the tree, I dropped a stone on his
head. He screamed, shouted. I came down. I said, "What is the
matter?"</p><p>He said, "It hurts, and you are asking what is the matter"</p><p>I said, "You have to show it. Unless you show it to me I am not going
to believe it. I am your student! And never mention this to anybody -- I
don't want you tomorrow to call me to the principle's office because you
will be in trouble. You will have to show your hurt, you will have to
put it on the table, otherwise it is just fiction; you have invented it;
it is imagination. Why should I climb the tree in front of your house? I
have never done that in my whole life. Suddenly have I gone mad?"</p><p>He said, "Listen, I understand what you want me to understand, but
don't tell anybody. If you have a headache I will accept it, but don't
tell anybody because that is my lifelong principle. I am making an
exception."</p><p>I said, "That's okay. I don't bother about anybody else. Just
understand that when I raise my hand, either it is a headache, or it is
a stomachache -- something invisible. You have to let me go."</p><p>The whole class was surprised: "What is the matter? The moment you
move your hand, he simply says 'Get out! Get out immediately!' And the
whole day you are free from his torture. But what is the significance of
that hand movement, what does it mean? And why does he get so
affected?"</p><p>You will know; it is far deeper than a headache, and far deeper than
a stomachache, far deeper than heartache. It is soul-ache; you will know
it.</p><p><br></p><p>ARE WITNESSING AND SENSITIVITY TWO SIDES OF THE SAME COIN?</p><p><br></p><p>They are not two sides of the same coin -- witnessing and
sensitivity. But sensitivity is one of the qualities that develops in
you with witnessing. Other qualities also develop. With witnessing you
become almost a garden -- many flowers and many fragrances develop in
you.</p><p>Witnessing becomes your very base of transformation. The more you see
your mind, the more you witness it, the less you will find it. It needs
unconsciousness to be there. It is an animal that exists only in
darkness. As you bring the light in, the mind with its thoughts starts
disappearing.</p><p>And it is the thickness of thoughts that makes you insensitive. When
there are no thoughts and you are simply a witness, just a mirror, then
your sensitivity is infinite. Then anything that comes in front of you
is reflected totally. Then you see the same rose flower with a totally
different vision: then it becomes radiant, then it radiates not only
color but rays. Then it becomes not only just matter but an energy
phenomenon.</p><p>In the Soviet Union one scientist photographer, Kirlian, has been
taking photographs of the energy that surrounds everything. He has
developed such sensitive plates that when you take the photograph of a
rose flower you also find</p><p>in the photograph an aura of light surrounding it. It is the same
with photographs of man, and every man has a different color aura. So
the ancient idea of auras is now finding a scientific support.</p><p>The enlightened man will have a white aura. A man like Adolf Hitler
or Joseph Stalin will have a black aura, and between these two -- black
and white auras -- will be the whole humanity. Different colors,
sometimes mixed colors, and all those colors show where you are, where
you are inside.</p><p>When you become a witness you become a sensitive mirror, more
sensitive than Kirlian's photoplates. You will see things in a totally
new light -- the same things, the same world, but in a totally different
light. Ordinary things start having extraordinary beauty. Just pebbles
on the shore become more valuable, more charming, than any Kohinoor --
because it all depends how you see them. If you can see their aura,
their light, their color, their beauty, then they are no more just
stones -- they have become flowers.</p><p>And as you become more and more sensitive you will have an
understanding of people which you never had before. Just seeing the face
of a man you will be seeing much more than the man himself knows about.
Just holding the hand of a man you will know much more of his energy
than he has ever known. Being with someone you will find that your
energy is being sucked and you feel tired -</p><p>- just being with him. And with somebody else you feel you are
nourished, you feel healthier, you feel more well-being.</p><p>Different people will give you different experiences, and different
people will become attracted to you as your awareness grows. Then only
the better quality people will be coming closer to you.</p><p>It is true that a man can be known by his friends, by the company he
keeps. It is absolutely true, because you cannot keep company which is
not in tune with your inner being.</p><p>With your witnessing there will be a few difficulties: your old
friends may not remain your friends any more, not that you have done any
harm to them but simply you have changed and now you no longer fit with
their state, with their consciousness. So don't be worried about that.
If you are married and you find that your wife is falling far away from
you then it is better to tell her what you are doing: that if she wants
to be with you, if she loves you the way you love her, you would like
her also to be a companion on the path of meditation. Otherwise, soon
you will be so far away from each other that everything will be
misunderstood.</p><p>Your children will find that you are a different person -- you are no
more the same old papa. It is better to help your children to learn a
little bit of witnessing. And don't think that they cannot learn; they
can learn better than grown up people because they are fresh, they are
not loaded with any past. Just you have to be more friendly with them
than fatherly. And before the rift happens it is better to make it clear
to them, "It will not be my fault if the family falls apart. I have</p><p>chosen a path which is going to give me something and I would like it
to be shared by you all."</p><p>I don't want any family to be disturbed by anybody in the name of
spirituality, and if we can be a little more loving and compassionate
and make them understand -- and they will be able to see that you are
less angry, you are less tired, you are less frustrated, you are more
loving, more compassionate -- they will surely come with you.</p><p>The old religions have been teaching `renounce the family.' This was
one of the reasons -- because there is going to be difficulty sooner or
later -- but I don't think that even giving it a try, you renounce the
family.</p><p>I say to you it is a good training school -- the family -- and if you
cannot change your children and your wife who love you, then whom are
you going to change in this world? You will find more and more strangers
everywhere.</p><p>Start wherever you are. And if you are finding something of
tremendous value, share it with everybody.</p><p>None of my sannyasins has renounced the family. And every sannyasin
has found a tremendous support by the family. They have become closer,
they have become friends, they have become fellow travelers.</p><h1 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:6pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=the-last-testament-vol-6-chapter-2>The Last Testament, Vol 6

LIFE -- FOR THE EXISTENCE OF ANYTHING AT ALL?</p><p>A: First it is not right to make religion and philosophy synonymous.
They are two totally different things.</p><p>Philosophy is thinking about life, its purpose, its goal, but it is
only thinking. Religion is living it, not thinking.</p><p>The difference is as great as: you are thinking about food, delicious
food, and that you are eating it. Thinking cannot quench your hunger --
it is only eating that is going to help.</p><p>Philosophy is a futile exercise of the mind -- it leads nowhere.</p><p>Secondly, the moment you divide philosophy and religion the question
takes a different shape. Now it becomes: what is the purpose of your
religion?</p><p>The very idea of purpose is valid in a philosophical investigation.
That idea does not belong to religion at all.</p><p>Religion is living. Living totally, living intensely, without any
purpose because purpose is always in the future and living is always in
the present. If you have a purpose to live your life is divided between
present and future -- you cannot be total. And without being total you
cannot experience what life is.</p><p>The only way to be total is to forget all about purpose. It is a
meaningless question. It leads only to a logical regress. If it is said
that `A' is the purpose of life then the question will remain `what is
the purpose of A?' The question is not dissolved. If `B' is the purpose
of `A' then the question will simply shift from A to B.</p><p>Finally and ultimately, one has to understand that there is no
purpose to life or to existence... and there is no need either.</p><p>It is perfectly beautiful to have no purpose and live totally, enjoy
totally, relax in the moment totally. It will take you to the peaks of
ecstasy -- but that is not the purpose of life, it is just a byproduct
of total living.</p><p>It is a little bit difficult. It will lead -- I repeat again -- to
ultimate ecstasy. But that is not the goal. If you make it a goal you
will never reach it. It is not a purpose. If you make it a purpose then
you are cut off from it forever because purpose and goal all exist in
future and you have to live in the present.</p><p>And present and future never meet.</p><p>So you have divided yourself into two halves which are not going to
meet. So I will not say that ecstasy is the purpose or the goal. I will
say, `when you live intensely, totally in the present, without any
purpose and without any goal, ecstasy happens as a byproduct of total
living.'</p><p>Q: BHAGWAN, WHY DOES SUFFERING EXIST IN THE WORLD?</p><p>A: The suffering exists in the world because of purposes, goals and
things like that. The suffering simply means you are split, torn apart
-- you are in such a situation that you can never be one whole, you can
never be an organic unity.</p><p>Suffering disappears the moment you drop purposes, goals -- ends. And
you start living moment to moment. There is no tomorrow and there is no
future.</p><p>Time means now.</p><p>And space means here. All suffering disappears.</p><p>But because the so-called leaders of the world, thinkers,
philosophers, theologians -- they are all giving you great ideals to be
achieved, great goals to be reached; they have managed humanity to
suffer forever. Those ideals, those goals, those ends are the causes of
suffering and your so-called great religious political, social leaders
are the criminals who have created the whole phenomenon of dividing
man.</p><p>But it has been done with such sophistication, perhaps they
themselves are not aware what they are doing. They may be suffering
themselves.</p><p>Q: BHAGWAN, WHAT IS THE GOAL OF YOUR RELIGION OR PHILOSOPHY, NIRVANA
OR HEAVEN ET CETERA? CAN YOU DESCRIBE THIS GOAL OR ULTIMATE REALITY?</p><p><br></p><p>A: There is no goal. The question of describing it does not arise.
There is certainly a byproduct of total living which can be indicated
at.</p><p>It is absolute contentment, fulfillment, coming to one's realization
of all the potentials that were in the seed form, now they are all have
come to be flowers. A great fragrance, a tremendous insight and clarity
into things, absolute silence and peace, no desire, nowhere to go...
everything is so calm and quiet there is no question, no word at all --
it is a wordless blissfulness.</p><p>But it is not a goal that I am describing. I hate the word goal.</p><p>It is good when you are playing football, then you can have goal and
goalkeepers, but don't make life a game of football. Life is not a game.
This has created a great problem for human beings because whenever
somebody has lived totally they had seen the beauty, the rejoicing, the
peacefulness, the</p><p>tremendous quality of contentment. Seeing this they have made it a
goal. They thought that this is the goal to be achieved. And this was
only a byproduct.</p><p>But for the outsiders it became a goal and they started striving for
contentment, for desirelessness, for fulfilment, for silence, for peace,
for ecstasy, for nirvana... and those people have never reached. Not a
single person who has made these things as goals has ever reached. It is
enough proof that in the whole history of humanity not a single
exception exists.</p><p>The people who have reached are those who never bothered about goals,
who never bothered about reaching somewhere, they were simple people,
loving people, loved life for its own sake, no other purpose.</p><p>And to love life for its own sake can be described my way of
life.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BHAGWAN, HOW DID THE UNIVERSE COME TO EXIST, AND WHY?</p><p><br></p><p>A: It never came to exist, it has always been there. So the question:
how it came to exist does not arise.</p><p>And because it has always been there, the question of why is also
irrelevant. Whom to ask? How to find?</p><p>It has always been there, and it will be always there. It is simply
there.</p><p>These questions are invented by your so-called philosophers which if
reduced to reality are more foolosophers than philosophers. Because they
can't see a simple point, a simple logical point, that if you say how
the existence came into being, any answer is not going to satisfy.</p><p>Each answer will create the same question again.</p><p>It will lead you to an absurdity in logical terms. Seeing that every
question will bring an answer, but the question will not move even a
single inch, you can go on finding other answers -- the question remains
the same.</p><p>It simply shows that the question is wrong. Otherwise some answer
would have been suitable. And you cannot conceive any answer that can be
suitable about: how this existence, why this existence?</p><p>Hence the people who had a clarity -- not thinkers, thinkers are the
most clouded people, they don't have any clarity. But people of
meditation who had absolute clarity, no thinking, they could see
immediately which question is relevant and which question is
irrelevant.</p><p>Even to answer an irrelevant question is not good because that shows
that you are not clear, that you cannot see clearly that your answer
will again help the same question to crop up. So I seem(*) existence
find it(*) it have not. It has always been here. It has never been
created. It will always be here.</p><p>The forms may change but the essential reality into those forms
continues. It is a continuum -- absolute continuum.</p><p>This also helps you to get rid of god which is a heavy burden -- a
pain in the neck. The idea of god helps nobody and tortures millions of
people. Devil has never tortured so many people. But the idea of god has
made people torture</p><p>themselves. And the idea of god is simply invented, invented because
of these questions.</p><p>I could see it even as a small child because just by the side of my
house there was a temple, a Hindu temple and people were worshipping and
priests were worshipping and I used to play in that temple and ask the
priest, that "What kind of game is this that you go on playing? Because
there is nobody, just a stone sculptured in the shape of a man; and you
are praying and you are kneeling down and tears are flowing, great
emotion, great sentimentality and I don't see a single tear on the other
side. On the other side there is nobody, just a stone."</p><p>And they will say, "Don't say things like that. It is not a stone. It
is God who created the world. Without God the world cannot exist.
Something is necessarily needed. If it exists, then there must be a
creator."</p><p>And finally they prohibited me to enter in the temple. Because I
asked them, that "If that is true, then who created God, because he
exists according to you. So you must have the guts to ask, `Who created
God?'"</p><p>And they were so angry that they simply, virtually threw me out of
the temple and told me never to come in. I said, "But this is not the
answer. It simply shows you don't have any answer and if God can exist
without being created then what is wrong in the existence to exist
without being created."</p><p>If you have to accept at some point that a thing can be without any
creator then why go into unnecessary hypotheses. Then why not remain
with the reality which is not a hypothesis?</p><p>Q: BHAGWAN, WHAT LIES BEYOND DEATH? WHAT IS IT THAT EXISTS -- THE
SOUL, ATMAN -- CAN YOU DESCRIBE IT?</p><p><br></p><p>A: There is no death, only a change of form. Everything
continues.â¦</p><p>The water that is constituting you, almost eighty percent or more,
goes to the water. The mud that is constituting you, goes to the
mud.</p><p>All the elements that constitute you go to their original sources.
Your consciousness moves on into a new body. You can call it soul, you
can call it atman.</p><p>The old body was no more capable as a house to be lived in so you
simply move in a new house and you continue moving into new houses till
any kind of desire remains in you.</p><p>The moment all desires disappear, the moment you live so totally that
all desires are consumed by your living, that you simply live without
any desire, without any ambition, without any goal, then the material
elements move into material elements and your consciousness moves into
the universal consciousness.</p><p>Nothing dies.</p><p>Only combinations disperse.</p><p>And they constitute another body for you. Existence is very
compassionate -- it goes on giving you new bodies, new forms, until you
have learned the lesson. And the lesson is to live so totally that there
is no space for any desire. Then you are allowed to be part of the
universal consciousness.</p><p>This universal consciousness is not separate from existence. It is
part, intrinsic part of existence. Existence is one. Matter and
consciousness are two extremes of one energy. Matter is a certain
combination of the same energy as consciousness. It is the same cloth
out of which all kinds of clothes are made -- your shirts, your caps,
your pyjamas, everything. According to your need.</p><p>But the cloth, the basic reality, is one.</p><p>And death is just a misconception, a misunderstanding.</p><p>It always happen to others. That's the reason why you are having a
misunderstanding.</p><p>It is always somebody else who dies. You never die. So the question
arises `what is death?' And the moment you will die, if you are living
with all kinds of desires, unfulfilled ambitions, then the possibility
is the process of death will happen but you will be unconscious. That
too is the compassion of existence.</p><p>Just like a surgeon will give you anesthesia before surgery,
existence gives you a coma before it separates your elements and changes
the whole structure and gives you a new being, a new form.</p><p>But nothing dies.</p><p>Death is as much a lie as God is.</p><p>So when I first read Frederick Nietzsche's statement that `God is
dead' I said that this is such a small statement but having too biggest
lies in it -- God and death.</p><p>Q: BHAGWAN, HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THE NEED AND EXISTENCE OF SO MANY
RELIGIONS?</p><p><br></p><p>A: There are so many religions because there are so many imaginative
people in the world. If there was clarity in people's minds, there would
not be a single religion. Then religion would not be needed at all.</p><p>It is the imagination that creates religions.</p><p>Because these questions haunt the mind of anybody who does not know
anything beyond the mind. The mind is full of questions, curiosities --
it wants some answers. Even if they are false, it is a solace. Not to
have any answers is very difficult.</p><p>To accept one's ignorance is against man's ego.</p><p>So it would rather accept any stupid answer rather than say that "I
don't know"... it hurts. It wants to claim that it knows. It covers up
all the questions that are haunting him -- who created the world, why he
created the world, when he created the world?</p><p>Now it is just a question of your imagination how you manage to
answer these questions. Each religion has its own imagination. That is
the only difference</p><p>between all religions. They are not based in truth because truth
cannot have so many religions.</p><p>It is different climates, different people, different ages, and
different imaginations.</p><p>For example, there are tribes, ancient tribes, which have remained
still attached to their old pattern, they have not changed, they are
still dominated by women not by men. The matriarchal aboriginals; their
god is a woman, obviously... because if the society is dominated by
women how can a man be god?</p><p>And in fact, the god is the imagination of the woman, the powerful
one. The woman is the priestess, the woman decides all the rituals.
Naturally the god is a woman.</p><p>And then there are societies which are made by man, dominated by
man... they cannot accept God as a woman. God has to be a man. Simply
the male chauvinist, but a natural imagination.</p><p>Whoever is in power will decide who is the god.</p><p>Different cultures, different societies and different religions have
different ideas of their heaven, their hell, and it is all
imaginative.</p><p>I have seen in India in the temples, there used to be -- I don't know
whether they still are there or have been removed -- but in my childhood
I have seen in temples maps hanging showing where is hell, where is
heaven, where is God's house, where is Devil's house.â¦ And these people
who had made these maps had no idea of the map of the world, in which we
live, because you cannot imagine it you have to know it otherwise soon
your imagination will be proved false.</p><p>They did not have any map of the world, but they had maps of heaven
and hell -- exact. And nobody can challenge, because there is no way to
prove it or disprove it. But they all had descriptions which show
something of themselves, not about heaven and hell.</p><p>The Tibetan hell is eternally ice cold -- there is a rare hell,
because all the hells are full of fire and people are being burned. But
in Tibetan hell it is eternal ice that never melts and you are thrown
into the ice. Because Tibet has suffered so much from ice, finding some
fire in hell would be impossible -- you cannot find any fire there.</p><p>Yes in their heaven, it is warm, fire is available, it never gets
cold, because it is their climate that is giving them a certain
imagination.</p><p>The Indian heaven is not warm, it is almost air-conditioned. They had
no word like air-conditioner in those ancient days, but the description
is that just as in the early morning cool air blows, the whole day it is
the same -- the cool air. India has suffered much from heat, naturally
for saints cool air is needed and fire is needed for sinners.</p><p>These are all man made conceptions. All the religions are rooted in
imagination, in dreaming. They are nothing to do with facts, nothing to
do with truth. That's why there are so many. There are three hundred
religions in the world. Perhaps</p><p>it is impossible to imagine anything more... three hundred religions
may have exhausted all possibilities of imaginations, that's why the
number has stopped there. But they are all false. Their manyness is a
proof of their falsity.</p><p>Q: BHAGWAN, WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF RELIGION DID NOT EXIST?</p><p>A: It will be just far out.â¦</p><p>Life would be a real joy, without any guilt.</p><p>People will be more authentic, more sincere, in living and in every
aspect of their being.</p><p>Religion has made them hypocrites. It has given them masks to bear.
It has hidden their original faces.</p><p>If there was no religion people will have their originality, their
original faces, their sincerity, their uniqueness. And they will be
playful about everything, there will be no seriousness. All seriousness
is created by religions.â¦</p><p>Asking questions which are absurd, then answering those questions,
then forcing people, conditioning people to accept those false answers
for false questions -- they have destroyed humanity tremendously. They
have destroyed your freedom, they have destroyed your joy, they have
destroyed your laughter, they have destroyed as much as nobody else.
These religions have been a curse, not</p><p>a blessing.</p><p>If there were no religions life will be a real blessing and my whole
effort is that there should be no religions and man should be left alone
with his reality and the reality of existence, without all these
pretenders, prophets, saviors, messiahs.â¦</p><p>It will bring a great newness to a life which seems to be dull, a
freshness to a life which these people have made a sin. It will bring
songs to people's heart, it will be possible again to dance under the
stars for no reason at all. just because it is</p><p>so beautiful to dance, so beautiful to sing, so beautiful to love, so
beautiful to live.</p><p>The burden on the heart put by these religions is Himalayan.</p><p>It is a miracle that man has still survived. somehow, he goes on
creeping under</p><p>the burden, but he has survived. But it is only survival, it is not
life.</p><p>Q: BHAGWAN, ANOTHER QUESTION: WHAT IS IMPORTANT TO YOU?</p><p><br></p><p>A: It depends on each moment.</p><p>I cannot give a wholesale answer to it because that means again I am
proposing a philosophy, again making a religion that `this is important
for me and this will be important for me tomorrow too.'</p><p>It changes.â¦</p><p>While I am taking a bath, the shower is important. While I am talking
to you, talking to you is important.</p><p>While I am eating, eating is important. While I am sleeping, sleeping
is important.</p><p>So it is very difficult for me. Everything is important at the time I
am doing it... and I don't do unimportant things.</p><p>Okay. Good Maneesha.</p><h1 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:6pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=the-last-testament-vol-6-chapter-3>The Last Testament, Vol 6

effort to stop it gives it more nourishment to go on.</p><p>Millions of people, for centuries have been trying to stop it, and
they have all failed, for the simple reason that the desire to stop it
is also part of it. It is not beyond it.</p><p>One side of the mind is desiring the other side of the mind to become
silent. This is not possible. The only way few people have been able to
stop it without making an effort to stop it, are the people who have
disidentified themselves with the mind. There is not even a desire to
stop it or to continue it, because all desires belong to it.</p><p>One simply watches it. Let it chatter. You simply become a watcher.
Let the traffic of thoughts move. There is nothing to be worried. It is
going to harm nobody. These thoughts are only soap bubbles. Don't take
them seriously. Don't become tense while watching them. Be relaxed.</p><p>I will tell you a story to understand it.</p><p>Gautam Buddha told one day, while they were passing into a
mountainous region -- it was the midday, hot sun and he was getting old
-- he told his disciple, Ananda, that "I am very thirsty. You should go
back. Because while we had been we had passed a small current of the
mountainous water, few bullock carts have passed through the current,
making it muddy. Dead leaves, which may have rested in the bed, are
floating over the water, It was not worth drinking. And particularly for
Gautam Buddha he could not take that water.</p><p>He knew that, if he goes ahead, where he had left Gautam Buddha, then
five miles ahead of that place there is a big river and he can find good
crystalclear water. He came back empty-handed.</p><p>Buddha was very strict. He said, "You go back and you bring that
water, because I remember when we had passed, it was so pure and so
crystalclear." But Ananda said, "You should understand me. In the
meantime some bullock carts have passed." Buddha said, "I understand,
but you go sit by the side of the bank -- however long it takes. You
just go and sit there. Don't get into the current, because your getting
into the current will make it muddy again. You simply</p><p>wait, watching, doing nothing. All those dead leaves will be taken
away. The mud will settle down. Then you fill the begging bowl and come
back."</p><p>Ananda wanted to go ahead towards the river, but he could not disobey
Gautam Buddha. Unwillingly, he went back -- but he was for a great
surprise. By the time he reached there, the miracle has already
happened. The dead leaves had moved with the current, and the mud has
already settled. And the water was as clean and as pure as it could
be.</p><p>Taking that bottle back, he tried to figure out why Gautam Buddha
insisted, because he never does anything without some purpose behind it,
some meaning behind it. And then he realized on the way, that it is a
message to him, that "Ananda, don't get into the river, into the current
of the mind. That's what you have been doing all your life. Just wait on
the bank, and simply watch.</p><p>It is one of the secrets of inner life, that as your watcher becomes
more and more strong, the thoughts become less and less. It is exactly
in proportion. When there are hundred percent thoughts in the mind, you
have zero watcher. When you have ten percent consciousness involved in
watching, ten percent of your thoughts will disappear -- because it is
the same energy that creates thoughts, that creates the watcher.</p><p>When you are hundred percent a watcher, a pure witness, a mirror, all
thoughts disappear. You cannot stop them, but you can manage a
situation, a device in which they get stopped. They simply
disappear.</p><p>And to know such a state, when you are aware and alert, fully
conscious and watchful and there are no thoughts there, your whole
consciousness for the first time in your life returns back on itself.
Becomes aware of awareness. You become conscious of consciousness.</p><p>In the silence, when the chattering mind is no more there, one
realizes oneself. Unless the mind is silent, you cannot realize
yourself. You will remain involved with the thoughts and those thoughts
are almost meaningless -- memories, fragments of memories, imagination,
dreams, daydreams, all mixed up. It is a chaos. Even if sometimes you
find some beautiful thoughts moving, they are all borrowed. You have
heard them, you have read them, but they are not yours. And that which
is not yours is not true.</p><p>This has to be remembered. Everything borrowed is untrue. Only your
own realization can give you authentic truth. You can recite the whole
Bible or the Koran or Dhammapada -- it does not matter. You are simply
being a parrot, and sometimes even worse than a parrot.</p><p>I have heard about a bishop whose pet parrot has died, and he was
missing the parrot very much. It was such a religious parrot. He used to
repeat the whole sermon on the mount. And it was such a joy for anybody
to come and listen to the parrot, so he went to the biggest petshop and
wanted some religious kind, some spiritual parrot. The shopkeeper said,
"What are you talking about? Parrots and spiritual?"</p><p>He said, "Yes. I had one, and with great effort made him learn the
whole sermon on the mount, and he used to repeat it with perfection."
The shopkeeper said, "Now I ko understand what you mean by spiritual.
You mean the parrot who can repeat scriptures. I have something for you
you would love."</p><p>He took him inside the shop. He said. "It is a very special parrot
and I was keeping it for myself -- but you are in such a desperate need
and you are missing your own parrot which is dead, I will be happy to
give it to you.</p><p>Before you take it, let me introduce you about its qualities. Just
watch and you will see one thread hanging by its right leg, another
thread hanging by his left leg. The threads are very thin. Nobody can
see them unless one comes very close. You have just to pull the thread
of the right leg and he will repeat the sermon on the mount."</p><p>"But sometimes you may be having a visitor, who is not a Christian.
Then you have to pull the left leg. Then he repeats a beautiful portion,
in pure Sanskrit, of Srimad Bhagavat Gita."</p><p>The bishop was enchanted to find such a rare parrot. He asked the
shopkeeper, "And if I pull both the threads together?" Before the
shopkeeper was going to say anything, the parrot said, "You idiot. I
will fall on my ass. Never do that!"</p><p>Even parrots are more intelligent that your bishops, your pandits,
your rabbis. Even the parrot said, "This is absolute stupidity."</p><p>But for centuries people have used their mind almost like a parrot,
and have thought that they are spiritual, that they are religious. Now
all that can be done by a computer more perfectly, but a computer is not
religious, not spiritual. Neither you are, just by repeating words from
scriptures. Don't be a His Master's gramophone record!</p><p>It is below humanity. And it good of the company that makes those
records, that they have chosen a dog as their symbol! His Master's
Voice. But what millions of people are doing in the world, then
repeating His Master's Voice? Their masters may be different, but the
function of the dog is the same.</p><p>The mind can stop, but not by your effort but by your effortless
witnessing. That is the whole meaning of meditation. Relax. Don't force,
and just watch. Let the mind do its things.</p><p>It will take a little patience, but it has always happened. It is
almost a scientific law, without exception, that if you can manage a
little patience you will come to a point where the watcher is nourished
and the mind becomes unnourished, and the thoughts start disappearing.
When the whole energy of your consciousness moves into watching, you
will find there is no mind at all. And to know a state of no-mind is the
greatest experience in life a man is capable of. It is ecstasy. It is
superconsciousness. It is self-realization. There is nothing higher than
that.</p><p>Q: BHAIRAVA, MY SELF, BHAGWAN</p><p>YOU ARE HERE WITH EVERYONE. YOU ARE HERE WITH EVERYDAY.</p><p>WHY CAN I THINK LIKE THIS? WHY CAN I TRUST YOU LIKE THIS? WHY CAN I
LOVE YOU LIKE THIS?</p><p><br></p><p>A: It is very simple. You can love me, because I am not a prophet. I
am not a messiah. I am not a savior. I am not an incarnation of god. You
can worship those people. You cannot love them. And worship is not
love.</p><p>Love needs that you understand one thing clearly, that I am amongst
you, that I am not superior, that you are not inferior.</p><p>For thousands of years the prophets and the messiahs and the saviors
have been telling you they are superior, you are inferior. They are
saints, you are sinners -- and the distance is so great, love is
impossible. And to prove that they are special, all kinds of inventions,
imaginary qualities have been given to those people, either by
themselves or by their followers.</p><p>For example, you cannot love Mahavira, the most important prophet of
Jainism -- for the simple reason because he is so far away. You cannot
even touch his feet. They are beyond your reach. Mahavira does not
perspire. This is absolutely stupid, because it is unnatural.
Perspiration is as absolutely needed by your body as water is needed, as
food is needed, as air is needed. And if Mahavira does not perspire, the
only possibility is that he has a plastic body.</p><p>But why this insistence upon nonsense? Because perspiration is a
defense system of your physiology. It keeps your temperature exactly the
same. Outside temperature may go on changing, but your inside
temperature has to remain the same to keep you healthy.</p><p><br></p><p>Your lifespan as far as temperature is concerned is not very big:
between ninety- eight degrees and one hundred and ten degrees. Only
twelve degrees is the span of your life. If it falls below ninety-eight
there is danger. If it goes above one hundred ten there is danger. Your
temperature should be kept constantly the same. Perspiration does a
miracle. When it is too hot, you perspire. It is an effort of the body
to make an arrangement with the sun, that the sun will get engaged in
evaporating the perspiration, and its heat will not reach within you. It
will be prevented by perspiration.</p><p>You don't perspire when it is cold. When it is cold, you shiver. That
keeps your body warm. Shivering is keeping the body warm. Your
temperature cannot fall below.</p><p>Even you may start chattering your teeth. That too is an effort to
keep your body warm, so your temperature remains the same and the cold
is prevented outside. It is absolutely medically, scientifically
impossible that Mahavira never perspired.</p><p>But it is not the only special thing about him. His disciples for
twenty-five centuries have been repeating he does not urinate. He does
not defecate. I can understand it looks a little odd to see Mahavira
sitting on a toilet, or Krishna or Rama or Jesus Christ. It seems weird,
embarrassing.</p><p>But nobody has prevented it. Jainas have completely prevented
Mahavira. He is the most constipated man in the whole history of the
world. The greatest record is done by an Englishman who has remained
constipated for eight months continuously. That is nothing compared to
Mahavira. He remained for eighty years!</p><p>But all these irrational ideas are imposed on all your prophets and
saviors, for the simple reason: to create a distance between you and
them. It is humiliation of humanity. It is a direct insult of all human
beings. If you had the guts, you would have rejected these people long
ago before.</p><p>Jesus walks on water. He raises dead people back to life. All these
things are not possible. Nature never allows any exception.</p><p>But the followers would like to make their prophet higher than other
prophets. They will create some imaginary qualities, and will make it
absolutely necessary that unless these qualities are there, a man is not
a prophet.</p><p>I have heard about an American, a very rich man, who had gone to
Jerusalem. Jerusalem is very special. It is a sacred place for the Jews.
It is a sacred place for Christians. It is a sacred place for
mohammedans.</p><p>He went to the lake Galilee where Jesus used to walk on water. The
boatman asked him, that he can take him to all the places around the
lake and show him where "our lord used to walk on water." He said,
"First things first. How much it will cost?" The man said, "Not much.
Just ten dollars." Seeing that he is an American, ten dollars is nothing
-- although that was not the usual rate. He was asking ten times
more.</p><p>The American was a real miser. He said, "Now I know why our lord
Jesus Christ used to walk on water! Ten dollars! I have seen enough of
lake Galilee. That's enough. And I don't know how to walk on water, and
I don't want to waste ten dollars. But upto now I had never understood
why he used to walk on Lake Galilee. You have answered me."</p><p>All these people, we have allowed, helped, accepted, recognized that
they are special beings. And this has been one of the most harmful
things to humanity. Because once you accept that you are an ordinary
human being and they are incarnations of god -- somebody is the only
begotten son of god, somebody is a special messenger of god. If they can
meditate, if they can realize themselves, it is understandable. But how
can we do it?</p><p>The distance between the prophets and you has not allowed you to love
those people, has not allowed you to respect yourself. It has destroyed
your self- respect and it has kept you in misery and anguish, because a
natural conclusion, a logical conclusion that we are ordinary human
beings and these things are not possible for us. We cannot walk on water
and we cannot raise the dead back to life, so we have to accept our
misery, our suffering, our anguish.</p><p>You may not have thought it in this way, but this is how I look at
the whole miserable humanity. This is the creation of your so-called
special prophets and saviors. If they had just a little more respect
towards ordinary human beings, if</p><p>they had accepted -- which was the truth -- that they are part of
you, and they are exactly like you and whatever they have attained is
your potential, you can attain it too -- the world would have been
totally different. Then we would not have remembered Gautam Buddha
perhaps. We would not have remembered Krishna and Mohammed and Jesus
perhaps. Because there would have been so many people of the same
quality, of the same awareness, that there would have been no need
especially to recognize and remember them. I would like it to happen
some day. We remember Gautam Buddha only because for twenty-five
centuries we have not been able to produce the same consciousness, the
same intensity of life, again. If millions of people can do it, Gautam
Buddha will be lost. There is no need to divide history by Christ. He
becomes a milestone.</p><p>Before Jesus Christ and after Jesus Christ, that's how we divide our
history. But there was no need, if there were many, many people who had
the same quality of love, of compassion, who had experienced the same
beauty and the same immortality.</p><p>Jesus Christ would have lost into a big crowd of conscious people. I
hope a day will come we will not need to remember Gautam Buddha,
Mahavira, Krishna, Jesus Christ -- and all the other prophets, because
it will become an ordinary, simple, human experience. That is my basic
approach.</p><p>You can love me. Don't be surprised by it. I love you too. More than
you can love me. Because I am not superhuman. I also perspire when it is
hot. And in a cold night, I also cannot sleep without a blanket.</p><p>There is no distance between you and me. There is a little bit of
difference, but not of distance. I am aware. You have to be aware. The
difference may be of time, but not of status. It is within your reach to
become aware. It is your responsibility to become aware, so even that
difference is dissolved.</p><p>Every master in the world should dream of the day, when all the
disciples turn into masters and there is no need for any distinction to
be made. So don't be surprised. Please accept me as an ordinary human
being, exactly like you. I was also groping in darkness. I was also in
the same space in which you are.</p><p>It was my yesterday. It is your today -- but it can change. Tomorrow
you can be in the same space where I am.</p><p>It is our birthright. Self-realization is our only birthright --
which no government can prevent, which no imprisonment can prevent,
which no communism can prevent, which no fascism can prevent. All our
rights can be taken away, but the right for self-realization is
indestructible -- because it is not according to any constitution.
Constitutions can be changed. It is according to the very nature of
existence, which cannot be changed.</p><p><br></p><p>BELOVED BHAGWAN,</p><p>MY QUESTION IS ABOUT MY SISTER. SHE HAD AN ACCIDENT, AND SINCE THAT
SHE CAN'T MOVE, SHE CAN'T SEE, SHE CAN'T HEAR, SHE CAN'T SPEAK. HOW CAN
SHE KNOW ABOUT TRUTH? HOW CAN HER</p><p>CONSCIOUSENSS FUNCTION WITHOUT (*)? IS IT BETTER TO LET HER DIE, SO
THAT SHE CAN BE BORN WITH (*)?</p><p><br></p><p>A: It is one of the most fundamental questions, which is being raised
all around the earth in different forms. Because for centuries we have
accepted an idea, that death should be avoided. That it is something
evil. That life is given by god and death comes through the devil.</p><p>Even the medical profession of the world, every medicine graduate has
to take the Hypocrites oath, that he will not help anybody in any way to
die. He will help in every possible way to protect life.</p><p>It was right in the days of Hypocrites, because ten children were
born and only one survived to become an adult. Nine were going to die.
That was the situation. The whole world population in the times of
Gautam Buddha was so small you cannot imagine. It was only two crore.
Now India alone has ninety crore people. The whole world has now five
hundred crore people. From two crore people, in twenty-five centuries,
we have reached fo five hundred crore people. And the earth remains the
same. And the medical science has grown tremendously.</p><p>It used to be said that seventy years is at the most one can hope to
live.</p><p>For almost five thousand years, scientists have been searching for
bones, skeletons, to find out exactly how long man used to live. And
they have come to a very strange conclusion, that people were not living
more than forty years of age -- because we have not yet found a single
skeleton which were more aged when he died than forty years. So it is
right that people believe that in the past the days were so beautiful
that no father ever saw the death of his own son.</p><p>It is natural. If every father is going to die at forty, how he is
going to see the death of his own son?</p><p>But in this, those nine small children are not included, because they
lived no more than two years. Otherwise every father was seeing dozens
of his sons and daughters dying. Once a child has survived more than two
years, then there was a possibility for him to live at least forty
years. Naturally meanwhile his father will be dying.</p><p>Now there are people in the west who have passed hundred years of
age. There are people in certain parts of Soviet Union, where some
thousands of people have passed the age one hundred fifty, and some
hundreds of people have passed the age one hundred eighty. And they are
still working, they are not old. In Caucasus in Russia, you can find a
one hundred eighty year old man working in the field like any young man.
And scientists say that there is a possibility, if right food, right
exercise and right atmosphere is available, a man's body is capable to
live at least three hundred years.</p><p>That is a very dangerous prospect, because even in ninety or hundred
years time, you get so fed up with life. What are you going to do for
three hundred years? Your own generations will not recognize you. In
three hundred years so many</p><p>generations of your own children -- they will not think any
relationship with you. The gap will be too big.</p><p>And what are you going to do? You have lived, you have loved. You
have seen all that life contains, the failures, the successes; the pains
and the pleasures; the days and the nights. You have seen all the
seasons. Now there is nothing more. It is now again repetition. The same
wheel is moving.</p><p>We have to think about the whole matter of death again. My own
opinion is that if a person comes to a stage where he finds that it is
absolutely useless for him to live, he has lived enough, then it should
not be illegal. It should be absolutely permissible. In fact, every
hospital should have a special arrangement, a special department, for
those people who come to die there -- so they can die in peace, in
silence, with all medical care. This medical care is not to keep them
alive, this medical care is to help them to die as beautifully, as
silently.</p><p>My own suggestion is, every death department in a hospital should
have a meditator who can help people before they die, to learn
meditation so they can die meditatively. Their death can become an
immensely valuable experience. Perhaps more valuable than their whole
life has been. And they are not committing any sin.</p><p>You can have time to think. Perhaps they are emotionally upset at the
moment. Perhaps something has happened that has given them the idea, "It
is better to finish your life." They should be given a time, that "You
enter into the hospital, rest for one month, prepare for your death. We
will help. But if in this one month you change your mind, it is up to
you. You can get up, and get out! Nobody is forcing you."</p><p>And remember, no emotion remains more than for a few minutes. Anybody
who commits suicide, if he had waited a single minute more, may not have
committed. It is a momentary thing. But if somebody for one month
continuously enjoys, is happy, is really looking forward to death, as an
adventure, then it is our duty to allow these people to drop the body --
as gracefully as possible.</p><p>About the question, I had to give you this much introduction so that
you can understand that death is not something evil, that it is
something natural. But the question is about, not an old person. The
question is about a younger sister, who cannot move, who cannot see, who
cannot hear, who cannot speak. All her senses are absent. Now do you
call it life? This is simply vegetation.</p><p>And she must be in incredible suffering. That we cannot see, because
she cannot say. She has no doors to communicate. She is absolutely
alone, cut off from all life. What is the point of her vegetating for
seventy, eighty or ninety years -- or maybe more? She will be a burden
on the family. She will be a sadness on the family. And she herself will
be in absolute hell, because she is completely imprisoned.</p><p>Just think of yourself. There cannot be a bigger concentration camp:
your eyes are taken off, your ears are closed, your nose is closed, you
cannot speak. You will be in a coma.</p><p>There are many people. I have seen myself one woman, who was in coma
for nine months. And doctors are saying that she can never come back to
consciousness, because she has been so long unconscious that a small and
very delicate nervous system which keeps one conscious, has almost died.
They showed me x-rays of her brain, and they said that all the points
that make one self-conscious, have died. She will remain unconscious.
Perhaps for fifty years, because she was not more than thirty when I saw
her. And now she is a constant heaviness on the whole family, on the
husband, on the children. They cannot do, they are simply helpless. The
doctors cannot do anything, they are helpless. But the law prevents that
you should not help anybody to die, otherwise the doctors will be
criminals. They will be thought to be murderers.</p><p>The law is primitive. The law does not understand compassion. That
woman needs a mercy-death. She cannot ask even for her death!</p><p>The sister of the sannyasin cannot ask even for death. But those who
love her, should ask the government, whichever country you belong, you
should take her case to the court -- that to keep her alive is not
compassion. It is not love. It is absolute primitive idea, which has no
more any contemporary support for it. And the whole family is ready,
that she should be relieved from this prison, so that she can get a new
birth, a new body -- with eyes, with ears, she can talk and she can
walk. So her death will not be a calamity.</p><p>Her death will be a blessing for her.</p><p>I am simply telling you my approach. I am not telling you to act
accordingly, because that may be illegal in your county. You have to
approach through law to the government, and make it a point of national
discussion, that it may not be your sister only. There may be many other
children, suffering in the same way -- for no other reason except
because the law does not permit any medical person to help somebody to
drop the body.</p><p>It is time that we should understand and our medical profession
should understand, and the Hypocrites oath should no longer be the oath
for medical students. They should be given an oath that helps a person
to live, if he can live abundantly, more beautifully -- but if the
person cannot live and you can simply go on helping him just to
breathe.â¦ Breathing is not life. Then it is better: help him to die. In
both the cases, you are compassionate. Either you serve life or you
serve death -- it does not matter. Your compassion should see that the
person gets into a better space, into a better life.</p><p>And every country has to come to pass a law. Just as many countries
are now accepting birth control. That is one end of life. You are
preventing children from being born. If you have accepted that, on the
other end you should allow old people who want to leave the world, to
let them leave ceremoniously. They can</p><p>call all their friends, their whole family. They can live with the
whole family for one month, because now they are going to be here only
for one month.</p><p>Birth is not in your hands, but at least you can be free to chose
your death.</p><p>A little more governments in the world are going to accept soon, that
on the other end also we should allow people to move faster. Because the
world is too much crowded. On one hand we are preventing people to come.
On the other hand we should let them move, so a few move fast and the
world becomes less crowded and less poor.</p><p>And it is not a question only of the world becoming less poor and
less crowded, it is also a question of those people. Because I have seen
in hospitals and in almost all of the western countries, particularly in
America, thousands of people are simply living in hospitals. They are
ninety years or hundred years old. They cannot live in the house,
because thy cannot even breathe on their own. And still we are keeping
them alive. For what?</p><p>Artificial breathing is being given to them. I don't think it is
going to be a pleasure to those people. They will never be going back
home. They will die in the hospital.</p><p>And I don't see where is the logic, to keep them breathing
artificially. When their bodies are not ready to breathe, please let
them not breathe. That is their personal affair. You are interfering too
much.</p><p>You won't let them die. They are dead. You are forcing them to
continue. But you are not aware of any purpose. And when you are keeping
thousands of people alive, who should be resting in their graves,
unnecessary occupying places in the hospitals, the time of the doctors,
of so many machines and so much care -- and what is the purpose? After
two or three years they will even stop taking the artificial breath in.
They will refuse and reject.</p><p>Nothing else is going to happen. But for three years you will be
keeping them unnecessarily in torture. And this is thought to be
service. This is thought to be compassion. This is thought to be
Christianity. This is simply cruelty.</p><p>Let those poor people die. And there are thousands of people around
the world who are ready to leave the body, because the body is only a
pain to them. With so much disease, with so much sickness, they are no
more able to do anything. They are no more able to enjoy anything.</p><p>I have heard, in the second world war a man got a bullet into his
throat. So his food became difficult. He could not eat. Doctors managed
to fix a pipe, but he did not enjoy this because there was no taste. So
finally they decided, "First you chew it and then put it into the pipe.
Have the taste, then put it in the pipe so it goes into your
stomach."</p><p>That man is still alive and doing the same thing! He cannot do
anything else, because his body is very delicate, very much fragile. He
can die any moment, but he has lived really long. And what he is doing
seems to be simply ugly, nauseating, that first you chew your food, then
you vomit it in the pipe. Then it takes it to the stomach. Then what is
the point?</p><p>I have inquired about this man, because now it is forty years since
the pipe has been fixed. Has he been able to find a woman to love him?
And I have been informed no woman wants to be close to him. Has he got
any friends? No.Â Because just to see him, with his big pipe throwing all
kinds of bad smells out of it. Who wants to befriend to him? He is not
allowed in restaurants, because the</p><p>restaurant stars suffering from losing customers -- because seeing
him doing all that in a restaurant, who would like to eat there?</p><p>I have enquired, has the man in these forty years done anything
creative? Has he painted? Has he been writing poetry? No.Â All that he is
doing, is -- because he is almost dead, he is just living like a
ghost.â¦</p><p>It is not compassionate. And everybody feels disgusted by him. And he
cannot do anything else, because he has no energy. He is living on such
a low energy, that if the man is asked, "Would you like to die?", I
don't think he will refuse. But right now it is a very strange world. It
goes on continuing old laws, which have lost all reality, which have
become just shadows of the past, torturing humanity unnecessarily.</p><p>Had the man been asked before this whole nonsense had been done to
him? No.Â The doctors are doing their duty. They have to fulfil their
oath. The government is doing its duty. It has to fulfil the law. It
cannot allow people to commit suicide. It is a very strange government
and very strange law. All over the world. If you are going to commit
suicide, and you are caught red-handed before you commit, then the
government will so the job. They will sentence you to death, because you
are trying to commit suicide. Strange! Because that is what the man was
doing himself! Now, after two, three years of trial and harassment and
all kinds of arguments, many advocates involved, judges involved -- and
finally you come to the same decision. The poor fellow was doing it
without all this nonsense.</p><p>My suggestion is, that your sister should be released from this body,
because this body is nothing but a prison to her. If you love her, you
have to say goodbye to her. With tears, with sadness, but still you have
to say goodbye to her. And you have to meditate and pray that she gets
into a better body. But ask the government, make a movement around it,
so not only your sister is helped. There may be many other children. And
I think the sannyasin was from Japan, and in Japan there are bound to be
many children, because of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, of which the
government of America is responsible.</p><p>Those two cities, America destroyed without any reason at all. The
war was almost finished. Germany has surrendered. Now there was no
possibility for Japan to continue. It was only a question of a week, or
at the most two weeks and Japan would have to surrender. What was the
need to destroy two civilian cities, which were not fighting? Small
children, pregnant women, old people? Each city contained at least ten
lakhs people. Twenty lakhs people were destroyed within five minutes.
Those who survived are producing this kind of children. Those who have
survived are proving to be more dangerous than those who have died,
because now they are carrying radioactivity in their very bodies. Women
and</p><p>men, they will produce children which will be retarded, will be deaf,
will be dumb, can be blind -- all kinds of perversions. And this will
continue for centuries.</p><p>But America, and the president of America at the time -- whose name
is very strange: Truman! -- did such an un-true-manly act, just because
he was worried the war is going to end and before the war ended he
wanted to experiment what are going to be the results of atomic
explosion on human beings. Poor Japanese were used as guinea-pigs. And
just out of fear that the war is going to end. If the war ends, then
there is no reason to use those bombs on human beings -- so he was in a
hurry.</p><p>And it is not only human beings who get affected: the trees have
carrying radium. If you eat the fruit of those trees, you will get the
radium. And nobody knows which trees are carrying the radium. The
fishes, the birds, the animals who have survived in the area, all are
full of radium. And they have moved, because you cannot keep the fish in
the same place. You cannot imprison them. They have moved all around.
They are giving birth to new generations which will be carrying radium
for generations to come. And if you eat that fish, you become a victim.
You will carry the radium; your children will become victims.</p><p>So it is not only Hiroshima and Nagasaki that have been affected by
those two atom bombs. The whole humanity has been risked.</p><p>And for no reason at all. There was no question of defeating them.
They were ready to surrender -- because they were just following
Germany. And when the leader has surrendered, how long the followers can
fight? At the most two weeks; that is the estimate of all the military
experts of the world.</p><p>And Truman was warned, that it is absolutely unnecessary, that Japan
is going to surrender. And because of this warning he was in such a
hurry, he immediately ordered to destroy those two beautiful cities,
just for an experiment.</p><p>And that is again the problem. Now America is the greatest nuclear
power in the world, and they are the only nation who has a protective
system. Nobody can throw a nuclear missile on their land. It will be
immediately returned.</p><p>Russia is still halfway in creating its protective system. It needs
time, at least one year time, to protect itself completely. This one
year is more dangerous, because America is in a powerful position. If
America misses this one year, then there will be no question of
defeating Russia. Right now Russia can be defeated, with all its nuclear
weapons -- because those weapons will be returned back and American
weapons will fall on Russia and They cannot be returned back.</p><p>We are not aware that we are sitting on a volcano.</p><p>And the American politicians -- I have been there for five years, I
have watched closely -- are the ugliest in the world. Pretending all the
time about democracy, but there is no democracy at all. Hidden behind
the mask of democracy, is simply a fascist regime. And Ronald Reagan
will not hesitate, if he sees that within one year Russia will be equal
in power, then this time should not be lost -- because this time may not
be available again.</p><p>And people like Ronald Reagan are not very intelligent people.
Neither they have any compassion. And you cannot expect much from a man
like Ronald Reagan who was just a movie star in Hollywood -- that too of
third-rate films, cowboy films. And not very successful either. And he
has been keeping a pet animal with himself. When he became the
president, the animal was with him and went to White House. It was an
ape. It is strange, that he finds a friendship in an ape. He cannot find
friendship in human beings. And I have heard the story that when he
became the first time president, he and his ape had gone for a walk on
the beach. One man came across and said, "Mister President, can I ask
you a question? Why do you keep this ape with you?" And as Ronald Reagan
was going to speak, he said, "I'm not asking you, I'm asking Mister
President.!" He thought this is the ape, and the ape is the president!
But politicians all over the world are the same. Charles Darwin in his
whole life tried to find the missing link between apes and men, and I
wonder how he missed. He should have looked at politicians! There was no
need to go anywhere. That is the missing link. No intelligent person
wants to be a politician. And no politician can be expected to be
intelligent.</p><p>Create a movement in your country for your sister, because in Japan
there will be many children in the same position. And make as much
uproar about it, only then you will be able to be allowed, that your
sister can have a peaceful death. And don't be worried because your
innermost being never dies.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BELOVED BHAGWAN, (THIS QUESTION IS INAUDIBLE)</p><p><br></p><p>A: It is happening! And it is unbelievable! It is the most miraculous
experience. When it happens, you cannot believe it. You know it is
there. You have to believe in it. But it is so unbelievable, you had
never expected that it will happen to you. But the reason that you feel
so difficult to believe in it, is that you have been told for centuries
that it is the most difficult thing in the world -- and it is not.</p><p>You have been told that it takes many lives for it to happen. And
that's an absolute lie. It can happen in a single moment. Because you
already have it! It is just a question of becoming aware of it.</p><p>It is nothing to be achieved. Achievement takes time. It is nothing
to be invented. Invention takes time. It is something that is already
there, has always been there, within the innermost core of your being.
Just you have forgotten to go there. And you are knocking on other
people's doors to find it.</p><p>And your religions have been telling you, that it is the most
difficult thing -- for the simple reason because your priests don't know
anything about it. They are professional people. It is their profession,
not their experience. Naturally when you ask them, the only way is to
console you, to satisfy you, that "It will happen, but it takes years'
effort. You have already been here on the earth for many, many lives.
How much more they want to wait?</p><p>There is something basically wrong in their whole approach.</p><p>They are not turning you towards your own being. That is where they
are wrong. They are turning you towards a god somewhere far away. You
are already looking out in things, in money, in power, in people. That
is your mistake that you are looking out, not in. And they go on making
the same mistake greater. They tell you it is far away, that is still
out of you. It is the god in the heavens, which is simply a lie. All
that is needed is to tell you that you are the temple of god, that there
is no other temple. That if you want to go anywhere, go inside. Don't
freak out, freak in!</p><p>And it is the simplest thing in the world. To find something which
you have already got, how it can be difficult?</p><p>The last question?</p><p>Q: BELOVED BHAGWAN, (THIS QUESTION IS INAUDIBLE...)</p><p><br></p><p>A: You ask only for one joke? I am not that miserly! At least I can
tell two!</p><p>It is said, when Jesus was born he was born in a stable. Because in
Jerusalem there was a great annual festival, and Joseph and Mary -- the
father and mother of Jesus -- were very poor people. They tried hard,
but all the hotels and all the caravanserais and every possible place
was overcrowded already. There was no place to stay. They would have
stayed on the street, but the problem was that Mary, Jesus' mother, was
pregnant. It was her ninth month. She could give birth any moment. And
that very night she really gave birth to Jesus.</p><p>One kindly person, seeing the situation that the woman is pregnant
and coming close, any moment she can give birth to a child -- he had a
stable. He said, "You can share my animals if you want. That is the only
place, where I keep my horses and donkeys and cows."</p><p>In that stable, amongst the animals, Jesus was born. And the story is
that three great wise people from the east, who had been waiting for the
birth of Jesus, started moving towards the place where Jesus was born.
The story is beautiful. It says, a star moved ahead of them to show them
the path. Otherwise how they are going to find? And the star stopped on
the stable.</p><p>Those three wise people reached the stable. Of course the door of the
stable was not made for man, so it was a very small door. The first old
man, as he entered the door, hit his forehead with the door, and said,
"Jesus!"</p><p>Mary, hearing this, told Joseph, "Have you listened? This seems to be
a good name for the child." That's how Jesus got the name!</p><p>And the second story:</p><p>In an international school of small children, the Christian teacher
was insisting that Jesus Christ is the greatest one in the whole
history. And after she had spoken, in the end she asked the students,
"Can you tell me who is the greatest man of history?" One American boy
stood up and he said, "Abraham Lincoln."</p><p>The lady teacher was shocked. For one hour completely she was
insisting on Jesus Christ and this boy says, "Abraham Lincoln." But she
says, "It is good, but not good enough. You sit down." "Has somebody
else the answer?" One Indian boy stood up and said, "Mahatma Gandhi."
She said, "That too is good, but not good enough." Then a Jewish boy
raised his hand. She said, "Yes."</p><p>She was a little hesitant, because he was a Jew. And the Jewish boy
said, "There is no question about it: Jesus Christ." The lady could not
believe.</p><p>When the class was finished she caught hold of the Jewish boy and
asked him, that "You are a Jew?" He said, "Yes." "Then why you said
Jesus Christ is the greatest man in the world?" He said, "Business is
business! In the heart of my hearts I know it is Moses!"</p><p>Okay?</p><h1 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:6pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=the-last-testament-vol-6-chapter-4>The Last Testament, Vol 6

RELIGIONS?</p><p><br></p><p>ANSWER: The process of deprogramming is one of the most simple. Just
you have to watch the ideologies, philosophies, religions, that you are
carrying in your mind -- are not your own experiences. That's the
distinction to be made: what is not your own experience, you have been
programmed. Otherwise how you got it?</p><p>You are a Christian or a Hindu or a Mohammedan. How you got to be a
Christian? You have never explored. You don't have any personal
experience. Your heart will immediately say to you, that "I am
absolutely innocent of all these things." Your mind has been
programmed.</p><p>And to understand what is programmed, is to understand what is false
in you, what is borrowed in you, what has been forced upon you. This
very awareness is enough. The ideas are not clinging to you. You are
clinging to those ideas.</p><p>So it is not a question how to get rid of them. It is a question how
not to go on holding them. And the moment you see the falsity, you will
drop them. To know something as false and borrowed, is enough to drop
it.</p><p>And once you have dropped all that is borrowed in you, you are again
innocent, a tabula rasa, a clean sheet on which nothing is written. And
I don't want to write anything on it. I want you to experience and write
yourself. You are the only person who has the right to ink in
(?anything) on your being.</p><p>This is the most essential freedom. All other freedoms are just
so-so. And this essential freedom is not given to man. Political freedom
is given and social freedom is given, but they are not real freedoms. To
programmed people, there is no freedom, because they will be using the
freedom according to the program which is their bondage.</p><p>So the first and the most important thing is to get unburdened of the
bondage. And the simple distinction about everything -- you have to go
all over your mental luggage and ask, "Do you know god? Have you
experienced anything of</p><p>god?" If not, then whether god exists or not does not matter. It is
not your experience. It has no relevance to you.</p><p>And once you are a clean slate, you can go on an adventurous journey
of discovering what is the truth. But before one knows what is the
truth, one has to know what is false. Because you are so much surrounded
with the false, that you will not be able to know the truth. That is the
purpose of deprogramming: to help you clean yourself of all borrowed
knowledge enforced on you in your childhood, in your innocent moments of
life when you were not capable to doubt and question -- but now you are
capable to question and doubt. So whatever your parents, your teachers,
your churches, your priests have done -- you have to undo it.</p><p>And it is such a simple process to undo it: just like a snake
slipping out of his old skin. He never looks back. You just go on
watching each idea, and you will find they are all false because none of
them is yours -- so there is no fear, no problem that you can get
confused. What is yours and what is not yours is such a simple process,
that everybody is capable of.</p><p>Q: BHAGWAN, YOU HAVE SAID THAT PEOPLE NEED TO EXPERIENCE MATERIAL
WEALTH IN THEIR LIVES BEFORE SPIRITUAL GROWTH CAN HAPPEN. WHY THEN DO SO
MANY PEOPLE IN WEALTHY, DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, SUFFER FROM MENTAL
DISEASES?</p><p><br></p><p>A: The cause is the religions. The wealthy people in the West get
bored with their riches. They are finished with their wealth, but they
don't know where to go. And what their religions provide is false, it
leads to madness. The false cannot lead you to health. It is
dangerous.</p><p>The false may be a consolation to the poor, because he is not yet
finished with materialism. So the false religion, the churches, can
console the poor, that "You will have all these things in the future
life, in paradise, just be patient, just keep quiet. Don't be
discontent. This is a fire-test by god. Pass through it calmly, coolly."
But this cannot be a consolation to a wealthy man, because whatever your
paradise provides, more than that they already have.</p><p>This is the cause of their madness. They need some real, authentic
spirituality, which is not available to them. And your religions prevent
them from moving in directions where they can find it.</p><p>Your religions program their minds, that they go on clinging to
Christianity or Judaism or any other -ism, not knowing that except truth
there is no health and there is no wholeness and there is no freedom.
And the truth is found in meditation, not in prayers, not in churches,
not in the BIBLE, not in the KORAN. It is found when you are silent,
utterly silent. In that purity of awareness begins a totally new kind of
life, ecstatic.</p><p>Full of joy and light. Full of blessings and benediction. So it is
very clear why in the West so many wealthy people are going mad. The
Christianity or Judaism are</p><p>responsible. If the wealthy people go mad in the East, then Hinduism,
Buddhism, Jainism, Mohammedanism -- these will be responsible.</p><p>The search for truth is individual, and your churches don't allow you
individuality. They don't allow you to move alone. Their whole emphasis
is to be in the crowd. And the wealthy man is finished and bored with
the crowd. He has known all that the crowd can give, money can purchase.
He has known everything that men or women can give. That is
finished.</p><p>And you don't allow him any exit.</p><p>The pressure of remaining in a situation which is absolutely nothing
but discontent, and you don't allow him to move from there. You want him
still to be Christian, still to be a Hindu. You are driving him mad. All
the churches of the world are responsible. They have consoled the poor
to remain poor and they are preventing the rich to go on an individual
pilgrimage.</p><p>They are creating hell for both. Of course the hell for the rich is
bigger, because there is no consolation for him. Whatever they have to
offer in paradise, he has lived it so it can't be a consolation, it
can't be a hope. His material success has destroyed any possibility of
hope in your so-called paradises, heavens. Now he has to live
hopelessly, in the same church, in the same crowd. He has to be a
hypocrite. How long he can manage the tension? Sooner or later he breaks
down. All that is needed is that he should get out of the church, out of
the crowd, and out of the programming that those churches have done on
him so he can be alone. And he can move on his own in search of truth.
This world does not provide any truth, any blissfulness. And the
religions of this world are only talking, of the same pleasures in the
next world. For the wealthy it has not meaning.</p><p>He knows that even in paradise he will be discontented.</p><p>And to live in a hopeless state, where you cannot find any exit,
naturally is going to create a nervous breakdown. One of Jean-Paul
Sartre's books has the name</p><p>`No Exit', and the book describes hell. It is not the old hell, where
you are burnt into fire and you are cut into pieces and tortured. No,
there is nothing of it. It is a contemporary hell. The only thing
hellish is that there is no exit.</p><p>People are sitting in a room. They don't know why. They don't know
how long they have to sit here. They don't have any way to go out. They
are bored with each other's faces. They have talked everything they knew
about. Everything is finished, all communication is dropped. They are in
a state of getting mad.</p><p>And that is the situation of the wealthy man in the West. What I have
said is absolutely true. This is the moment, if the man has courage
enough to move out of the mob mind and takes the responsibility of
freedom and searches for truth, searches for masters who can help
personally and intimately -- he will become a new man, rather than
becoming a madman.</p><p>Q: BHAGWAN, FOR YEARS, THERE HAVE BEEN GROWTH AND CONSCIOUSNESS
MOVEMENTS. WHAT IS GROWTH AND</p><p>CONSCIOUSNESS REALLY ABOUT? IS CONSCIOUSNESS SOMETHING EVERYONE HAS
AND CAN DEVELOP -- OR DO SOME HAVE IT, AND SOME DON'T?</p><p>A: First: it was George Gurdjieff who for the first time in the whole
history of man stated that everybody does not have the consciousness.
Few have. The majority is without consciousness.</p><p>It was simply a device. It is not a statement of truth. Because all
ancient mystics have been saying, that everybody has consciousness. All
that is to be done is to discover it, to become aware of it. They were
stating the truth. But people are in such an unconscious state that they
will misuse even a statement which contains truth -- and they have
misused.</p><p>Because two possibilities are there: if everybody has consciousness,
and the only difference is that few people become aware of it, and that
is what growth means. That is what consciousness is all about: becoming
conscious of your consciousness. And then you start growing in a new
dimension, which has never been available to you.</p><p>Ordinarily you grow only mentally, physically. The body gets old. The
mind gets more and more knowledgeable. And these two are available to
everybody. But the real growth begins when you start becoming aware of
your potential of consciousness. Then you are moving from the individual
to the universal, from the mortal to the immortal, from death to eternal
life.</p><p>Because all the mystics have said it, people became very satisfied
with the statement, that "The only difference is that we are not aware.
A Gautam Buddha is aware. So we can become aware any moment. There is no
hurry about it. There are much more important things that you have to do
first. This can be done any time. There are things which you can do only
today, but this is something that you can do tomorrow,
day-after-tomorrow; in this life, in another life. There are thousands
of lives available, so you can do it anytime."</p><p>That gave them a dangerous safety. Gurdjieff has to hit hard, to make
people aware, that "Forget all that nonsense. Only very few people have
consciousness. And unless you strive for it, you can't have it. So it is
not to be postponed. Each moment is valuable, and it is the most
important thing in life. There is nothing for which you can postpone
it." In fact he wanted to create an urgency about it, and he had to lie.
But his lie is out of compassion, seeing that people have made the truth
a dangerous buffer. It protects them from growing spiritually, because
they can always say, "There is not much problem. Consciousness I have
got. Just I have to be conscious about it, so any day I can do it. And
eternity is available." Gurdjieff was very perceptive, that whatever the
mystics have been saying, was true but they have never looked what was
the result. They wanted everybody to know, that "You have consciousness.
There is no need to be worried about it, you can grow it." They were
simply stating a fact, without seeing what is going to be the effect on
the sleepy people. In their sleep they will think, "There is no
hurry,</p><p>we can sleep a little more. It does not make much difference whether
you wake up today or tomorrow. Right now sleep seem so beautiful, so why
disturb it?" Gurdjieff was the first man to become aware that to tell
the truth to the sleepy people is a dangerous thing. They need to be
shaken, shocked -- and this is one of the greatest shocks, even to hear
it: that you may not have any consciousness at all, that this death will
be simply death, nothing will be remaining out of it. You will be simply
dying totally. You are nothing but body and mind. You don't have any
eternal element in you. Because you have not produced it. It is not
given by birth, that is Gurdjieff's point. To insist, that "You are not
given from the birth. You have to work for it and work hard, and you
have to attain it before death. Otherwise your death will be complete
death. So don't wait for another life!"</p><p>And he really created panic in many intelligent people, because the
man was of great power, of tremendous understanding. He knew what has to
be done with a sleepy man better than anybody else. All these mystics
were nice guys. He was not. They were simply saying what was true. It is
not enough to say the truth.</p><p>Unless you bring people to the truth, your statements have no truth.
If they prevent people from coming to truth, then you may be thinking
you are saying the truth, but you are preventing millions of people from
attaining it. Who is responsible for it? So Gurdjieff gave a totally new
turn. People were shocked, because they have never heard, that "You
don't have any souls. All people don't have. You have to create it. Then
you can have it. It is your greatest creativity, greatest effort. So
only very few people out of millions will be surviving death. Others
will be dying like dogs, nothing will be surviving."</p><p>He was emphatically trying to wake you up, that "Stop postponing. You
don't have it. And postponement is dangerous. Tomorrow you may not be
here, so today is all that you have got. Create it -- before death
knocks on your doors. Do everything to create it."</p><p>So I support him perfectly -- knowing that he is lying. But his lying
is far more compassionate, more understanding of man, than all the
mystics of the past who have been telling the truth. But they were just
nice people, good people, who never lie, but without taking in
consideration what their statements are going to do to people. Gurdjieff
was very much concerned, not much concerned what he says, much concerned
what effect it creates in you. If that effect brings you closer to
truth, then he was ready to say anything.</p><p>Very few people have understood Gurdjieff. The followers think he is
telling the truth. The people who are against him see that he is telling
certainly a lie because all the mystics cannot be wrong, and he is the
only man who is saying such a thing. A single man against the whole
history of mystics, of different races, different countries -- who have
all emphasized, that "You are born as consciousness." -- and he is
simply denying them all.</p><p>But both have misunderstood him. Neither the critics can see his
compassion, nor the followers can see that he is lying, but his lie is
to produce a certain effect. He was a very scientific man.</p><p>So I agree with him and I disagree with him. I know everybody has the
soul. It has not to be created, and there is no way to create it. If you
don't have it, you don't have it.</p><p>You can discover it only, you cannot create it. And that discovery
can be helped by Gurdjieff's statement. If you are shaken, and you
cannot sleep anymore, knowing that you may not have the soul at all --
because you have not encountered. One thing is certain. You are not
aware, so you cannot deny him. You know your mind. You know your body,
but you don't know the knower, who knows the mind, who knows the body --
but he is there. Knowing the mind, knowing the body is enough proof that
there is a third entity in you, which knows these both. And it is from
the very birth. In fact, if you listen to children, in the beginning all
the children of all the races use third person for themselves. They
don't say, "I am thirsty." They say, "The baby is thirsty." Or whatever
is their name, that "Pinky is thirsty." They use the third person. It is
strange. It is universal. Not a single baby starts by using, that "I am
thirsty."</p><p>What will be the reason of it? The reason is that the innocent child
is yet not programmed. He knows it perfectly well, that he is not
thirsty, because he is aware in a certain way of his consciousness, and
he is identified with his consciousness. The ego has not been created
yet. And he knows, that "I'm not thirsty." Because when he thinks of
thirst, he thinks, "The body is thirsty. The mind is feeling the
thirst." Not so analytically, so logically, but in some innocent way
every baby is aware, that there is something within him: his reality --
which is never thirsty, never hungry. It is always the body, which he
calls the baby, or whatever name the people have given to him. He also
uses the name as if he is outside that personality.</p><p>Soon he will be losing that innocence. We won't allow him to remain
that innocent. We will, by the time he is three of four years old, force
him to say, that "I am thirsty."</p><p>And the day he starts saying, "I am thirsty," he is getting into a
tremendously long journey of falsehoods. Soon he will get identified
with the body and the mind, and will forget his real identity.</p><p>So when Gurdjieff said to people, that "You don't have any soul",
nobody stood up to say to him, that "What are you talking about?" Nobody
was capable. They have heard only that everybody has a soul. But what to
do with Gurdjieff? He is challenging, that "You don't have a soul.
Unless you create, you can't have it. You have deserve it, why you
should have it by the birth? What you have done to get it?"</p><p>So I agree with him as a device, but I disagree with him because that
is not a statement of truth.</p><p>And you are asking, "What is growth and what is consciousness
movement?" It is basically to understand that within you there is a line
running into eternity. If you get disidentified with the mind and the
body, you will suddenly become</p><p>aware of a luminous eternity. That is the discovery of consciousness.
And then growth happens.</p><p>Then you don't simply grow old. You grow up. You mature. Then you
don't go on collecting thoughts, and thinking that you are becoming a
great intellectual. No, then you grow in intelligence, not in
intellectuality. You become more perceptive, more alert, more aware. You
start seeing things which you have never seen before, within yourself
and without you too.</p><p>There is a radical transformation of your whole personality. The
personality disappears and individuality appears. All that is false in
you goes on dropping, like dry leaves, dead leaves falling from the
trees.</p><p>And fresh, young, new leaves start coming out of the tree.</p><p>You are always young, once you have discovered your consciousness.
You are always fresh. You are always joyful. You have become part of the
eternal dance of existence.</p><p>I call it growth.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BHAGWAN, WHAT IS SPIRITUALITY?</p><p>A: The old concept has been, that spirituality is something against
materialism. To renounce the pleasures of matter, of body, of mind has
been defined as spirituality. To me it is nonsense.</p><p>Spirituality is to be disidentified with everything that you can see,
that can be an object to you -- so that finally you remain only the
subject. Pure subjectivity is spirituality. It has nothing to do with
renouncing anything. In fact, the spiritual being will be able to enjoy
everything more intensely, more totally than the materialist. The
materialist is very poor. All the religions have condemned the poor
materialist. He has nothing worth condemning. His life is
superficial.</p><p>Spirituality is life in depth, in ultimate depth. You are centered at
your very being. But you can go on living on the circumference, moving
freely anywhere -- still remaining at the center. Your identity is at
the center. You know who you are. Then there is no problem, if you enjoy
food, if you enjoy clothes, if you enjoy a beautiful house, if you enjoy
music, painting. There is no problem. There is no need to renounce
it.</p><p>Old spirituality has killed so much of creativity in man, that some
day if man becomes aware of what the old spirituality has done, all your
saints will be condemned as the greatest criminals -- for the simple
reason because they have prevented all creativity. Condemned it as
materialism.</p><p>They tried to live a juiceless life, and they enforced on other
people also to live in the same way. Spirituality was something like
living in a corpse.</p><p>To me spirituality is living totally, intensely, burning your torch
on both the ends. Still remaining aware of your center, never losing for
a single moment the awareness of who you are. Then it doesn't matter
where you are.</p><p>If you remember who you are, it does not matter where you are. You
will be in absolute bliss.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BHAGWAN, WHY ARE PEOPLE SPACING OUT INSTEAD OF IN?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Because spacing out is simple. It can be done through chemical
means, through drugs, through alcohol, through LSD, through marijuana,
through hashish. It is simple, because the question is just eating
something or smoking something, and you space out. But no drug can take
you in. They are from the outside, they can take you outside. They can
create a very beautiful hallucination. And once you have tasted that
beautiful hallucination, then you want it more and more -- because the
reality is so mundane.</p><p>Your forefathers, your past, has destroyed all beauty, all joy in the
ordinary world. They have not enhanced it. So when you go on a drug
trip, you create an individual dreamworld which is beautiful. And to
come back from it, this world seems even more dull and dead than before.
Now you have a comparison.</p><p>Going in needs effort. No chemicals can help. Going in means you have
to become meditative. You have to make tremendous effort to become
aware. Certainly once you get in, you will be surprised, that whatever
you were getting by spacing out was just hallucination. You were wasting
your time. Spacing out was hallucination and the world outside was dull,
but when you get in through meditation, -- that is the only way that
leads inwards -- it transforms your whole vision. The ordinary, mundane
reality becomes so beautiful. You don't need to go to any paradise. The
very motivation for paradise disappears. This very moment it is
here.</p><p>The ordinary flowers and the ordinary birds singing in the morning,
it is so celestial, so sacred. Looked from your innermost core, this
world becomes so magnificent, so marvellous, that you cannot conceive
anything can be better than this. And once you are in, all those drugs
look stupid, because you were just dreaming and deceiving yourself. But
they are simple and cheap.</p><p>Spacing in is costly. You have to pay for it, by your effort, by your
constant effort in spite of many failures. It is a real growth. It takes
time. But it is worth, millions times more worth than the whole world --
because it will give you a new vision, which transforms this ordinary
world into an extraordinary ecstasy.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BHAGWAN, WHAT CAN A LIVING BUDDHA OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY GIVE TO
PEOPLE?</p><p>A: The buddha can always give the same thing. Centuries don't matter.
He can teach you how to space in.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BHAGWAN, YOU ARE GOING ON A WORLD TOUR. WHAT WILL YOUR MESSAGE
BE?</p><p>A: My message is, that we have to create a world without the boundary
of nations, without the boundary of religions -- only then we will be
for the first time civilized. Otherwise we are carrying barbarious past
in beautiful garbs.</p><p>My effort will be to expose our barbariousness, in nationalism, in
different groups, calling them religions; in different political
ideologies, creating hopes for man for an utopia.</p><p>And these things they have been doing for thousands of years, and
nothing materializes. It is time that we drop all the boundaries, all
the distinctions of color and race, and bring the whole humanity as one,
undivided whole. That will be the beginning of civilization.</p><p>So my whole effort is to expose all hypocrisy, and to bring to
people's mind, that how we have been deceived and how we are deceiving
ourselves.</p><p>If it can be explained to people directly, I trust immensely in the
hidden intelligence of humanity. They will drop all this, because if
they can be shown the relationship between the national boundaries,
religious boundaries -- that they have been nothing but destructive,
murderous, creating more and more wars. They are still doing the same,
and perhaps this time they may destroy the whole life on the earth.</p><p>And it has taken millions of years, from the time life existed only
in the ocean as fish, millions of years have taken nature to bring
evolution to man. Of course nature cannot go beyond that. But few people
have tried and have transcended nature too, and these are the people I
call the awakened ones, the enlightened ones. Perhaps it is only the
planet in the whole universe, where a man like Gautam Buddha has
existed. To destroy life is not just destroying life on this planet. It
is destroying a tremendously great adventure of existence, because all
these stars, millions of stars, have millions of planets like earth.</p><p>It is suspected that at least on fifty thousand planets, there may be
some kind of life. But no scientist is capable to say certainly that on
any planet, life has reached higher than on this planet. This small
earth is the most precious planet in the immense universe, and it cannot
be destroyed by a few idiots -- they may be religious, they may be
political.</p><p>And the question is to create a public opinion against any kind of
war, but wars can be basically stopped only if we drop all the limits.
Otherwise such insane things go on happening.</p><p>Just the other day I was seeing a report, that in European Common
Market they have accumulated so much surplus food, that just to destroy
it, it will take three to four billion dollars, to destroy it! It is not
the cost of the food. To drown it in the ocean will take three to four
billion dollars.</p><p>And they are going to do it. They will not give it to Ethiopia, where
thousands of people continue to die every day. They will not give it to
Nepal. They will not give it to India, where millions of people are
waiting at any moment to starve and die. Why they will not give it to
anyone? They don't feel any responsibility.</p><p>Their whole problem is economic, not human. They don't want to lower
the price of their goods. Otherwise their markets will collapse, and
they cannot give those things free. And why they should give? This is
the problem basically deep down, because giving it to Ethiopia is not in
a state to purchase.</p><p>If they give to some other country which is purchasing goods from
them, then certainly their prices will come down and their whole
economic structure will fall. But giving to Ethiopia will not affect.
Giving to Nepal will not affect, because these poor people are not
purchasing anyway. They don't have any purchasing power.</p><p>But nobody feels. Ethiopia is Mohammedan. Why Christians should
bother about it? Let them die. That makes the population of Christianity
bigger than the Mohammedan. If Hindus start dying in India, why the
Christians should give their food to them -- although it is surplus and
they are going to throw it in the ocean. If the Hindus die in India,
there is a possibility that the Christians in India will become the
rulers.</p><p>Now Christianity is the third greatest religion in India. But they
will not be the people to die in starvation, because they are
well-supported by the Western Christian countries. The people who will
be dying will be the Mohammedans and Hindus.</p><p>There is a possibility that so many Hindus and Mohammedans will die
that Christianity will become the major religion in India. And let them
die, let them start to die, then it is easier to convert them. Just
giving them food is enough to convert them to Christianity.</p><p>And if they are adamant, then it is better to get rid of them.
Christianity becomes the major religion, India becomes a Christian
country. So again Christians are the rulers of the country.</p><p>Unless we stop all these limits, which make us human, behave with
other human beings in such an ugly way -- there is not much hope. The
only hope is that we can convince the new generation, to get out of the
prisons of nations, religions, political ideologies, and create one
world, one earth, one humanity.</p><h1 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:6pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=the-last-testament-vol-6-chapter-5>The Last Testament, Vol 6

which has not been published, as of August 1992.]</p><p>PRESS INTERVIEWS</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHAT DID YOU LEARN ON YOUR JUST COMPLETED WORLD TOUR?</p><p><br></p><p>A: With great pain in my heart I have to convey to you that man, as
he is today, is not worth fighting for.</p><p>I have come home with dreams broken, fictions destroyed, hopes
shattered. What I have seen is the reality, and what I had been thinking
all my life about man was only his mask.</p><p>I will give you a few examples because the whole world tour would
take almost a month to relate to you. So I will give only a few
significant points which can indicate... Before me, from the East,
Vivekananda, Ramateertha, Krishnamurti and hundreds of others have gone
around the world, but no one was once condemned by the whole world the
way I have been condemned -- because they all behaved politically.</p><p>In a Christian country they would praise Christianity, in a
Mohammedan country they would praise Mohammedanism. Naturally, in a
Christian country if a man from the East, who is not Christian, praises
Jesus Christ as highly as he praises Gautam Buddha, naturally Christians
are happy, immensely happy. And none of these people have converted any
Christians from the West to the Eastern vision of things, the Eastern
way of life.</p><p>Meanwhile, the West has been sending its missionaries and converting
millions of Eastern people to Christianity. Perhaps I was the first
person who has converted thousands of young, educated, intelligent
people into the Eastern way of thinking and living. And that shocked the
religious vested interests in the West, the political vested interests
in the West to such an extent that it was unbelievable. I would not have
believed it myself if I had not gone on the world tour.</p><p>The whole of Europe has a parliament and that parliament has decided
that my plane cannot land on any airport in Europe. The question of my
entering their country does not arise -- I cannot even land my plane for
refueling on their airport. And the reason has been given that I am a
dangerous man. I cannot see the logic -- refueling my airplane, what
danger can I do to a country in fifteen minutes?</p><p>In England, I arrived at eleven in the night. The pilot's flying time
was finished and he had to rest for twelve hours, and they wouldn't
allow me to rest in the airport. I told them, "In the airport, special
facilities are made for transit passengers who will be staying for a few
hours and will leave. I am not entering England."</p><p>But they said, "We are sorry. Orders from above are that "this man is
dangerous, he can destroy your religion, he can destroy your morality,
he should not be allowed in the country."</p><p>I said, "I am not entering the country. The airport is not the
country. And in taking five, six hours of sleep at the airport I cannot
conceive how I can destroy your morality and your religion and your
tradition. And if it is possible that a man, just by sleeping in the
first class lounge at the airport for six hours, can destroy a religion
and morality which has been preached for two thousand years, then it is
worth destroying."</p><p>On the second day, in the British parliament, the question was asked,
"Why was he prevented?"</p><p>And the same answer was given: that I am dangerous to morality, to
religion, to tradition. The strange thing is that in the whole
parliament not a single member asked, "What can a man do in the middle
of the night, tired, sleeping, and leaving again at six o'clock in the
morning? In what way can he destroy your Christianity which you have
been preaching -- conditioning each child from his very childhood -- for
two thousand years? If your two thousand years of teaching can be
destroyed in six hours, then there must be something wrong with your
teaching."</p><p>Even countries where I was not going, their parliaments decided that
I should not be allowed into the country.</p><p>One small country, Uruguay, allowed me to enter because the president
had been reading my writings, listening to my tapes -- a young man,
intelligent. He gave me a six months' visa to stay, he wanted to see me.
But the moment I entered Uruguay, American pressure became tremendously
hot and the American president told the Uruguayan president that if I
was not thrown out of Uruguay within thirty-six hours then all the loans
that had been given to Uruguay in the past, billions of dollars, would
have to be paid back immediately. If they could not be paid, then the
rate of interest would be doubled from tomorrow.</p><p>Secondly, America said,"All the agreements that are being made for
the coming five years" -- which again amounted to billions of dollars of
loans to Uruguay -- "are cancelled. You can choose, you are free. You
can have this man or you can have our support."</p><p>You will be surprised, it was reported that the president, with tears
in his eyes, said, "Rajneesh's coming to Uruguay has at least given me
one insight: that we are not independent."</p><p>I had to leave within thirty-six hours, because a poor country like
Uruguay cannot manage to pay the billions of dollars they owe from the
past, nor to be cut off from future loans. I told the president of
Uruguay, "You need not be worried, I can understand the condition. You
will feel bad if you deport me. I am leaving on my own so you will not
feel bad." And as I left, the president of Uruguay received an
invitation from Washington to meet President Ronald Reagan. He was given
a great welcome and a three hundred and sixty million dollar immediate
loan, for which there was no agreement made before -- a reward.</p><p>The old slavery has disappeared it seems; politically, humanity seems
to be no longer a slave. But a far deeper slavery, economic slavery, has
entered in.</p><p>I moved around almost the whole world and in every country the same
situation was repeated, again and again. I would reach the country, and
before me, an American plane would arrive to contact the president or
the prime minister and inform him of the danger.</p><p>The president of Uruguay told me that it would be better for me to
stop my world tour, because he was concerned about my life. What he had
heard in the White House is that they have a contract with a
professional assassinator for half a million dollars, if he can kill me.
A single man without any arms, and the biggest, most powerful country in
the world is so afraid?</p><p>The attorney general of America told the press that he does not want
to hear my name, does not want to see my face in any newspaper, in any
news magazine; he does not want to know whether I am still alive or
dead. I should be completely erased. And what crime have I committed?
Just to think is the greatest crime; and to show people that they are
wrong is the greatest crime.</p><p>I was in Greece at the invitation of the president of Greece. I
accepted the invitation because I wanted to see who the people are who
killed a man like Socrates.</p><p>In the East we have worshipped Gautam Buddha -- they were
contemporaries. Both Budddha and Socrates have the same qualities of
tremendous intelligence, both have the consciousness to raise man to
higher planes of being. We worshipped Gautam Buddha and Greece poisoned
Socrates. I wanted to see what kind of people these are.</p><p>A one month visa was given to me, and within fifteen days the
archbishop of Greece declared that if I was not turned out of Greece
that very moment, then he was going to burn me alive with all my friends
in the house where I was a guest. I was asleep at the time when the
police arrived. Just two weeks -- only two more weeks I was going to be
there. My secretary in Greece told the police, "You sit in the waiting
room and I will wake him up, let him wash his face and change his
clothes."</p><p>They would not wait for five minutes. They said, "We will burn the
house. We have brought dynamite," and they showed dynamite.</p><p>And they threw the girl who was my secretary from a high platform to
the gravel road, dragged her to the police car without any arrest
warrant, without any</p><p>reason. Her only fault was that she had said to the police, "Please
wait five minutes so I can wake him up."</p><p>I woke suddenly, I could not believe what was happening -- because I
don't have nightmares. It seemed as if bombs were exploding, because the
police had started throwing stones at doors, at windows; they threw
rocks in to the house. I rushed down, I inquired, "What is the
matter?"</p><p>And they said, "You have to leave this very moment because the
archbishop of the Orthodox Christian church does not want you to be
here."</p><p>I said, "There is no problem. I did not come on my own, I have been
invited. This is an insult to the president of Greece, and to me it is a
confirmation that you are the people who must have killed Socrates.
Because I have been here only two weeks and have never left my house.
Socrates had been here his whole life. In twenty-five centuries you have
not changed, you are still brutes."</p><p>I went around the world, there was experience after experience of the
same kind. All democracy is fake, all ideology about freedom, freedom of
speech, is fake; All hope that someday man will become human seems to be
a far away utopia.</p><p>I have always believed in non-violence, believed in peace, but after
this world tour I have to confess to you that I cannot believe in peace
and non-violence any more. I have been against the third world war, but
with great pain I have to tell you that perhaps the third world war is
needed. This humanity is so rotten that it should be destroyed, at least
the world should be cleaned of ugly human beings. Existence must find
some other way to evolve human consciousness.</p><p>Scientists say that there are fifty thousand planets in the universe
where life exists. So if on this tiny earth life disappears, there is no
harm. This kind of life is not the life of man. Darwin was absolutely
wrong that man has evolved out of monkeys -- man is still a monkey.
Perhaps he has fallen from the trees, that's all. Not evolved, but
fallen.</p><p>My effort from today will be just to work for those few individuals
who want to grow into meditation, into peace, into silence; and I drop
all hope for humanity and all hope for this planet. It is in ugly hands
and it is impossible to change those people because they have all the
power.</p><p>Even in my own country... just yesterday as I entered I saw, written
at the airport, "Welcome to India." I had no luggage, I had nothing to
declare except myself, and still I had to wait for three hours. And I
asked again and again, "What kind of welcome are you giving to an
Indian? I am not a tourist."</p><p>This ugly bureaucracy, these ugly governments, these ugly religions,
have spoiled a beautiful planet. I have called you simply to say that I
am utterly disappointed, disillusioned. I will live only for those
people who are individually interested to evolve.</p><p>As a humanity, there is no hope. Only one thing I can hope -- the
sooner the third world war happens the better. Let us be finished with
all this garbage.</p><p>Q: DO YOU PLAN TO SETTLE IN INDIA?</p><p>A: Yes.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHY DID YOU LEAVE IN THE FIRST PLACE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Because of you.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: CAN YOU CLARIFY THAT, PLEASE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I had been working in India for thirty years, and thousands of
Westerners started coming to India to listen to me; they invited me to
their countries. I thought this was a good opportunity for the East,
because the West has always dominated the East; it has made it a slave
materialistically, politically, for hundreds of years. The only answer
from the East can be a spiritual conquest of the West -- that's why I
went there.</p><p>They can give us bread, we can give them soul. They can give us
shelters, we can give them life.</p><p>They are hollow, there is nothing inside them. We may be poor but
spiritually we are rich. Their effort is to make us more and more poor
because only poor people can be converted to Christianity. And they
became my enemies, as a whole, because I was appealing not to the poor,
not to the orphans, not to the beggars; but to the professors, the
surgeons, the scientists, the painters, the musicians -- to their
genius, their very cream.</p><p>It is a deep humiliation to them. Otherwise it has never happened in
history that the whole world should be against a single man. I am
fortunate in that way.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THE HARE KRISHNA MOVEMENT HAS NOT BEEN EXPELLED FROM THE WEST.
OTHER INDIAN SPIRITUAL LEADERS HAVE NOT BEEN DENOUNCED IN THE WEST. WHY
ARE YOU THE ONLY ONE TO SUFFER THIS PERSECUTION?</p><p><br></p><p>A: For the simple reason that the Hare Krishna movement has never
said a single word against Christ.</p><p>On the contrary, the Hare Krishna movement has been telling the West
that Christ is only another name of Krishna. Naturally, people are
happy, there is no problem. Krishnamurti never condemned, never
criticized, any religion by name. This was pure politics.</p><p>Vivekananda praised Christianity as much as he praised anything else,
so why should they be against him?. But I simply say the truth, I am not
saying what you want to hear. I am saying what is the reality. I cannot
say that Jesus Christ walked on water -- that is nonsense. If it is
true, then the pope should at least walk on a swimming pool -- being the
representative of Jesus Christ.</p><p>They say Jesus Christ is born out of a virgin girl. This they call
morality. Just the other day I was reading a joke: A young girl,
seventeen years old, became pregnant. The mother was shocked. She took
her to the doctor, the doctor examined the girl. The girl asked the
doctor, "I have never met any man. No man has ever touched me, never
kissed me -- how can I be pregnant?"</p><p>The doctor went to the window, opened the window, and looked at the
stars; a few minutes passed. The mother said, "What is the matter? What
are you doing there?"</p><p>He said, "This has happened only once, when Jesus Christ was born,
but then a star appeared. I am looking for the star again. Without a
man, how can this girl become pregnant? And I don't see any star, I
don't see any three wise men from the East coming to worship."</p><p>Scientifically, it is so absurd. I have even challenged the pope that
I am ready to argue with him in the Vatican amongst his people. He
cannot prove a single thing about Christ. His whole religion stands on
superstition: Jesus touches people and they are healed, he makes dead
people come alive. Just think of a person today who makes dead people
alive, touches people and they are healed, walks on water... will he not
be the topmost news? But in the contemporary literature of that time
Jesus' name is not even mentioned -- except in the Christian BIBLE. No
other writing even mentions his name, such a man who turns water into
wine; although that is not a miracle, it is a crime.</p><p>Krishnamurti or Maharishi Mahesh Yogi or Yogananda or Vivekananda...
none of them touched these sore spots, that's why they have not been
condemned.</p><p>And this is the whole of Christianity. We have known higher
religions, we don't depend on Jesus walking on water to be religious.
Otherwise, what would have happened to Gautam Buddha? He never walked on
water. -- What would have happened to Krishna? He never walked on water.
These people never raised dead people back to life. If Jesus is the
criterion of religion then all religions are meaningless. But Jesus is
not the criterion.</p><p>He is claiming that he is the only begotten son of God. As far as I
am concerned, I have been telling the West that Jesus is a crackpot.
Naturally they are offended. Why should God create only one son? Since
eternity he has been trying and he has been able to create only one son?
and here even Indian beggars go on creating sons every year. And the way
he creates his son is not moral, it is absolutely immoral. Somebody
else's wife... you just try to make her pregnant and you will know
whether it is morality or it is immorality.</p><p>In the Christian trinity there is no space for a woman. There is God
the father, God the son, and the Holy Ghost. Who is this Holy Ghost guy,
man or woman? It seems he functions both ways -- perhaps he is a
bisexual.</p><p>To see things as they are is one thing. I am not interested in
convincing anybody, I am simply interested in bringing the truth to
people, and truth hurts. Lies are very sweet. They can be made sweeter,
because you create them.</p><p>Who are the three wise men who came to Jerusalem from the East to
celebrate Jesus? Their names are not mentioned, because even today no
truly wise man will accept Christianity as a religion.</p><p>I have heard about one famous Japanese sage, Rinzai. A high Christian
priest went to Rinzai with the BIBLE to convert him. He opened it to the
Sermon on the Mount, which is the only beautiful chapter in the BIBLE,
otherwise the BIBLE is one of the most pornographic books in the whole
word. Five hundred solid pages of pornography. If it is called the HOLY
BIBLE, then what is unholy?</p><p>He opened it to the Sermon on the Mount, he read two lines; Rinzai
said, "Stop. Sometime in the future this man will become a buddha, but
not now."</p><p>The first two lines were, "Blessed are the poor because they shall
inherit the kingdom of God," and "A camel can pass through the eye of a
needle, but a rich man cannot pass through the gates of heaven."</p><p>At this point Rinzai said, "Stop."</p><p>If poverty is a blessing then we should spread poverty. Then the more
poor the world is, the more blessed. Then more people will be in heaven.
If richness is such a sin that, `the camel can pass through the eye of a
needle but a rich man cannot pass through the gates of heaven', then all
rich people should distribute their riches and become poor beggars.</p><p>This is not religion, this is sheer politics -- a consolation for the
poor, "Don't be worried, it is only a question of a few years and you
will be in the presence of God." And an effort to prevent revolution --
"Don't be angry about the rich men. They are going to suffer in eternal
hell."</p><p>Remember the phrase `eternal hell'. No other religion of the world
believes in eternal hell. How many sins can you commit in one life?
Christianity believes in only one life. How many sins can you commit?
Even if you start committing from the very first day you are born, and
until the last breath you go on committing sins: don't eat, don't sleep,
don't do anything, only commit sin. Even then eternal punishment will
not be the right judgment.</p><p>One of the most important philosophers of this age, Bertrand Russell,
born a Christian, wrote a book called, WHY I AM NOT A CHRISTIAN. One of
his reasons was, "I have committed sins and I have dreamt of committing
sins. If they both are joined together, the hardest judge cannot
sentence me to more than four and a half years of jail. But eternal
hell? no exit? Once you go into hell you will remain there forever?"
These are stupid things with no logic behind them.</p><p>I have been condemned because I believe there are two types of people
in the world; one which wants that the truth should always be behind
him, and the other which wants that he should always be behind the
truth. I belong to the second category. The names that you have
mentioned belong to the first category. And that is the difference
between a mystic and a politician.</p><p>It hurts, because from the very childhood you have been brought up
with a certain way of thinking. Jesus is crucified -- just think -- a
man who brings people alive after four days of death! And killed by his
own people... because he was a</p><p>Jew, remember, he never was a Christian, he never heard the word
'Christian'. He was never known as Christ in his own times because the
word 'Christ' is a Greek word. Hebrew has no word like 'Christ' or
'Christian'. And Jesus was absolutely uneducated, he had no knowledge
even of Hebrew. He spoke a small local dialect -- Aramaic. He was born a
Jew, he lived as a Jew, he died as a Jew.</p><p>The boy was doing great because he died when he was only
thirty-three. Jews would have hailed him as God. If you can hail a Satya
Sai Baba just because he can produce stupid things, Swiss watches or a
holy ass, and you can worship him as God... then Jesus has really done
miracles -- if he actually did them.</p><p>Jews would have respected him forever. But they crucified him. Not
only did they crucify him, but on that day, three persons were condemned
to be crucified. And it was the convention that every year, before the
Jewish holidays began, the crucifixion would happen and the Jews were
then given a chance to pardon one of these three condemmed persons.</p><p>Judea was under the rule of Rome. The viceroy of Judea was a Roman,
Pontius Pilate. He hoped that they would ask to pardon Jesus because he
was innocent, he had never done any harm to anybody. He talks nonsense,
he looks like a clown, he talks like a madman saying that he is the only
begotten son of God, but this is not harmful and these are not crimes.
At the most, he needs some psychiatric treatment, but not crucifixion.
Pontius was thinking that the Jews would ask for Jesus because the other
two persons were confirmed criminals; but the Jews said that Barabbas
should be released. Barabbas had murdered seven people and had committed
every crime that is possible to man.</p><p>Pontius Pilate could not believe that they were asking for Barabbas,
and not for Jesus. Can you believe? A man who has done only good, healed
people, raised the dead, had never even been charged for speeding
because he was only riding on a donkey his whole life!.</p><p>I cannot conceive that the miracles claimed about Jesus are true;
they are all false and fictitious and created. And now, even
Christianity and the great Christian theologians are having conferences
all over the world that, "If we can get rid of these miracles it will be
good, because for the future intelligent people these miracles will be
barriers. In the past they proved him to be a god, but in the future
they will prove him to be, at most, a magician." But if you take away
all the miracles of Jesus then nothing is left.</p><p>In the East we have known Gautam Buddha, we have known Mahavira, we
have known the seers of the UPANISHADS who have taken flights --
ultimate flights, into human consciousness. But the names you are
talking about have been trying to put Upanishadic seers, Gautam Buddha,
Mahavira, in the same category as Jesus. Jesus belongs to the category
of Satya Sai Baba -- not more than that; both are fake.</p><p>And there has never been any resurrection. I have seen the grave of
Jesus in Kashmir. He never died on the cross, it was a conspiracy.</p><p>The Crucifixion was on a Friday; starting on Saturday for three days
Jews would stop all work for Passover. So Friday was chosen by Pontius
Pilate, and he delayed the crucifixion as long as he possibly could. And
you should remember a scientific fact: that the Jewish crucifixion takes
at least forty-eight hours for a person to die because he is not hung by
the neck, he is nailed to the cross by the hands and the feet, so drop
by drop the blood goes out. It takes a healthy man forty-eight hours to
die, and Jesus was only thirty-three -- perfectly healthy. He could not
have died in six hours, nobody has ever died that way in six hours. But
because Friday's sun was setting, he had to be brought down and for
three days all work had to stop. This was the conspiracy.</p><p>He was taken from the cave, he escaped, and he lived in India in
Kashmir. What you see in Pundit Jawaharlal Nehru's nose, Indhira
Gandhi's nose is not very strange -- they are Jewish. Moses died in
Kashmir, Jesus also died in Kashmir after living a long life of one
hundred and twelve years. I have been to his grave and it is still being
taken care of by a Jewish family. That is the only grave in Kashmir
which does not face towards Mecca; all the other graves are Mohammedan.
Mohammedan graves are made so that the head is directed towards
Mecca.</p><p>And the inscription on the grave, in Hebrew, is clear. The name you
have been accustomed to, Jesus, was not his name; that is his name in
Greek. His name was Joshua and it is written still on the grave that
"Joshua, a great teacher of religion, travelled from Judea, lived here,
died at the age of one hundred and twelve years, and lies here".</p><p>But it is strange, I have talked all over the West, but not a single
Western Christian is ready to come to see the grave, because that will
spoil their whole theory of resurrection. I have asked them, "If he was
resurrected, then when did he die? You have to prove that." If after the
crucifixion he was resurrected, then he must either have died or he must
still be around. -- They don't have any description of his death.</p><p>I was condemned because I was simply saying what is absolutely
logical, scientific, rational. The people you are talking about were not
interested in truth, they were interested in saying things to please
others. To me that is how the politician's mind is.</p><p>From the very beginning, as soon as the child is born, he becomes a
politician. He does not want to smile at his mother but he smiles. There
is no smile in his heart but he knows that a smile pays. He smiles at
the father, although he has no proof that he is his father. From that
moment a man starts learning politics -- do what people like. It is a
very strange world... here leaders are followers of their own
followers.</p><p>I am not a leader, I am simply a thinker. And I will live as a
thinker to the very last moment of my life.</p><p>I have informed Ronald Reagan not to waste half a million dollars on
killing me -</p><p>- just give half a million dollars to my work and I will leave my
body myself. I</p><p>have not paid a single rupee for my body and one day I will die and
nobody will pay a single rupee for it. Half a million dollars is a
perfectly good price. But why give it to somebody else and put him into
trouble? I am ready to die, just give half a million dollars to my work;
and it is negotiable!.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHEN YOU WERE IN DELHI AND KULU LAST TIME THERE WERE REPORTS THAT
THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT DOES NOT WANT YOU TO SET UP AN ASHRAM IN INDIA.
WAS THERE ANY TRUTH IN THOSE REPORTS? DO YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEMS WITH THE
GOVERNMENT?</p><p>A: I don't have problems with anybody but everybody has problems with
me. The American government has been pressuring the Indian government
that I should be kept in India and I should not be allowed to go out of
India. Also no foreigners, particularly news media people, should be
allowed to reach me. Those were the two conditions.</p><p>I cannot accept it; I never accept any conditions. I am a free man
and I would like to die a free man. Even if it is by a bullet, it
doesn't matter. But I cannot become a slave of such conditions. What is
the point of living if I am living under such conditions that I should
remain in India and no foreign disciples should be allowed to reach me?
That is almost killing me; that will be a living death.</p><p>They were going to take my passport because I wanted to move around
all the Christian countries. That's why I left India before -- to make
them aware that they can kill me, but they cannot kill my spirit.</p><p>Now I am in India again and I will fight the Indian government if any
conditions are imposed on me. Foreign devotees will be coming to me and
I will be going out of India in spite of the Indian government. I have
made my own arrangements.</p><p>And do you think this bogus Indian government can prevent me? They
should count their days -- just the next election and they will be
gone.</p><p>Politicians don't have long lives. And this politician who has
exploited his own mother's assassination will have to face reality in
the next election. He doesn't know anything; just because the mother was
assassinated, the son is made the prime minister of the country. Other
than that there is no quality, no integrity, no incentive -- that man is
no more than a pilot and should not try to be more. That is his training
and he should follow his own line and leave the country to people who
are wiser, who can change this country back to its golden age. What has
he done?</p><p>Just thirty years ago, when I started speaking Publicly, I spoke out
against the population growth. I was stoned, I was poisoned, a knife was
thrown, attempts on my life were made by people who thought that I was
trying to prevent the growth of Hinduism.</p><p>At that time the population of the country was four hundred million.
If they had listened to me we would have been one of the most
comfortable countries in the</p><p>world today, but now the population is nine hundred million. Just in
thirty years there has been an increase of five hundred million people;
and your politicians don't have the guts to say to the people, "Stop! No
more children."</p><p>Otherwise by the end of this century we will have passed beyond one
billion. For the first time in history we will be ahead of China; up to
now China has been ahead.</p><p>We will be the poorest country in the world. Fifty percent of the
population will be dying all around. Just think... if fifty percent of
the people are going to die around you. In this room... one hundred
people are present, if fifty people die... what about the fifty who will
be living with fifty ghosts?... their life will not be much of a
life.</p><p>You don't have a government, you don't have the politicians, you
don't have wise enough people who can change the fate of this country.
And this country is in immense need.</p><p>This country has the longest heritage in the world, and the greatest
heritage. We have something to give to the world, and they want to
prevent me from going out to it. Nobody can prevent me from going out,
and nobody can prevent people coming to me.</p><p>Q: DO YOU REALLY THINK THIS GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE CHANGED IN THE NEXT
ELECTION?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Certainly. It is a bogus government and it should be driven out.
Only immature people make up government. And just think, for forty years
even the mature politicians could not do anything and these are immature
people -- they cannot do anything but harm.</p><p>You have to start looking for people of merit. And there are people
of merit in the country. It is a big country but the problem is that the
man of merit, the man who is wise, the man who can help, will not beg
for votes. You will have to beg him, "Please help the country. Come
out."</p><p>These politicians are all beggars for votes. You are being dominated
by beggars and I am not in support of it.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY ABOUT MA SHEELA AND DEEKSHA?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No.Â Dead is dead, and finished is finished. I don't deal with
ghosts.</p><h1 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:6pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=the-last-testament-vol-6-chapter-6>The Last Testament, Vol 6

India</h1><p><br></p><p>[NOTE: This discourse will be in the book "India Coming Back Home",
which has not been published, as of August 1992.]</p><p>INTERVIEW BY AVIAN PATRIKA</p><p><br></p><p>I have seen the questions for today and they make me feel ashamed --
ashamed that Indian genius has fallen so low. It cannot even ask
significant questions; to find significant answers is absolutely
impossible. All the questions that have been shown to me are simply
rubbish: yellow journalism fulfilling the demands of the third class
humanity in which I am not interested.</p><p>This is a country of tremendous intelligence. This country reached to
the highest peak in the history of mankind, the Himalayan peaks of
consciousness. And now it seems we have fallen so low that unless a
question is concerned with something inhuman, ugly, nobody is interested
in the answer.</p><p>I am not a politician, so whoever dares to ask me a question should
remember that I am not here to console you or to give you answers which
you want. You may get hammered on the head. Because I don't have
anything to get from you in response.</p><p>My whole effort is to create a little flame of intelligence, a little
scent of humanness, so before you ask your questions, be aware! I am not
only answering your questions, I am answering the whole mind of a
certain continuity. This continuity is of Gautam Buddha, Kabir, Nanak --
and your questions belong to the gutter. You should ask these questions
to the politicians, don't waste my time.</p><p>This is just to indicate to you that if you don't want to be hammered
badly then be alert. The questioner in the introduction says that he is
my old lover; he has been writing against me for years. I can understand
-- old lovers are dangerous -- love can change into hate very easily.
And what kind of love did you have? You have not written a single word
for me, you have been exploiting me and my name, and in such ugly ways
that I feel it below myself even to answer you. So remember it, and ask
your questions.</p><p><br></p><p>MOST HUMBLY, MY FIRST QUESTION: WE WERE ALL EXCITED ABOUT YOUR
EXPERIMENT IN RAJNEESHPURAM. UNFORTUNATELY, THAT FAILED. KEEPING ASIDE
THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND CHRISTIAN BLACKMAIL WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS
FAILURE?</p><p>You, and your kind.</p><p>First, the experiment never failed. The experiment has been
absolutely successful. That was the problem, that it was successful.</p><p>Who cares about experiments which should have failed? Why should the
American government or Christianity or anybody be interested in an
experiment which has failed? It was absolutely successful, beyond their
comprehension. Its success was the problem, so please drop that word
`failure'; it does not exist in my vocabulary.</p><p>Whatever we wanted to do, we did it! A small commune of five thousand
people against the greatest world power in history survived for five
years and created the commune. And the commune was created in a desert
which had never been cultivated, had never seen flowers, had never seen
birds.</p><p>Within five years it became an oasis; we made houses for five
thousand people with every modern comfort. We made roads which are
better than any government's, America included.</p><p>The desert blossomed, it became green. We cultivated it, we made
dams, created lakes; thousands of birds started coming. It was a miracle
to see that thousands of deer from all over Oregon assembled in that
desert of one hundred and twenty-six square miles.</p><p>That said everything, because anywhere except Rajneeshpuram their
life was in danger, they were going to be hunted. In America, for ten
days each year, people are given total freedom to kill deer. In
Rajneeshpuram they were standing on the road; you could go on honking
your horn and they would not move. They knew you, that you were not
going to harm them; you would have to come down and push them to the
side.</p><p>Swans appeared, in a desert. There were three hundred peacocks from
all over America. It seems that birds and animals are more intelligent
than journalists. There was a tremendous harmony between the animals,
the birds, the trees, the flowers. We created an ecological system.</p><p>We were self-sufficient and we never begged a single dollar from
America. We never asked for any help from America.</p><p>You cannot live as a country without American help. You are a
failure, you are beggars. Your country was at one time a golden bird and
you have brought it to this condition.</p><p>American politicians were tremendously hurt that their help was not
needed, because that is their way to create slavery. Help is simply a
cover-up. If you take help in money you become enslaved, without
knowing. We never asked for anything.</p><p>This was hurting the American politicians -- the success. And each
year there was a world festival; twenty thousand sannyasins were coming
from all over the world. That time was a golden dream come true: twenty
thousand people meditating, singing, playing on their musical
instruments, dancing, rejoicing. Twenty thousand people had one kitchen!
Just conceive of twenty thousand</p><p>people eating together, while there was dancing, singing, rejoicing,
because that is my basic message: not renunciation, but rejoicing.</p><p>Sannyas became degraded because it became associated with
renunciation. It was not so in the beginning. In the days of Upanishad,
the days of Vedas, sannyas was not a renunciation. All your seers had
their communes in forests, rich communes. Poverty has never been praised
in the Vedas or in the Upanishads.</p><p>And renunciation is against God. The Sanskrit word for god is
`ishwar', and ishwar means richness, abundance.</p><p>Just look at Ram without Sita and you will see something is missing,
something tremendously important is missing. Perhaps the heart is
missing, only the dead corpse of Ram is there. Just think of Krishna
without those beautiful girls dancing around him. His flute will lose
its song.</p><p>I was trying, in the commune, to bring back the original sannyas. Not
of renouncing the world, but living the world as a gift of god; it is a
gift.</p><p>This became a problem because American spectators, American
television, American news media started coming every day -- planes
started coming to see the commune, to see what is happening. And the
whole of America was agog to see that these people have turned the
desert into a paradise.</p><p>We were not politicians. There was no political party, no political
ideology. We were neither communists nor capitalists, and yet we were
living the best life possible -- of love, of friendship.</p><p>We became a wound to the American politician. The only way was to
destroy the commune, so that the very question would be removed and
there would be no need to answer. The commune was destroyed by the
American government and fanatic Christians because it was the first time
that Christians had moved out of their fold without getting into another
fold.</p><p>A Hindu becomes a Christian: he leaves one prison and enters another.
A Christian becomes a Hindu: he leaves one bondage and accepts another.
For the first time they saw that you can leave the prison and there is
no need to enter another prison. You can be a free man.</p><p>A sannyasin is religious but has no religion. A sannyasin is a
spiritualist but he is not a Hindu, not a Mohammedan, not a Christian.
And by coincidence the American president, Ronald Reagan, is both a
third-rate politician and a fundamentalist Christian.</p><p>They tried every means to destroy us. Poor Sheela had nothing to do
with it. She certainly became a victim; I have all compassion for her.
It has to be understood how you can become entangled. All the telephones
from the commune were taped. I was in isolation and silence; Sheela was
my secretary and the president of the foundation. Seeing that all the
telephones were taped , she started taping the incoming calls to find
that the government, F.B.I., C.I.A.,and other</p><p>government agencies, had their agents in the commune hiding as
sannyasins, who went on giving information.</p><p>Sheela was not a criminal. When I chose her as my secretary she was
an innocent woman of great intelligence, but the American politicians
destroyed her innocence. Whatever they were doing, she had to do as a
counterattack, as a defence. All her crimes are basically the crimes of
American politicians which she repeated -- just to save the commune.</p><p>I have nothing but compassion and sadness for her. She is not a
criminal and whatever she did, there was no bad intention in it. She
even bugged my own room; she bugged two hundred houses. Naturally,
logically, it seems that she was even trying to find out what I do in my
privacy, what I say in my privacy. That is not true. The truth is that
she wanted to be alert because I lived in a house alone. If in the night
anybody opened the doors, which were of glass, her bugging would inform
her immediately and she could reach there. It was for my protection, not
against me. She never did anything against me or against the
commune.</p><p>I know she would have died for me, she loved me -- not the kind of
love that you have shown me. Your love is simply cunning. You say you
are my lover, old lover, but all these years you have been writing
articles so ugly and obscene that you should be behind the bars, not
asking questions to me.</p><p>So drop the idea of failure. We succeeded -- it was the first commune
in the whole history of man which succeeded. And remember one thing
about human jealousy: it is never jealous of failure. Have you seen
anybody jealous of failure? Jealousy is always of success. Seeing a
beggar on the street, do you feel jealous? But seeing a rich man's
skyscraper you feel jealous.</p><p>It is a strange mind, undeveloped, retarded. If the same building
catches fire you will feel sympathetic, you will say to the man, "We all
have sympathy for you. It was bad, it should not have happened." And all
the time, when the building was there, every day you had thoughts
against the building and against the man who had made it.</p><p>Who is jealous of India? I have been around the world, I have not
found anybody jealous of India. But I have found people who are jealous
of Gautam Buddha, who are jealous of Krishna, who are jealous of Nanak,
who are jealous of Kabir. Because these diamonds that we created, their
countries have not been able to produce, even to imitate. In all the
languages of the world there are not words which can be compared to
Nanak or Kabir. There are not scriptures which can be compared to
Dhammapada and Gita.</p><p>If the commune was a failure it would have been still alive, but it
became a success and nobody can tolerate a success.</p><p><br></p><p>IN THE PRESS CONFERENCE YESTERDAY YOU SAID YOU ARE DISILLUSIONED AND
YOU WANT THE THIRD WORLD WAR. BUT SOME</p><p>PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND ME AND MILLIONS OF OTHERS ARE NOT EVILDOERS. WE
WANT TO SURVIVE. WHAT IS THE WAY? WHAT IS THE SORT OF NEW CREATION YOU
ENVISAGE?</p><p>First, you hear only what you want to hear. You don't hear me. I have
not even used the word `evildoers'. I have not used the word `evil' at
all. How have you heard it?</p><p>I have not said that I am not an evildoer and certainly I have not
said that you are not an evildoer! You must be! This idea is arising out
of your own heart. I had said that I would like meditators, sannyasins,
people who are interested in raising their consciousness, to work hard
before the world disappears in nuclear destruction. I said that you are
not only a body; your body will be destroyed but your being will be
transplanted to another planet. There are fifty thousand planets in the
whole span of the universe where life exists. This tiny earth is
nothing. But you never heard this; you have made the question out of
your own mind.</p><p>As far as the second part of your question is concerned: when you
were not born were you worried about the world? Were you worried about
what is happening in the world, whether people are living peacefully,
lovingly? If before your birth you were not concerned with the world,
after your death you will not be concerned. Where were you before your
birth? -- you must have been somewhere because nothing is destructible.
So even if this whole earth is destroyed you will be somewhere. I am not
concerned about that. My concern is that while you are here use this
time -- which is very short -- perhaps five years, ten years, at the
most fifteen years.</p><p>This world cannot be saved, but you can be saved. And that is a
totally different thing. If you can achieve a realization of your
consciousness, then your being is saved. Then wherever you are you are
in bliss, whatever the planet.</p><p>This is the experience of centuries, that a man who becomes
enlightened like Buddha, Mahavira, Bodhidharma is not born again
anywhere. Their soul becomes part of the universal soul. You can call it
God, you can call it Brahma, you can call it the Absolute, the Ultimate.
This has been the search of this country, its intensive search for
almost ninety thousand years: how not to be imprisoned into a body
again, because the body is a prison, a very strange prison</p><p>-- it moves with you. Wherever you go you take your prison with
you.</p><p>Our whole religious development is how to get rid of this prison and
how to be in a state of splendor, universality, how to become one with
existence. That is the real aim of life.</p><p>So what I had said was, I am going to work for those who are really
concerned with their being. I am not going to waste my breath on the
dead, blind, unconscious humanity which is simply preparing its own
suicide. Let them succeed -- they will be born on some planet, in some
form. They cannot be worse than they are right now. Can you think of
anything worse than yourself?</p><p>A rosebush is far better than you -- at least it has its perfume. A
bird on the wing is far better than you -- at least it has the freedom
of the whole sky, needs no passport, no entry visa. It does not belong
to any church; is not Christian, is not Hindu. Wherever you will be you
cannot fall below where you have already fallen.</p><p>What I had said was totally different. I had said that looking around
the world, seeing the real faces of people, not their masks, I am no
more interested in humanity and I am no more interested in this planet
earth. I am interested only in those few individuals who want to achieve
to universal consciousness.</p><p>Where the body disappears you are simply a consciousness, a pure
consciousness, satchitanand, you are truth, you are consciousness, you
are bliss.</p><p>I said to you that for ninety thousand years this country has been
persistently searching for only one goal. It is Christianity that has
given the wrong idea to the educated people of the country. The
uneducated people of course don't have any idea, but the educated people
have been told that your Vedas are only five thousand years old. This is
a great lie. Christianity believes that God created the world only six
thousand years ago, so they have to fix the whole evolution within a six
thousand year framework. That is absolute stupidity.</p><p>In the Rigveda we have evidence that there were certain stars in the
sky ninety thousand years ago. They are described in detail. Since then,
they have disappeared. Now science accepts that these stars were there
ninety thousand years ago. Now how can a man five thousand years ago,
without any scientific instruments, write about these stars in such
detail unless they were seen? RIGVEDA is at least ninety thousand years
old, perhaps more. And for these ninety thousand years our only search
has been how to get out of this prison.</p><p>What are you in your body? -- just go to a medical college to see the
bones that you are hiding under the skin. The skin is only a cover,
under the skin there are only bones. Even a doctor, a friend of mine,
was afraid to keep the whole inner structure of bones in his clinic. He
said, "It makes people afraid to come." So he was hiding it at his
house. That created another trouble, his wife was against it.</p><p>But I told him, "Whether you keep it in the house or not, you are
keeping it within yourself, your wife is keeping it, everybody is
keeping it."</p><p>We have never been interested in that, our interest is totally
different. Our interest is in finding who is hidden behind these bones
-- the intelligence, the consciousness. So if the world disappears into
the smoke of a nuclear war nothing is lost, just skin and bones -- which
are going to be lost anyway.</p><p>Right now you lose them individually. Politicians, out of compassion,
are preparing a collective death. Why bother to die individually when we
can die altogether?</p><p>There are already so many nuclear weapons that every man can be
killed seventy times, and they are going on piling them up. Sooner or
later it is all going to explode, it cannot be avoided.</p><p>I have been trying my whole life that it should be avoided, but
seeing the politicians around the world I have changed my position. I
say it should not be avoided, it is better to get through it once and
for all, to be finished with it.</p><p>Those who can experience their inner self will dissolve into the
universal self; those who cannot, will find in fifty thousand planets
some other cage, some other imprisonment -- but I don't see that there
is any trouble.</p><p><br></p><p>JAIL IS A TERRIBLE THING. YOU HAVE NEVER SPOKEN ON THE PSYCHOLOGY OF
THE JAILS. IN THE JAILS DID YOU FEEL BETTER MENTALLY, OR MISERABLE?</p><p><br></p><p>Every person is in a jail, not only in one jail but many jails. First
your body is a jail, then your ideology is a jail, your politics is a
jail, your church is a jail. Chains upon chains; it does not matter that
a few more chains are added.</p><p>In my twelve days in American jails, one day in an English jail, one
day in a Greek jail, I loved it. I loved it for the simple reason that
it was not affecting me at all. I was as blissful as ever; that gave me
a tremendous confirmation that my bliss cannot be taken away from
me.</p><p>If an American jail cannot take it away from me, then no hell can
take it from me</p><p>-- that's what I said to the American jailer in whose jail I was for
the first three days. He was surprised that I was not worried; in fact I
had never had such a time -- twenty-four hours of meditation, no
disturbance.</p><p>I said, "Why should I be disturbed? Just because chains are on my
hands, chains are on my legs, chains are on my waist -- why should I be
disturbed? My body is a jail, on that jail you have put a few more
ornaments. I am perfectly happy." My bliss was absolutely confirmed,
because an American jail is the most refined way of torturing
people.</p><p>I said, "You have freed me from the idea that if I fall into hell
there will be a problem. If I can manage an American jail there is no
reason why I cannot manage an old, out-of-date bullock cart type hell
where no improvement has happened since the beginning. I would love to
visit it."</p><p>I was perfectly happy, but I was certainly not happy about millions
of people who are in jail and suffering for no reason except that they
are black.</p><p>Now the difference between a black man and a white man is so small.
In the old days the difference used to be near about four anas. Now
prices have gone high -</p><p>- it may be a difference of one rupee. And remember, that difference
is in favor of the black man. The black man has a pigment of color which
makes him worth one rupee more than the white man. That black pigment of
color protects him from the sun, the white man is unprotected. God seems
to be more concerned to protect the black man than the white. The white
man's body is weaker, the black man's body is stronger.</p><p>It was a surprise to me, whenever I entered a jail in America there
were black people behind bars who had seen me on the television, because
in every jail there</p><p>are televisions. And they were showing me the two fingers of victory.
They were talking in their own languages which I don't understand, but
this language I can understand. They were saying,"Your victory is our
victory and we are going to be victorious," because all the sins are on
the white man. He has tortured the whole human earth for three hundred
years, sucked its blood, has been a parasite. He should understand it,
confess his guilt, be humble and help these people whom he has made
poor.</p><p>These black people in American jails filled me with tears; those
tears were for their freedom. We have done enough harm to them, it is
time they should be compensated.</p><p>But as far as I am concerned I was absolutely blissful; just as I am
blissful here, I was blissful there. Space makes no difference in your
state of being, nor does time make any difference, nor life, nor
death.</p><p>THERE HAS BEEN SO MUCH DISAPPOINTMENT WITH SO MANY SPIRITUAL LEADERS
OVER SO MANY YEARS. WE HAVE STILL HOPE IN YOU. WHAT IS YOUR SOLUTION TO
THIS THING?</p><p><br></p><p>Worship creativity, worship those who are making this world a little
more beautiful, worship those who are filling the world with a little
more music, a little more song, a little more dance.</p><p>I want to change the definition of sannyas from renunciation to
rejoicing. We have forgotten even to laugh, because no saint laughs --
have you seen any statue of Jesus laughing? Mahavira laughing? No.
Saints are not allowed to laugh. The whole country has become sad.</p><p>I preach life, I preach love, I preach laughter and I preach
creativity. I am against renunciation of anything except stupidities,
superstitions.</p><p>I teach one humanity -- together we can make this country its old
self again. We have to make it! Otherwise, by the end of this century
fifty percent of your people will be dying and hungry all around you.
You will be in a graveyard, not in a country. And just think: if fifty
percent of the people are dying around you, what kind of life can you

which has not been published, as of August 1992.]</p><p>INTERVIEW BY MATHIARTA REVIEW</p><p><br></p><p>DO YOU BELIEVE IN ASTROLOGY? IS IT TRUE THAT AN ASTROLOGER PREDICTED
TO YOUR FATHER THAT YOU WOULD NOT SURVIVE MORE THAN SEVEN YEARS, BUT IF
YOU SURVIVED YOU WOULD BECOME A BUDDHA?</p><p><br></p><p>I have survived -- that's enough proof that astrology has no truth.
Astrology is man's weakness, because he cannot see the future and he
wants to see it. He is always afraid to go astray. He wants to be
certain that he is on the right path, yet the future is absolutely
unknown, nothing can be predicted about it. But there are people who are
always ready to exploit man's weaknesses.</p><p>In life, only one thing is certain and that is death. Everything else
is uncertain, accidental. Man would have loved death to be uncertain and
everything else to be certain. Astrology is his effort to make life a
certainty.</p><p><br></p><p>I am reminded of an old story. A great king dreamt that a black
shadow was standing before him. Even in the dream he began trembling out
of fear. He asked the shadow, "What is the point of making me so afraid
in my sleep?"</p><p>The shadow said, "It is for your benefit. I am your death, and
tomorrow evening when the sun is setting I will come to meet you again.
Just out of compassion I have come to tell you. You have been a good
man. This is an exception -- I never tell people when they are going to
die. So you have twelve hours -- if you want to do something, do it!
This is your last day."</p><p>He became so afraid that he woke up, and the dream disappeared. He
was perspiring all over. It was not a dream, it was a nightmare, and
there was confusion in his mind whether there was any truth in it or
not. In the middle of the night he called all the astrologers of the
capital to find out the meaning of the dream. They came with their
scriptures, different schools of astrology, and they began to discuss
among themselves, fight among themselves.</p><p>By the time the sun was rising the old servant of the king, who was
almost like his father, because his father had died when he was a child
and this old man had taken every care of the boy, protected him,
protected his kingdom, enthroned him. The king had great respect for the
old man. The old man whispered in his</p><p>ear, "If you can listen to me, my suggestion is that these fools that
you have gathered here will never come to any conclusion till the very
end of time. They have been discussing for centuries. Their discussion
is refined, their expertise is tremendous, but what you need is not
their great scholarship but a certain conclusion, and there is not
enough time. My suggestion is: you have the best horse in the world.
Take the horse; at least escape from this palace and this capital, as
far away as possible."</p><p>It appealed to the king. He left the astrologers to discuss and he
escaped from the palace. When death is facing you, you don't feel
thirsty, you don't feel hungry, you don't feel any need for rest. He
wanted to go as far away as possible. He crossed the boundaries of his
kingdom -- by the time the sun was setting he had reached hundreds of
miles away to a beautiful garden. When he was tying the horse to a tree,
he thanked the horse, and he said, "I knew that you were the best horse
in the whole world, but you have proved it. You have come with the speed
of the wind and you have taken me out of all fear. What those
astrologers could not do, you have managed to do it."</p><p>And at that very moment the sun set and he felt a hand on his
shoulder. He looked back -- the old black shadow that he had seen in the
dream was standing there, and said, "Your horse is really the best. Not
only should you thank him, I also thank him, because I was very much
worried. This is the place and this is the time where you have to die
and I was worried how you would reach here. Your horse is a wonder: he
brought you to the right point, at the right time."</p><p>Your whole life you are afraid of death. You keep yourself engaged,
you don't want to recognize the fact that death is following like a
shadow and nobody knows what is going to happen the next moment. People
live in the world as if they are here forever and they know perfectly
well that nobody is here forever. But these fearful people, fearful of
death, of disease, of failure, become victims of cunning people.</p><p>Astrology is an exploitation. And not only does it exploit you, it
gives you a great egoistic idea also -- as if millions of light years
away stars are interested in you, as if their movements decide and
determine your fate. This way, a small man becomes the center of the
whole universe. The astrologers satisfy your ego, dispel your fears, but
the science is absolutely bogus.</p><p>It is better, more courageous and spiritual, to remember that we are
very small -- as small as a blade of grass. And to recognize the fact
that it is good that the future is not determined, otherwise you would
not have any freedom.</p><p>Astrology is against freedom. If tomorrow is decided, then I am a
machine, not a man. Only machines should consult astrologers, not
men.</p><p>Man's future is open and an open future gives freedom, freedom to
create yourself. Astrology does not give you the freedom -- it is the
greatest slavery. Every minute detail is written and there is no way to
change it -- it will happen</p><p>the way it was determined. It has reduced man to a puppet, a puppet
of blind forces.</p><p>I absolutely deny the validity of astrology because I am against all
slavery. My whole effort is to make you aware of your freedom.</p><p>If astrology is right then Gautam Buddha, Kabir, Dadu, do not deserve
any respect. It was determined; they had to become what they became. So
what is great in it? And murderers do not need to be condemned. Just as
Buddha is a puppet, the murderer is a puppet, and both are in the hands
of... we know not, we are not aware of those hands.</p><p>No, I deny this determination. I want to say to you that the
achievement of Buddha or Kabir or Nanak is their own achievement. It is
their creation, it is their effort, it is their struggle. And they
deserve all respect for it.</p><p>And the murderer, the rapist, the criminal -- they are also creating
themselves. They could have created themselves as a buddha, but they
decided to create themselves as a murderer. The whole responsibility is
theirs. Astrology takes away your responsibility. Anything that takes
away responsibility from man is dangerous because responsibility is our
very soul, responsibility is our very glory. Without responsibility we
are just robots. With responsibility arises human freedom.</p><p>There is no science of astrology and there can never be. It is
against man's spiritual growth, it is against man's freedom, it is
against man's humanity.</p><p><br></p><p>WHAT ABOUT PALMISTRY? WHAT ABOUT THOSE LINES?</p><p><br></p><p>Those lines have nothing to do with the future. We can cut both your
hands off -- still there will be a future. We can do plastic surgery and
remove your whole skin -- still there will be a future. Those lines are
simply the fold marks of your hand.</p><p>But we want to be irresponsible. Deep down we want somebody else to
take the responsibility. Some god should take the responsibility and
write your fate.</p><p>In India you read the hand's lines, but have you ever read the lines
of the feet? Why are you neglecting them? But there are in existence a
few aboriginals who don't read the lines of the hand, they read the
lines of the feet, and by that they think they are trying to find their
future in darkness. These are just stupid consolations. And you can see
it happening everywhere -- in different ways you can try it.</p><p>We make the birth chart and we decide according to the birth chart
which man is suitable to marry a certain woman. But all your birth
charts have gone wrong, because nobody seems to suit anybody.</p><p>I have never come across a husband who is happy with his wife. He may
be happy with another's wife, but with the other's wife his birth chart
does not suit. I have never come across a woman who is happy with her
own husband. But great astrologers, scholars, palmists have
decided.â¦</p><p>I used to live in Raipur. Living just in front of me was an
astrologer, the best in Raipur. His fees were very high and every day
there was a crowd of people asking him about their sons' and daughters'
marriages. One day I told him, "You are deciding the future of other
people. What about yourself?" Because his wife used to beat him!</p><p>He said, "It is all business. I don't know what these lines mean,
they don't mean anything at all. My whole life I have been matching --
but nothing matches."</p><p>A deep desire not to take responsibility is behind the whole game,
and the man who is not ready to take responsibility has refused to be a
man -- he has fallen from human dignity.</p><p>Once another astrologer was very much interested in reading my hands,
my birth chart. I said, "I don't have any birth chart, but hands you can
read. But before you read my hands look carefully at your hands."</p><p>He said, "Why?"</p><p>I said, "That will be decided later on." He worked hard, consulted
his scriptures and then he said many things. I said, "Thank you."</p><p>He said, "What about my fees?"</p><p>I said, "I told you that before reading my hands you should look at
your own hands. You should have seen that this man is not going to give
you the fees. If you cannot predict such a small thing, and so urgent,
then everything else must be meaningless."</p><p>Man is born as a tabula rasa -- plain unwritten freedom. And this is
his glory. A dog can only be a dog and nothing else -- that is
determined. A dog has a fate, all your astrologers should move towards
dogs, cats and all kinds of animals; they have a determined nature. If
you study a buffalo you will see that she will not eat any kind of
grass, only a particular grass.</p><p>Man has risen above the animals, and the basic evolution in man is
that he has freed himself from all fetters that blind him. He is totally
free to create himself, whatever he wants to be. Every opportunity is
available. He can reach to the highest peak of consciousness, he can
fall to the lowest depth of darkness. He carries both heaven and hell
within him. But except himself, nobody else can decide it and nobody
else can predict it.</p><p>In Bombay, a few friends brought a great and famous astrologer. I
said to the astrologer, "You can predict only for one year from today,
and I will tell you in writing that whatever you predict I will do
absolutely the opposite. Even to the point that if you say that I will
live a long life, I will die. But I will not support any slavery."</p><p>The man looked around at the people who had brought him and said,
"Where have you brought me? This man is dangerous. If he commits
suicide, I will be caught. Why did you tell him that he would live long,
when he has said that he will do exactly the opposite?"</p><p>I said, "Just for a small experiment you can say that I will not hit
you and I will hit you right now. That will be decisive."</p><p>He was very angry. I said, "That does not matter. What matters is
that my actions are my actions and I take the whole responsibility of my
actions. Good or bad, but I do not want to throw them on the shoulders
of God, fate, kismet, all that nonsense. It is time that we should get
rid of it. It has kept this country poor because what can you do? --
your poverty is written in the stars. You cannot stop the growing
population. What can you do? -- children are sent by God. You don't take
any responsibility for anything. Without responsibility there is no
freedom, and without responsibility you fall down to the level of
animals, not man.</p><p>Astrology is for animals, not for man.</p><p>YOUR VIEWS ARE ALWAYS CHANGING, NOT CONSTANT. SO AS OF TODAY WHAT ARE
YOUR VIEWS ON MAHAVIR AND KRISHNA, ON MOHAMMED AND CHRIST?</p><p>Life is not static. In existence there is only one thing that never
changes and that is change.</p><p>I am not a stone. I move, I change -- these are the symptoms of being
alive. But I always change for the better. I love these people --
Buddha, Krishna, Mahavir -- but my love is not blind. I can see that
these people reached great heights of consciousness, but they have
committed very grave mistakes too. And when a small man commits a
mistake, the mistake is bound to be small. When a man of the height of
Gautam Buddha or Mahavira or Krishna commits a mistake, the mistake is
also as great as the man. And the mistake goes on for thousands of
years.</p><p>I love them because they made a great effort, a tremendous effort to
come out of darkness, of unconsciousness, to reach to the light. But on
the way they also committed a few mistakes.</p><p>The trouble is that the millions of people that have come after them
cannot rise to the heights of their consciousness, but can easily fall
victim to their mistakes. Because to fall is easy, to rise is very
difficult -- it is a uphill task.</p><p>People have a mind that says a man is either good or bad. People
think in terms of either/or; that's not right. A bad man may have
something which is beautiful and great, and a good man may have
something which is ugly and to be condemned. But that does not make any
difference. So first let me make it clear to you that I don't think in
the way of either/or. I take the whole person. Whatever is good I praise
-- but that does not mean that I become blind to things which are not
good.</p><p>Naturally, mind moves like a pendulum from one extreme to another
extreme. I am not an extremist. I praise Gautam Buddha, I praise
Mahavira, but not their extremism. First Krishna created a
destructiveness in the country, then they created a kind of impotence in
the name of nonviolence. For two thousand years you have been slaves --
who is responsible?</p><p>Such a big country, yet small tribes came and ruled over you because
nonviolence became your cherished goal.</p><p>The man of wisdom remains in the middle. He does not do violence to
anybody -</p><p>- but he does not allow anybody to do violence to him either. Because
in both ways he is supporting violence.</p><p>Seeing this happening, Sikhism was born, which is exactly in the
middle. There is no question of violence as a goal, or nonviolence as a
goal; but giving man an insight that to be destructive is bad, to
destroy life is bad, yet to allow anybody to destroy you is the same. So
don't be violent with others; but if somebody is going to be violent
with you then your sword should be with you.</p><p>Sikhism made it a point that five things make a Sikh -- the sword is
one of them. The sword is not to kill anybody but it is just to make
everybody aware that, "We are not vegetables -- if you go on cutting us
we will respond."</p><p>I appreciate Mahavira, a man perhaps never equaled in his struggle to
find himself, a man of tremendous power. But he went to the extreme
again.</p><p>It is good not to have many possessions because all your possessions
become your anxieties and there is no end to it. You can go on and on
and the mind goes on asking for more and more.</p><p>Mahavira was the son of a king, was going to be enthroned, was going
to be the successor. He renounced the kingdom. I do not object to it --
but don't take things to extremes. Renouncing the kingdom is perfectly
good if you don't want to be worried -- and a kingdom is a constant
worry and tension and anguish -- if you want peace and silence and you
want to devote your energies towards inner growth.</p><p>But I cannot support being naked. Clothes are not such a worry. I
have been using clothes, you have been using clothes, and they have
never worried me. So I don't think they are stopping your spiritual
growth. In fact if it is cold and you are not wearing clothes, that will
stop your spiritual growth, that will create tension in you.</p><p>But he went to such an extreme point that he would not use any
instrument, even a razor to shave his beard or his hair. Now a razor is
not an atom bomb. He started pulling out his hair -- that is stupid. And
I want to maintain that even a genius can have a part in him which is
idiotic. Every year he would pull out his hair with his hands because he
could not use any instrument. I don't see any spirituality in it.</p><p>Wherever I see something that goes to help the evolution of
consciousness, I am for it. It does not matter whether it comes from
Mohammed or Moses or Mahavir. Men are unimportant; what is important is
the evolution of consciousness. But there should be a balance, otherwise
the pendulum naturally moves to the other extreme.</p><p>Mohammed gave the name Islam to his religion. Islam means peace, and
Islam has created more turmoil in the world than any other religion.
Certainly Mohammed must be responsible for it. On his sword he has
written "Peace is my</p><p>message." "Peace is my message" is not to be written on a sword,
because the sword is not a message of peace.</p><p>My approach towards all great people who have lived on the earth is
to sort out what is relevant to us and what is not relevant to us.
Mohammedanism was born in a country which was not very sophisticated. It
knew only one logic, the logic of the sword. And the sword is not a
logic. Mohammedanism has remained exactly where it was left by Mohammed
because he said -- and I condemn it -- "I am the last prophet of God.
The Koran is the last amendment in God's previous messages. Now there
will be no other prophets and no other changes."</p><p>Now this is fanatical and whoever said it -- it does not matter who
-- is wrong. Life will go on growing and man will need new messages and
new people to work out new problems. And the Koran is not a great
religious treatise either -- it has not the flights of Upanishads, it
has not the insights of Gautam Buddha. It was natural because Mohammed
was teaching uneducated people, but those uneducated people are still
carrying the same sword in one hand and the Koran in another. Either
accept the Koran or the sword.</p><p>All the Mohammedans that exist in India, all the Mohammedans who have
created Pakistan, are not convinced intellectually that Mohammedanism is
a better religion than the religion they left behind. They have been
forced into Mohammedanism. And religion is one thing that cannot be
forced, should not be forced. Everybody should be allowed to express his
vision and everybody should be allowed either to accept it or not to
accept it. Not accepting it is not insulting. Religion grows only in a
climate of freedom. Mohammedanism has not even given that to
Mohammedans.</p><p>People are puzzled because what I have said yesterday I may not say
today, and what I am saying today I may not say tomorrow. I am a living
being, I am not dead.</p><p>Only when I am dead you can be at ease with me, otherwise you cannot
be at ease with me. You want to quickly cling to anything that comes
into your hands and then you don't want to change it. Fear... but life
is a Ganges, it goes on flowing.</p><p>The real man is always a river. Only dead people are ponds, their
water evaporates, they become more and more muddy, and they are dead
because there is no flow.</p><p>Whatever I am saying today is not going to be contradictory tomorrow,
it will be something higher and better. But to understand the better and
higher you will have to rise to that height, otherwise it will look
contradictory.</p><p>I am a simple man, I don't have any dogma, any creed. I simply have a
clarity. I have eyes to see, and when I see that changes are needed I
don't care what the consequences will be for me -- that's why I have
been unnecessarily condemned by the whole world. Because if I say
anything against Jesus, Christians are angry. You will be surprised --
when I spoke on Jesus a few years ago, many Christian publishers in
Europe and America were eager to publish it. One Christian</p><p>publisher in England published ten books and just a few days ago I
received a letter, "We cannot publish what you are saying now."</p><p>I said, "You have never published anything that I have said. You were
simply publishing because I appreciated the light part of Jesus Christ.
Now I am making the picture complete, the other side has to be shown
too. And you don't have the courage to see the other side."</p><p>In my criticism there is no condemnation of anybody. It is a question
of whether it comes close to truth or not, and no man has the monopoly
on truth. Truth is so vast and we are so small. Truth has so many
facets; at one time we can see only one side. When you see the other
side, if you are a coward you will remain quiet because people will say
that you are now changing your attitude. I am not addicted to any
attitude, any creed. Whatsoever comes to my vision I would like to share
with you.</p><p>I don't want you to agree with me, I don't want you to disagree with
me, I simply want you to be open, available, ready to listen. If there
is some truth in it, it will reach to your heart. If there is not any
truth in it, it will drop on its own accord, it will not reach to your
heart.</p><p><br></p><p>YOU WERE A PROFESSOR IN A COLLEGE, AND EVEN TODAY YOU ARE A TEACHER,
A MASTER. WHAT SORT OF EDUCATION SHOULD BE IN OUR SCHOOLS AND
COLLEGES?</p><p><br></p><p>I have been a teacher, and I left being a teacher in the university
because I cannot do anything against my conscience. And your whole
education is not to help man but to cripple him. Your educational system
is to support the vested interests. I was unable to do it. I refused to
do it.</p><p>A real education will be rebellious because its eyes will be on the
future, not on the past. Nature has not given you eyes behind your head.
If nature wanted you to go on looking at the back it was useless to give
you eyes to look ahead.</p><p>The Indian educational system is still the same as the British
government had imposed on India's mind. Their purpose was to create
clerks, slaves, and the same educational system continues; because now
those who are in power also want clerks, slaves. Nobody wants the truth
to be spoken, nobody wants the future to be created, but only the past
to be exploited.</p><p>I would like to see an educational system that is not devoted to the
government, not devoted to this rotten society, but devoted to the man,
the growing child. Man has a body but your education does nothing for
the man's body. We know that man's body can be trained to remain
healthy, strong, young; but nobody bothers about the body. In education
there is no programme.</p><p>Man has a mind, but education is only concerned to condition the mind
according to those who are in power so it becomes servile. This is
against humanity. Mind should be made clean, sharp, intelligent; but
nobody wants an intelligent mind, nobody wants a sharp consciousness.
They are dangerous</p><p>because these people will not say yes to any nonsense. Education has
to be rebellious in the sense that a man becomes capable of saying yes
or no, on his own accord.</p><p>If too much intelligence is dangerous then every government, every
country wants people to be retarded. Retarded people are obedient.</p><p>I have heard that after the first world war psychologists for the
first time tried to measure man's intelligence. The army was a good
place and they were shocked to see that thirteen years was the average
mental age in the army. The man may have been seventy years old but his
mind had stopped growing after thirteen years. But in the army they
don't want intelligent people.</p><p>In the second world war, a professor was recruited to the army
because there was a shortage of soldiers. The professor said again and
again, "I am absolutely incapable of being a soldier." But nobody
listened to him.</p><p>The first day he was put on the ground and the orders came from the
captain, "Left turn, right turn, turn to the back"... but the man simply
stood where he was standing. The captain was amazed; he knew this man
was a famous professor.</p><p>After the exercise of right turn, left turn, turn back, go forward a
few yards, come back again... when the line was again back in the
original position, he came to the professor who was standing all the
time in his place. He said, "What is the matter with you. Can't you hear
my orders?"</p><p>He said, "I can hear your orders but what is the point? These idiots
went right, went left, went this way, went that way... and finally ended
up in the same position in which I have been standing all the time. And
when you say, `right turn' I cannot simply turn right. I have to
convince myself -- why? Why turn right, why not left? Without a rational
support I cannot turn right or left -- you cannot make me act like a
fool. What is the point of turning right?"</p><p>Nobody had ever asked this of the captain. He said, "This is strange.
I will have to ask the higher authorities what to do with this man. If
he cannot turn right and has to have everything rationally explained...
and what reason can I give? This is just an exercise."</p><p>The professor said, "Exercise I can do at my home. There is no need
to come here in this cold and to do stupid things."</p><p>The higher authorities said, "He is a famous professor. He cannot do
anything without an intelligent, rational support. You send him to me, I
will give him some other work."</p><p>He took him to the army's mess, gave him a big pile of green peas and
told him, "You sit down. Put the big peas on one side, on the other side
the small peas, and after one hour I will come and see what you have
done." After one hour when he came the professor was sitting and the
pile of peas was sitting exactly as he had left it, not even a single
pea was removed. He said, "You have not done anything."</p><p>He said, "There have been so many problems and so many implications."
He said, "Such a simple job! What problems?"</p><p>He said, "The first problem is there are big peas, there are small
peas, but there are also peas which are in between -- where to put them?
And what is the point of all this nonsense. All these peas are going to
be in one pot, big and small, so why bother?" He was released, he was of
no use.</p><p>Every army, in the morning, in the evening, goes on training people.
You think it is training, it is not training! It is simply destroying
their intelligence. It is a preparation so that when the order comes to
shoot they don't think why, they simply shoot. They don't think, "This
man has not done anything to me, why should I shoot him?" The why has
disappeared in the discipline. There is a reason for the discipline, but
it is not only in the army, it is all over the society.</p><p>If you ask your parents about God they have no answer because their
parents never gave any answer to them. They say, "Wait, when you are
bigger you will know."</p><p>One of the friends of my father was thought to be the wisest man in
the town and when I used to ask him he would say, "On each point, just
wait. When you are mature, bigger, you will understand."</p><p>This went on and on. I came from the university, I had been top in
the whole university. I said to him, "Now it is time. I have been top in
the whole university, so what about my questions?"</p><p>He said, "You wait."</p><p>I said, "Now this is going to be too much. I have waited too long. Be
honest, do you know the answers or not?"</p><p>He was an honest man. He said, "To tell the truth, I don't know. This
was just a strategy that has been used for centuries. With you the
difficulty is that you go on asking. Most people as they grow up become
involved in other things and no longer care about these questions, they
forget. And mostly they get married, their children start asking them,
so they start saying, `Wait. When you become bigger you will get the
answer.' The difficulty with you is that you are unmarried."</p><p>I said, "This is strange. Do you think marriage will solve the
problems? I cannot see that by getting married I will know what God is,
otherwise all those who are married would know. You have been thrice
married, you must have known all the mysteries."</p><p>He said, "I don't know anything. But this is how to get rid of
children, otherwise they will torture you."</p><p>But this does not help their intelligence. It would have been better
if they had said, "We don't know. We ourselves are searching ." That
would have been honest, that would have been religious. This is cunning,
this is not religious.</p><p>The whole society is living in hypocrisy. You don't know God, still
you worship. You don't know anything, still you are ready to answer
because those answers have been given to you. So you are simply
repeating them like parrots.</p><p>I would like an educational system which does not give you answers
but makes your questions sharper, makes your intelligence keener, and
gives you an integrity.</p><p>Your body should be taken care of, your mind should have a clarity,
and your soul -- which is completely neglected, nobody mentions it.â¦ You
should be allowed to meditate, you should be taught how to be silent.
And silence is neither Hindu nor Mohammedan nor Christian, silence is
just silence. You should be helped to become a deep silence inside so
that you can understand your own self.</p><p>That will make you a religious individual, without teaching you about
God, without teaching you about things which even idiots will doubt. You
will not be made into a Mohammedan, you will not be made into a
Christian or a Jaina or a Sikh, but you will be made into an integrated,
healthy, conscious, intelligent, centered, well-rooted individual. But
that goes against all the powers because they cannot then enslave
you.</p><p>All other things that are being taught can be taught, but these
things should be added. An education that does not create individuality
is not education at all, it is miseducation.</p><p><br></p><p>IS THERE ANY RELIGION OR SPIRITUALITY IN HAVING NINETY-THREE
ROLLS-ROYCES, DIAMONDS, AND ALL SUCH THINGS? AND IS THERE ANY
SPIRITUALITY OR RELIGION IN WOMEN UNDRESSING IN THE COMPANY OF MEN? IS
IT REALLY NECESSARY?</p><p>There is only spirituality, there is no religion. Religion is only
another name for it. It is better to call it spirituality because it is
less contaminated. The word</p><p>`religion' has become contaminated. The moment you say religion the
idea arises of Hinduism, Mohammedanism, Christianity -- that is the
contamination. The word is beautiful but it has been polluted.</p><p>Spirituality is still unpolluted. When you hear the word
`spirituality' it has no adjective to it, although the basic experience
is the same. Spirituality means that you know that you are not only the
body, that you are not only the mind; that body and mind will die
because they were born. You were before your birth and you will be after
your death -- and this experience comes while you are alive if you can
enter into yourself in silence, in meditation.</p><p>Spirituality is not a renunciation. It is not renouncing the world,
it is transforming the world. Spirituality does not mean poverty,
spirituality means you are inwardly rich and every effort should be made
so that you are outwardly also rich, because there is no
contradiction.</p><p>There is no need to go to the Himalayas and sit in a cave to meditate
when in your house you can make a small air-conditioned cabin,
soundproof, which will be far better than any cave in the Himalayas. In
the old days there was no other way to find a place where there was no
noise, but now you can make it in your home. Every home should have a
small meditation cell -- it should be soundproof, it should be
air-conditioned, so you can sit at ease.</p><p>Spirituality does not mean torturing yourself -- standing on your
head, distorting your body. Leave all that to the magicians.</p><p>Spirituality simply means tranquility -- so deep that you come in
contact with the universal silence that is running within you. And there
is no reason why you should not be rich. In fact, a spiritual person has
more intelligence, more creativity, more understanding -- he can be the
richest person in the world. And his richness will have two dimensions,
the inner and the outer.</p><p>My contribution is that I want it to be clearly understood that outer
richness does not destroy your inner spirituality, neither does outer
poverty help it. A hungry man cannot sit silently. A naked man shivering
in the cold cannot sit silently. And even if you are not hungry, you are
not cold, but you are surrounded by beggars , then too you cannot sit
silently. You have a heart.â¦</p><p>I would like this world to be rich in both ways. And when we can have
the world rich in both ways why choose one? Up to now, this has been the
case -- the West has chosen outer riches, and the East has chosen inner
riches. In other words, the East has chosen outer poverty and the West
has chosen inner poverty. Both are in difficulty, they have everything
and nothing.</p><p>You have the whole art and science of becoming inwardly rich. But you
are so poor that it is difficult in your poverty even to think of the
inner.</p><p>Rudyard Kipling, one of the English poets, has written, "East is
East, West is West, and never the twain shall meet." And I want to say
to you that he is absolutely wrong. Neither West is West, nor East is
East -- it is one earth and the meeting is going to happen, not
geographically but spiritually. If we can accept that inner richness and
outer richness are supportive to each other -- and they are</p><p>-- then there is no reason for any conflict between East and
West.</p><p>I have heard about an American billionaire who got tired of having
all his billions and billions of dollars but no peace. In search of
peace he traveled all over the world, but he could not find a master.
Somebody said, "High on the Himalayas there is a man, perhaps only he
can help you."</p><p>Tired, tattered, somehow he reached to the highest peak and it was
true, an old man was sitting there. Before he could say anything the old
man said, "Have you got a cigarette on you? It has been too long...
nobody comes here. And being a spiritual man, I cannot go down to get a
cigarette. First things first -- have you got a cigarette? Then you can
ask your spiritual questions. Let me enjoy the cigarette, then you can
enjoy the philosophy."</p><p>The man was shocked. He has gone around the world in search of peace
and finally he is ending up with this old idiot who is in search of a
cigarette.</p><p>He took his packet of cigarettes, gave the whole packet. The old man
said, "Great. Now what is your problem?"</p><p>He said, "My problem is I want peace of soul."</p><p>He said, "That's easy. Go home, there is no need to come here. You
can see me, how I have been caught here. You have everything. Let that
everything be there, enjoy it. But don't take the weight of it on your
head. I was also rich but stupid</p><p>saints preached to me, `Renounce everything.' I renounced, and now I
am begging for a cigarette.</p><p>"Don't renounce! Go back! You have everything outside, this is the
time that you can relax; now there is nothing else to achieve in the
outside world. All ambitions fulfilled, now relax, sit silently. And you
have the time, you can afford it. Just remember, when you come next time
bring a few more packets because here cigarettes are absolutely not
available. And don't ask about peace of mind because I don't think about
anything else except cigarettes! That old habit... I have left
everything but how to leave an old habit?"</p><p>Just be intelligent in life. Whatever you have got, use it to create
an atmosphere for yourself so that you can relax. Have a good house,
have all that is beautiful -- paintings, music, art. They don't prevent
you from being spiritual. And surrounded with all this beauty, art,
paintings, find time just to sit silently.</p><p>You are capable of finding it now. In other words, outer richness
should not be taught as a blocking stone but as a stepping stone. So
whatever you have got, if it is enough for your needs then don't bother
for more. You have come to the point from where a new journey
starts.</p><h1 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:6pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=the-last-testament-vol-6-chapter-8>The Last Testament, Vol 6

TAMIL LANKA(*) CONFLICTS HAVE INCREASED? CAN OUR POLITICIANS RESOLVE
THESE PROBLEMS WHICH (INAUDIBLE) SEE THE COUNTRY HAVING?</p><p><br></p><p>A: India has been going through a critical period always. It is not
new. And it is not unfortunate either. Only dead countries don't go
through critical periods. It is just like a living man goes through
critical periods of health of sickness, of poverty of richness. A dead
man is beyond any critical change. Any nation which is dead never goes
through critical phases.</p><p>So the first point I would like to emphasize is, that to pass through
critical phases is a blessing. It means change. It means progress. It
means evolution. I don't look towards critical stages through negative
eyes. To me, it is something very positive, very alive.</p><p>I am reminded of an old saying, that when Adam and Eve, the first
human beings, were thrown out of the paradise of God, Adam said to Eve,
"We are going through a critical stage." Since then, man has been going
on through critical stages.</p><p>Q: (INAUDIBLE) THE GOVERNMENT AND THE POLITICIANS. SO HOW WILL WE
COME OUT OF THIS?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Just wait. Let me first answer your question. Unless you know my
whole answer, any question will be simply an interference. So be
patient. The second point I would like to emphasize is that India has
never been a nation. In the days of Gautam Buddha there were two
thousand kingdoms in India, and I appreciate it. My appreciation is
based on a certain conception of freedom.</p><p>India has always been a metaphor, a philosophical concept, a
spiritual unity, but never a political nation. This allowed different
languages to evolve, different cultures to evolve, different
individualities to evolve, and the country was not monotonous; it was a
beautiful garden of different flowers, different colors,</p><p>different perfumes. And we allowed it, because the variety is
richness. There was an inner current that joined people, but it was not
political; it was spiritual. The Bengali had his own language, his own
culture, his own way of living, his own individuality. The Punjabi had a
totally different language, a totally different way of living and a
totally different way of individuality. They were not the same; but
still remaining individuals independent from each other there was an
inner current of spiritual feeling.</p><p>So India has remained always a spiritual feeling, a spiritual
colorfulness; not the monotonous boring one language, one culture, one
religion. It was unfortunate that India became a slave country, invaded
by many people, and the two invaders particularly -- the Moguls and the
British -- they tried to create a political nation out of a spiritual
freedom. They forced India to become a political nation. It was under
force, under violence.</p><p>Remember these two different concepts. A spiritual feeling is one
thing; it does not make you a slave, it allows you space to be yourself.
But a political, united nation tries to destroy the variety. For
example, Britain imposed English as one language for the whole country.
This was very destructive. It took away the dignity of Bengali, of
Punjabi, of Urdu, of Hindi, of Malayalam. The Mohammedans tried the
same, to impose Urdu as a national language. India is not a nation in
that sense. It is a continent, and it can be kept as a nation only
through violence.</p><p>Winston Churchill, before India became free -- he was no more the
prime minister of England -- made a very pertinent remark. He said, "The
moment Britain leaves India, it will fall apart into pieces." He was
right. He knew that India's remaining a nation is forced; it is not an
inner growth. And that's what happened. The moment India became
independent, first it was divided into two countries -- Pakistan,
Hindustan; then Bangladesh separated from Pakistan. Now the same is
being done by the Sikhs, the same desire to be independent, and I don't
see there is anything wrong in it. I would like to see India a spiritual
unity, but I would not like it to remain forced into a political
nation.</p><p>But the political leaders would like it to remain one country,
because bigger the country is, the bigger is their power. It would be a
far more beautiful land if Bengalis, Punjabis, Tamils, and other
linguistic groups, particularly as far as politics is concerned, are
totally independent. I would love to see India have thirty prime
ministers and thirty presidents. It will not be a loss. I would love to
see India in the UNO having thirty seats. Why just one vote? You can
have thirty votes. And the spiritual unity remains. From South India,
from the North, from the East, from the West, they all come together in
a Kumbhamela in Prayag to have a dip in the holy Ganges. Their soul
remains one.</p><p>It will be a great day when India becomes not a political nation --
as it is now it is British heritage, it is part of the British slavery
-- but becomes a confederation of independent nations. You can see in
simple matters. After forty years you have not been able to make a
single national language, and I say you will not be able</p><p>in four thousand years either. And there is no need, because each
language has its own flavor, has its own beauty. Why should one language
be imposed on other languages? Why should one religion be imposed on
other religions? Why should one particular kind of personality be
imposed on the whole of India? Why make it a monotonous continent?</p><p>But the politicians cannot solve the problem. Their problem is not
the problem of the country, it is not the problem of you. It is their
own ambition and their own ego. Now you have one president, one prime
minister. If India becomes a confederation, a spiritual congregation,
naturally politicians' power will be reduced. And whoever gets to the
power does not want to lose it. He wants to increase it, at whatever
cost.</p><p>I have moved around the country many times, and I see the beautiful
variety of languages, of clothes, of food, of culture, of character.
Don't bulldoze it. Urdu has its own refined etiquette. Bengali has its
own music, which no other language can replace. Bengali has its own
literature, which has risen to the highest peaks. The same is true about
other languages, different dimensions.</p><p>Your question is: why are castes, creeds, falling apart? They have
always been separate. They were forced on the point of guns to remain
within a political unity. Why were you so much interested in being
independent from Britain? What was the point? They were doing perfectly
well, they were experienced. The whole freedom fight loses meaning. But
no, you wanted to have your own identity. And when Bangladesh was trying
to be separate from Pakistan -- which was a natural phenomenon, there
was nothing common between Pakistan and Bangladesh, except their
religion.â¦</p><p>So religion does not need any political unity. Religion is
individual. It is your communion with the divine. But Bangladesh had its
own language, its own culture, its own poetry, its own music. It was
destructive to remain with Pakistan, because Pakistan has none of those
qualities, it has its own ways. And you see the mind of politicians:
Indira Gandhi helped Bangladesh to be separated from Pakistan. Now these
are double standards. Now Punjab wants to have its own independence, the
same principle should be followed. They have their own religion, they
have their own dances, they have their own songs, they have their own
literature, and they would like to be free from all the burden of other
people. You can see, the Sikh has a personality of his own, and his
demand to be independent has to be supported by all freedom loving
people.</p><p>Instead of supporting them, Sikhs are being killed, their holy temple
has been captured by the military. In retaliation they are killing
Hindus, and it is such a strange thing because they have lived for five
hundred years in one of the most beautiful ways. It has not happened
anywhere else in the world. In the same family the husband may be a
Hindu, and the wife may be a Sikh, or vice versa. The father may be a
Sikh and the son may be a Hindu. There was no problem.</p><p>Religion is an individual affair. Nowhere in the world, in the same
house you will find two religions. That strange flowering has happened
in Punjab. And you</p><p>can see how small things make such a difference, because five hundred
years ago they were all Hindus, accepting the teachings of Nanak,
accepting a different individuality, a different psychology. Now you can
see, the Sikh and the Hindu are totally different.</p><p>I have come in contact with every culture in India. You can rely on a
Sikh. He is the most sincere in this whole country. Just the change of
language, the change of religion, the change of living has created a
totally different kind of man -- and a beautiful man. And I love
variety; I don't want that the whole world should be full of rose
flowers. Rose flowers are beautiful, but if the whole world is full of
rose flowers they will lose their beauty. Millions of types of flowers
are there. That makes the world rich.</p><p>And what has happened in Punjab is going to happen in other parts of
the country too, sooner or later. It happened in Punjab first because
they have guts. In five hundred years they have created a brave man, a
warrior, a certain discipline, a certain readiness to die for any cause
they think is worth dying for. That's why they are the first; and you
will not be able by your army and by your ugly forces to repress it.
Either Sikhs will remain an independent country, or they would like to
die completely. While the last Sikh remains, their fight will continue.
And for that fight, they are not responsible.</p><p>Please note this point: they are not responsible for the fight. They
had simply asked for freedom. It could have been given lovingly, and
they would have remained your friends. You have created the enemy in
your own home. Whoever wants to be free, help him to be free, because
freedom is the ultimate value. Help him to stand on his own feet so that
the spiritual connectedness of these people remains the same. If my idea
is understood correctly, and is not corrupted, distorted, then even
Pakistan and Bangladesh will become part of the greater India, a
confederation.</p><p>India can only be a continent, it can never be a nation. They can all
be together as far as their defence is concerned. Except defence, they
can be absolutely independent. For their growth, they can have their own
national language, they can have their own national character.</p><p>You are asking why suddenly this is happening. It is not happening
suddenly. The force that was keeping you together is no more there. It
was the slavery that was keeping you together. It is freedom that is
allowing you to be on your own. Why hang with each other? And is
economically sane too.</p><p>If India becomes thirty nations, the burden of problems is divided.
It is no more on one nation. Those thirty nations will find their own
solutions of their own problems. Freedom brings responsibility. This is
one reason.</p><p>Second reason, Hindus for five thousand years after Manu and his ugly
book MANUSMRITI have lived in a strange way. It is only in India that
caste system exists. Its implications are very significant. You are born
a brahmin. You may not have a single quality of a brahmin, but you will
be worshipped. You are born a sudra. You may have the quality of a
brahmin.</p><p>The Indian constitution was not made by a brahmin; it was made by Dr.
Ambedkar, who was a sudra. He was called to make the constitution
because he had the keenest intellect as far as law and constitutions are
concerned. Shankaracharyas were not called.</p><p>Birth decides nothing. Your actions, your life, your character is
decisive. But Hinduism has remained divided according to birth. It has
no mobility, no movement. A sudra cannot become a brahmin. This is ugly.
A vaishya cannot become a warrior. Lines are drawn from the very birth.
The society has lived in a dead way.</p><p>Life needs movement.</p><p>If a sudra can attain to wisdom, he should be a brahmin; and if a
brahmin can make beautiful shoes he should be a sudra. And there should
be no question who is higher and who is lower. The question should be
whether your shoes that you make are artistic, stable(*).</p><p>I am reminded of Abraham Lincoln, when he became the president of
America. He could have never become the president of India. Although
Mahatma Gandhi all his life told a lie, that the first president of
India will be a sudra. But when India became free, he completely forgot
about it. Not only a sudra, but a sudra woman would be the first
president.But nobody bothered about it. Neither he mentioned about it.
It was simply political (inaudible). A lie that politicians are expert
in spreading to win the votes, the support of the sudras.</p><p>Now for the first time, sudras are allowed in the schools. They were
not allowed; for five thousand years they were not allowed even to
listen to religious scriptures.</p><p>There was no possibility of Abraham Lincoln to become a president of
India, and he was one of the best presidents that the world has
produced. But he was a sudra according to Hindu (inaudible)
classification. He was a son of a shoemaker, and even in America people
were offended. Aristocrats, millionaires, and the son of a shoemaker.
Before he gave his first address to the senate, one senator, just to
make a mockery of him, stood up, and said, "Mr.Â Abraham Lincoln, by
chance you have become the president, but don't forget who you are. Your
father used to make shoes for me, for my family, always remember that,
that you are a shoemaker's son."</p><p>Abraham Lincoln was a rare man. His eyes were filled by tears. He
said, "I am grateful to you, that you reminded me about my father. I
know perfectly well that I cannot be a better president than he was a
shoemaker. He was a better shoemaker than I can ever be a better(*)
president. He was a better man than me. He was a perfect (inaudible) and
I want to ask you why, suddenly, my father's name has come to your mind.
I can see you are wearing the shoes which were made by my father.Are
they pinching(*)? I am not a great shoemaker, but from the childhood,
sitting by my father, helping him, I have learned a little art. If
somebody's shoes is giving trouble to anybody, I can mend it. It must be
pinching, otherwise how you remembered? I will come tomorrow morning
to</p><p>your house and repair whatsoever is needed, whatever I can do,
although it will not be so perfect. My father was absolutely perfect,
and I feel, deep down, that I will never be a better president than he
was a better shoemaker."</p><p>The aristocrat was thinking that he is going to create a mockery of
Lincoln. It backfired. There was utter silence in the senate; they had
not expected such answer.</p><p>But in India even the person like Rama, whom you think as a partial
incarnation of God, was after all a Hindu chauvinist. Some brahmin's son
died; now, everybody who is born dies. And that brahmin, came with the
dead body of his son to Rama, and he said, "Something very sinister is
happening in the kingdom, otherwise before the father a son could not
die."</p><p>A great search was made and the brahmin found that a sudra hiding
behind the bushes used to listen to the RIG VEDA that brahmins were
reading. This was the sin. The sudra was brought to Rama. This single
act is enough to reject Rama completely. There is no justice, no
fairness, no relatedness even; but because he has heard the mantra RIG
VEDA which are privated(*), melted lead was poured into both his ears,
so that he can never hear again anything. And this is being done by
Rama.</p><p>People are angry with me on strange things. Truth hurts.</p><p>Now can you call this man an incarnation of God? At least for God
there should be no brahmin, no sudra, no *chhatriya, no vaishya. They
are all his creation. He should be the father of all. And what justice
is there? He destroyed his both ears for his whole life. According to
me, that sudra may have reached paradise, but Rama cannot reach. He
should be in hell. He has to be in hell.</p><p>Now sudras are studying in schools, colleges, universities. Otherwise
how you can produce a Dr.Â Ambedkar? Naturally, the sudras want to be
treated as human beings. You have treated the sudras for thousands of
years as cattle. Even worse. Even the shadow of the sudra, says Manu, is
untouchable. Even the shadow, which does not exist, if the sudra passes
by and his shadow falls on you, you have to take a bath.</p><p>So what difficult times India is passing, are absolutely supported by
me. These are days of revolution, revolution from all kinds of slavery:
political, religious, spiritual.</p><p>No religion accepts women equal to men. Jainism says that a woman
cannot go to heaven directly, she first has to be born as a man, then
she can only reach heaven. But one woman, who must have been of immense
courage, and immense intelligence, attained to enlightenment in this
life; must have been a charismatic personality, that even Jainas has to
accept her as one of their tirthankaras.</p><p>Jainas has a very limited quota -- twenty-four tirthankaras in one
creation. And the creation is billions and billions of light years.
Their twenty-fourth tirthankara has happened. There is no possibility
now for anybody to become a tirthankara. Twenty-fifth tirthankara does
not happen. This woman, whose name was Mallibai, became a tirthankara.
The word tirthankara means `the path finder':</p><p>one who has found the path, traveled the path, reached the goal. But
what ugliness Jainas have done which is unbelievable, they changed the
name in their scriptures of Mallibai to Mallinath, so anybody reading
Jaina scriptures will never have any idea that in twenty-four
tirthankaras there is one woman. Go to a Jaina temple, where twenty-four
tirthankaras' statues are there. All are of men. Not a single statue is
of a woman.</p><p>In my childhood, I asked my father that "On the gate of the temple is
written</p><p>`Satyameva jayate', truth always becomes victorious.But show me in
these twenty-four statues, who is Mallibai? They are all men, there is
no woman (inaudible). You have been cheating, you have been cunning.
Your saints, your scholars, all have been deceiving humanity for
twenty-five centuries to hide a simple fact that if spirituality has
nothing to do with the body, whether you have the body of a man, or a
woman, does not matter. You have the same consciousness. And
consciousness is neither man nor woman.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: I AM SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOU, BUT I HAVE THREE OR FOUR QUESTIONS
AND ONLY ABOUT HALF AN HOUR IS LEFT FOR THE TALK.</p><p><br></p><p>A: I will answer your four questions in four minutes. You don't
interrupt me, because all your questions, other questions, are rubbish.
Only this question was pertinent, and useful for the country. That's why
I am answering it. If this question was not there, you would not have
been here either.</p><p>Q: I HAVE COME FOR AN INTERVIEW; I SHALL COME IN THE EVENINGS FOR A
DISCOURSE BUT YOU HAVE ANSWERED MY FIRST QUESTION, AND I SHOULD BE ABLE
TO GO ON TO THE REMAINING QUESTIONS.</p><p>A: I have not answered it yet. You have come to my interview; you
have to be patient. I am not a politician who can be threatened by a
journalist.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: I AM NOT THREATENING YOU, BHAGWAN, I AM JUST EXPLAINING MY
POSITION, THAT I HAVE COME HERE FOR AN INTERVIEW, WITH A LIST OF
QUESTIONS WHICH YOU HAVE SEEN, AND WE HAVE ONLY HALF AN HOUR OR SO LEFT,
AND I WOULD LIKE...</p><p><br></p><p>A: I know</p><p>Q: ... WHATEVER YOU THINK OF THE QUESTIONS, I WOULD LIKE TO ANSWER TO
THOSE QUESTIONS BEFORE I GO. I MEAN</p><p>A: Okay</p><p>Q: DO YOU SEE YOUR RETURN TO INDIA AS THE END OF THE PHASE OF YOUR
QUEST?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No.Â Because the spiritual quest is an eternal quest. It has no
end. Second question.</p><p>Q: FOR A LONG TIME YOU PROPOUNDED A PHILOSOPHY WHICH ALLOWED FOR FREE
EXPRESSION OF FEELINGS BY DEVOTEES. THE SEXUAL PRACTICES IN YOUR ASHRAM
RECEIVED PARTICULAR ATTENTION FROM THE MEDIA. NOW WITH YOUR
DISILLUSIONMENT WITH MANKIND, DO YOU SEE A CHANGE IN YOUR BASIC
TEACHING?</p><p>A: No.Â I don't see any change in me. And the news media has given
attention to my ideas about sex, because they are all sex maniacs.
Suppressed sex.</p><p>I have four hundred books, and only one book on sex. Three hundred
ninety nine books have received no response from news media. Only one
book... and that book is also not about sexuality; that book is how to
transform sex into superconsciousness. The name of the book is FROM SEX
TO SUPERCONSCIOUSNESS. Nobody from the news media bothers about
superconsciousness. They are simply interested in sex. Sex maniacs.</p><p>Go on, third question.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: BUT WHEN YOU CAME BACK YOU SAID YOU WERE DISILLUSIONED WITH
MANKIND, YOU SAID THAT THE THIRD WORLD WAR WOULD BE A GOOD SOLUTION. SO,
I MEAN, DOES THIS BRING ABOUT A CHANGE IN THE WAY YOU LOOK AT
MANKIND?</p><p>A: No.Â I was not aware about the whole mankind. I was living in this
country, and I was living with my sannyasins. And I thought my
sannyasins represent human beings.</p><p>They certainly represent human beings, because they have dropped
their masks. I had gone for a world tour, to see, and I found that every
human being is hiding behind a mask, is false, is bogus, is not worth
saving. That's why I said there is only one hope for mankind, and that
is a nuclear third world war. This rotten humanity should be finished.
Nobody will be able to say this, what I am saying, because nobody has
the guts to say this.</p><p>Only those who have attained to consciousness from now onwards I will
be interested in them. The remaining humanity for me is already dead. I
am not interested in it.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: (INAUDIBLE) YOU HAD PROBLEMS IN THE U.S. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW
WHETHER IT WAS ALSO BECAUSE OF THE FAILURE OF THE SECTION(*) OF YOUR
DEVOTEES TO LIVE UP TO YOUR TEACHINGS?</p><p>A: No.Â It was the success of my devotees to live up to my standard
that created the problem to the American government. It is always
success that creates problems. Who cares about failure? You are not
jealous of beggars(*), you are jealous of those who have succeeded in
life.</p><p>My commune was the first commune in the whole history of man which
succeeded in every possible way. And that was the trouble with American
government, because Americans they started asking them, that if these
people can live so lovingly, so blissfully, so richly, so
self-sufficiently in a desert, which has not been cultivated, ever, then
what you are doing with billions of dollars? Why America has thirty
million beggars?</p><p>You are trying to reach to moon, and your people are dying on the
streets; thirty million people. And there are other thirty million
people who are dying in hospitals, because they eat too much. So are you
insane or what? Sixty million people can be easily saved within a single
moment; just a little consciousness, that you are eating somebody else'
food, and killing yourself, and killing him. You can save yourself and
save the other person. In my commune there was no currency, there was no
money used, because every need was fulfilled by the commune. If five
thousand people can live without money... I have not seen a single
dollar bill in five years in America. There was no need. We were growing
our food, our milk products, our vegetables, our fruits; we were doing
everything, making our houses, our roads, and we had made the desert
blossom in an oasis.</p><p>This became the problem, not the failure. The success became the
problem. I invited Ronald Reagan, I invited the governor of Oregon, that
just come and see what is happening here. People are working, five
thousand people are eating together in one kitchen, and by the end, as
the sunsets, the whole valley, all the mountains around it, start
filling with dances, flutes, people are singing, dancing, to the
midnight. In the morning they start with meditation, and the night they
fall asleep with music.</p><p>If this can happen to five thousand people, why it cannot happen to
everybody? This was their problem. And just few days before the Attorney
General of America has accepted it unknowingly. He was asked why Bhagwan
was not imprisoned. He answered that "Our priority was to destroy the
commune, because the commune was becoming a problem to us.Nobody could
use money in the commune, so you may be a billionaire, and you may be a
beggar, but nobody was rich, nobody was poor. If you cannot use your
money in the commune, your money is useless. Without enforcing any
dictatorship of the proletariat, we managed to create a higher quality
of communism.</p><p>That was the problem for the American politicians. It became more
problematic than Soviet Union, because Soviet Union is still poor. And
the commune was becoming richer, because everybody was productive, and
everybody was sharing. A commune of five thousand people had five
hundred cars, five</p><p>airplanes, one hundred air conditioned buses, and nowhere to go.
Americans were coming and seeing and they were amazed, that how you had
managed all this? And we had not asked any American to donate, we had
not accepted any American donations. It was sannyasins themselves,
whatsoever they had brought or produced by their work. Our success has
been the problem.</p><p>Q: WHAT DO YOU PLAN TO DO IN INDIA NOW? WILL YOU SET UP AN ASHRAM,
BECAUSE RAJIV GANDHI'S GOVERNMENT HAS DENIED PERMISSION ONCE TO YOU; SO
WILL YOU TRY AND RECREATE THIS ASHRAM IN INDIA?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No.Â I am not going to create any ashram in India. Sannyasins can
create ashrams in India. They are capable now, there is no need for me.
I can inaugurate their ashrams! My work is going to be resting few days
in India, and then moving around the world because I have so many
communes all over the world, in every country. Up to now, sannyasins
were coming to me. That is uneconomical. Now I will be going to each
commune, living four five weeks, whatsoever their government is capable
to tolerate. Here will be my resting place, not an ashram. When all
governments are tired, I will be resting here. But I am not going to
create any ashram or anything. Now sannyasins are perfectly aware what
has to be done, and they are doing.</p><p>Everywhere new ashrams, new communes, are being made around the
world, new centers are opened; and they are all inviting me, because I
have told them not to come here. This is going to be just a resting
place for me. My jet plane will be standing on the airport, and any
moment I will start moving around the world. That way, I will be coming
in contact with more sannyasins, more intimately, living with them. In
short, I am going to change this whole world and this world's
intelligent people into sannyasins, and leaving the responsibility to
create communes and sannyas ashramas on them. And they are doing
perfectly well.</p><p>Just in one country, Germany, there are six communes where thousands
of sannyasins are living. German government is afraid, German parliament
has resolved that I should not be allowed to enter in Germany. They are
not afraid of my entry. They are afraid of the German youth, and the six
communes, because I have at least twenty thousand sannyasins in
Germany.</p><p>Rajiv Gandhi cannot prevent my creating ashramas. I have thousands of
sannyasins in India. If I want to create any ashram, any commune, Rajiv
Gandhi will be risking his own premiership.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THANK YOU.</p><h1 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:6pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=the-last-testament-vol-6-chapter-9>The Last Testament, Vol 6

which has not been published, as of August 1992.]</p><p>Interview by Sunday</p><p><br></p><p>HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THE ESSENCE OF YOUR RELIGION OR PHILOSOPHY?
HAS IT BEEN THE SAME, OR HAS IT EVOLVED OVER THE YEARS? IS IT DIFFERENT
TODAY, AFTER YOUR VAST AND TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCES?</p><p><br></p><p>The first thing: I do not have a philosophy; but I have a totally
different concept of life. I call it `philosia'.</p><p>Philosophy is not the exact translation of what for centuries in
India we have called `darshan', it is a wrong translation. Philosophy
means thinking, and darshan means seeing. The blind man thinks about
light, and the man with eyes sees light.</p><p>In India, philosophy has never existed, because we have never
believed that you can think about truth. You can realize it, you can see
it, you can become it, you can blossom in a world of truth. But there is
no way to think about it.</p><p>Thinking is confined to the mind, and you are far above mind. You are
a soul. Mind can think only about things which it knows; it is a vicious
circle. Mind cannot think about anything which it does not know. There
is no way.</p><p>This was the reason why in the East we never believed in thinking, in
mind. On the contrary, our search has been for a state of no-mind,
no-thinking, a state of silence. It is strange, philosophy is thinking,
and philosia is no-thinking. They are just contraries.</p><p>When all thinking disappears and you are simply a knower, a witness,
a witness of nothing, a knower of nothing, that is the moment of the
great revolution when man becomes a Gautam Buddha. Because when there is
nothing to know, your energies of knowing turn one hundred and eighty
degrees upon yourself, and for the first time you realize who you
are.</p><p>So this is the first thing that I would like to say: I do not have
any philosophy. I have a philosia, and I teach my people how not to
think and just be in a state of no-mind. In other words, be a meditator,
not a thinker. And in meditation we have realized the essential of our
life, and that essential is the essential of the whole existence.</p><p>The greatest difference between East and West is that the West has
never realized truth because it has been moving on a wrong path. A blind
man thinking about light can go on thinking for lives together. He will
still not have any idea what light is. He cannot even think about
darkness -- what to say about light? Ordinarily people think that blind
people must be living in constant darkness. They are wrong, because to
see darkness you need eyes, and the man who can see darkness can see
light too. It is just a question of opening the eyes or closing the
eyes. But the blind man has no eyes at all. He is not part of the world
where darkness exists, where light exists.</p><p>There has been a tremendous mistake. It was natural for the
Westerners to translate darshan as philosophy. But one feels ashamed
that people like Dr.Â Radhakrishna also translate darshan as philosophy.
Just slave minds -- whatsoever the West is doing they will imitate
it.</p><p>Secondly, I do not have a religion either, I have a religiousness.
And I want to emphasize the fact that religiousness is a living quality.
Religion is a dead dogma. Hinduism is a religion, Mohammedanism is a
religion, Buddhism is a religion. But Gautam Buddha is only religious,
not of a religion. Religiousness is just like the quality of love. When
you fall in love with a person it is an experience, a quality -- a
living, vibrating phenomenon. When you fall in love with the whole
existence it is religiousness.</p><p>Religions can be many, religiousness is one, just like love. You
don't have Mohammedan love, Christian love, Hindu love. That would be
hilarious. Love is simply love without any adjectives. So is
religiousness. And I do not teach religion, that's why all the religions
are against me. I teach religiousness.</p><p>Religiousness means a man who is moving away from thinking to
non-thinking, moving from mind to no-mind, moving from body to soul,
moving from the outer to the inner. Ultimately religiousness makes you
the center of a cyclone.</p><p>All around you is a cyclone but you are a silent center, and out of
that silent center has come all beautiful, still, small voices.</p><p>The statements of the Upanishads are not the statements of people who
belong to any religion. They are the statements of people who drown
themselves in religiousness. Anything that is truthful, beautiful, good,
has come out of the experience of religiousness.</p><p>Satyam, shivam, sundram: truth, good, beauty. All the religions have
beliefs, and every belief simply covers your ignorance. From the very
beginning it is a belief -</p><p>- you don't know. It is a blind man believing in light, it is a deaf
man believing in music.</p><p>Religiousness does not begin in belief, it begins in experiencing. It
is an inner journey. And at the innermost core we are all one. The
Korans, the Bibles, the Gitas and the Vedas are all left out. At the
innermost core of your being there is only godliness, no god. I have to
emphasize the fact that religions believe in god, for which they have no
proof, no witness; it is their own invention. That's why there are so
many gods.</p><p>There are three hundred religions on the earth. And if you go into
the details you will be surprised. Hindus have thirty-three million
gods, which was once the population of India -- the same population. It
is indicative that each man invents his own god, his own conception of
god.</p><p>I do not have a God. I do not preach about God because the
implications are dangerous. If there is a God as a creator, you are only
puppets. You lose your dignity, you lose your humanity; you were created
out of mud. And God seems to be whimsical, because what had he been
doing since eternity? Christians say he created the world only four
thousand and four years before Jesus Christ. That God seems to be a
crackpot. What about the time that preceded those four thousand and four
years? What had he been doing? And he is a dangerous God. He can destroy
you this very moment. If he can create you, he can destroy you; you are
not your own masters.</p><p>Friedrich Nietzsche was right when he said, "God is dead. Therefore I
declare man is free." I go one step ahead of Friedrich Nietzsche. Even
to say, "God is dead" is to accept that once he was alive. I say there
has been never a God; he is the invention of the priests to exploit
humanity, to destroy man's freedom. But the second part of his
statement, "therefore man is free" has great insight. It says that if
God is there, there is no freedom possible. And if you want freedom,
then God has to be said goodbye to.</p><p>I teach man godliness. That is a totally different conception. The
qualities of compassion, the qualities of service, the qualities of
love, the qualities of sincerity, the qualities of truth, the qualities
of meditation, all these are aspects of godliness.</p><p>You don't have to worship God. That is simply idiotic, and it is
happening all over the world -- in the temples, in the mosques, in
gurudwaras, in synagogues, in churches. I call it simply stupidity. God
has not to be worshipped, just as love has not to be worshipped. Love
has to be lived, godliness has to be lived. It is not a question of
worship, it is a question of living; godliness is my way of life.</p><p>You have asked, has my way of life been evolving? Anything alive is
always evolving, only dead things don't evolve. I am still alive. Unto
my last breath my philosia, my religiousness, will go on evolving, will
go on becoming deeper, higher, will go on reaching to the stars.</p><p>You have also asked if, after my traumatic experiences, my attitude
to life has changed. No.</p><p>My way of looking at things has deepened. I love now with a great
depth, and my inner godliness has become a dance, a song, a celebration.
Because the traumatic experience has made it absolutely clear to me that
it is not a time just to sit and enjoy my blissfulness in a cave
somewhere in the Himalayas.</p><p>The time of crisis is such that the whole humanity is on the cross.
It is time to reach to every heart, it is time to wake up every sleeping
man. But my philosia and my religiousness are absolutely unaffected.
They are evolving, becoming more and more comprehensive, but nothing is
being dropped. Nothing is being</p><p>edited out or inserted in. My basic standpoint remains the same but
it goes on growing, just like a tree. Even when you see it is standing,
it is really growing.</p><p>Gautam Buddha used to say that we should drop, from our languages,
nouns and pronouns, and I agree with him. He said that life consists of
only verbs. There is no river, there is only rivering. There is no tree,
there is only treeing. Because everything is moving, moving to greater
heights, reaching to greater depths.</p><p>ONE OF THE CONTROVERSIES ABOUT YOUR TEACHING WAS THAT NOTHING WAS
TABOO, PARTICULARLY FREE SEX. IS THIS TRUE, AND IS THIS THE MAIN
CRITICISM AGAINST YOU?</p><p><br></p><p>There is nothing which is taboo, except taboo itself. Life should be
lived in its totality, in its intensity, in its wholeness. To me, to
live life in its wholeness is to be holy, there is no other
holiness.</p><p>It is true that people who are against me have made it a basic point
to criticize me. But the reason is not that I am teaching the wholeness
of life, teaching an uninhibited acceptance of existence, The reason is
that I have been cutting the very roots of all these religions; and they
don't have anything else to condemn, criticize. They don't have any
answer to any of my questions. They have chosen sex, which simply shows
their repression and nothing else. I have over five hundred books, and
only one book talks about sex; all the rest are condemning all these
religions from every angle. They are silent about it because they don't
have any answer.</p><p>So sex has become their focus. They have tried all around the world,
as if sex is my only teaching. And their choice simply shows not only
their repressions, it also shows that for centuries they have been
repressing sex in people.</p><p>It is strange that out of five hundred books that one book on sex...
and that too is not really on sex. The name of the book is FROM SEX TO
SUPERCONSCIOUSNESS. It is basically about how to transform sexual energy
into a superconscious experience. In fact, that is the only way to go
beyond sex, to transcend sex, to sublimate sex. And that book is the
only one that has been translated in almost all the languages of the
world. It shows the sickness of human mind.</p><p>I have heard, one night a man was with a woman in bed, and suddenly
the woman said, "Get up quickly and go in the cupboard and hide; I have
heard the horn of my husband's car. And keep quiet and silent, because
he will not be here long. He has to go on his night duty." The man went
inside the cupboard. And it was true, the husband entered. At that very
moment the man heard someone else in the cupboard with him, a little
boy.</p><p>And the little boy said, "It is very dark here."</p><p>The man said, "For God's sake, don't speak so loudly. Here is five
dollars, keep quiet."</p><p>The boy said, "The darkness is too much."</p><p>The man said, "You can take ten dollars." The man was afraid of the
husband. The boy replied, "It won't do, the darkness is too much and I
am going to scream."</p><p>The man gave fifty dollars -- all that he had. He said, "You can look
into my pockets, I have nothing more. Now if you want to scream, you can
scream."</p><p>The boy said, "That's okay, it will do. For today it will do. But
next time remember, it is below me to accept only fifty dollars."</p><p>The man said, "What do you mean?"</p><p>He said, "This is my business. I am always in this cupboard, and at
least one hundred dollars is my fee. So next time, remember, you will
have to come into the cupboard, and rather than haggling about the
price, simply give me one hundred dollars, and I will be silent."</p><p>The man said, "Okay, but please keep quiet. Now you have got whatever
I had." The next day the young child told his grandmother, "I want to
purchase a tricycle."</p><p>The woman said, "But with what? I don't have any money."</p><p>The boy said, "Don't be worried about money, I have got fifty
dollars." The woman said, "Fifty dollars, but from where?"</p><p>The boy said, "That is a secret. You just come with me."</p><p>But the old woman was very, very religious. She said, "Unless you
tell me the truth... have you stolen it? From where did you get these
fifty dollars?" It was Sunday, so she said, "First you come to the
church. If you don't want to tell me, go and confess to the priest. He
will not say anything to anybody, so you just confess the truth."</p><p>The boy said, "Okay."</p><p>He went into the confession box with its small window; on the other
side was the priest. The boy said, "It is very dark here."</p><p>And the priest said, "You son-of-a-bitch, you have started
again."</p><p>Sex has been repressed, but it has not been destroyed. In fact the
people who have repressed it are the people who have perverted the whole
humanity into homosexuality, into lesbianism, into sodomy, into all
kinds of ugliness. Sex naturally is a beautiful phenomenon between two
persons who love each other. And by simply condemning sex you cannot
destroy it, it is existential. But you can poison it, and the whole
humanity is living with that poison.</p><p>I want sex to be a natural, beautiful phenomenon. But that is not my
basic teaching, it is simply a part of accepting the whole of life. But
those sex maniacs who have repressed it, their minds are sick.</p><p>Dr.Â Johnson, one of the great linguists of the English language, has
written a great dictionary, compiling all the English words available at
that time. I am saying this because the English language is the only
language that goes on</p><p>evolving each year -- accepting at least eight thousand new words. It
is not a dead language like Sanskrit or Arabic; it is not afraid, it
goes on growing.</p><p>When the dictionary was published, after a few days, three old
ladies, seventy, seventy-five, and eighty -- very old, with thick
glasses -- came with the dictionary to Dr.Â Johnson and said, "You seem
to be destroying the morality of the country."</p><p>He said, "What have I done?"</p><p>They said, "You have published this sexual book." He said, "Sexual
book? This is a dictionary."</p><p>They said, "Dictionary? There are three words in it which are
obscene." And they had underlined three words in those thousands of
words. Those three old women had done such a great job.</p><p>Dr.Â Johnson said, "You are a miracle. Just within three days.â¦ My
work is to collect words, but amongst thousands of words, how could you
find these three words only? You are not concerned with the whole
dictionary, you were looking for these words. And because of these three
words, the dictionary has become a sex manual."</p><p><br></p><p>Sex is not my teaching. My teaching is to be spontaneous, to be
whole. Of course, sex is a part of life, and a very basic and essential
part of life. It should be given respect. It is sacred, it is not
profane, because you have not created it. You would not have been here
if there was no sex in the world. If your parents had listened to the
so-called mahatmas, you would not have been here at all. There would be
no need of a nuclear world war. Celibacy would have destroyed the world
without any war, silently.</p><p>The people who say that sex is my teaching are simply showing their
mind. And the books you call religious are full of sexuality. Even the
Holy Bible has five hundred pages which can only be called pornographic.
Look into your PURANAS; all are ugly and obscene. But you have become
accustomed, you don't even think twice when you see shivalinga and offer
flowers and pay your respects -- you don't know what you are doing.
Shivalinga is a phallic symbol, and you are worshipping it.</p><p>Just go to Khajuraho and look at your temples. Go to Puri, to
Konarak, and look at your temples. You will be surprised that, "My God,
these are temples?" Thousands of sexual, obscene, ugly statues: love
being made in such strange ways that you may not have ever dreamed. Have
you dreamed of making love to a woman who is standing on her head? In
Khajuraho you can see that. Have you seen three men making love together
to one woman? In Khajuraho you can see that. These are your temples. All
over India you have more statues of Shivalinga than of anything else. It
is strange.</p><p>In India there is only one temple of Brahma, who created the world
according to Hindus. Who bothers about him? -- he has created the world,
his work is finished, he is retired. But then Shiva has to be taken care
of. He is dangerous, he</p><p>is going to destroy the world. It is good to be worshipping him --
staying in his good books, so when he destroys the world at least he can
save you, saying,"This is my poor follower."</p><p>And do you know how this shivalinga came into existence? I would like
to tell you the story.</p><p>Brahma and Vishnu and Shiva are the trimurti, the Hindu trinity, the
three faces of God. Brahma and Vishnu were arguing about something and
they could not come to a conclusion. So they said, "Better we should go
to Shiva and ask his advice, see what he says. With three persons, we
can decide by a majority who is right. With two persons it is very
difficult to agree who is right."</p><p>They went to Shiva; it was early morning. Shiva seems to be very
Western, he was making love to Parvati in the morning. Hindus don't do
that; they do it in the middle of the night, in the silence, without
making any noise. And they do it so quick, so fast, afraid that somebody
may wake up. In the morning this man is making love, and the doors are
open. And these two gentlemen have not even the sense to get out and let
him finish first. They stand there and look, just like every Indian.
They cannot leave such an opportunity.</p><p>Shiva is so much engaged in the exercise of making love that he is
not even aware who is standing there. He goes on doing push-ups! Parvati
tries to stop, because she sees these two fellows standing there, but
Shiva is not a person to be prevented. Six hours pass, he is still
making love, and those two gentlemen are still standing. Because he did
not pay any attention to them, but continued to make love, and they had
other work to do, reluctantly they had to leave such a beautiful
scene.</p><p>And these are your religious books! An Indian board of censors would
not even allow such a scene in a film. It would be censored -- but
Hindus should fight censorship. It is interfering in their religiousness
-- and that is their religion. They should make a film of it which would
be a super-hit. Nothing else, just three hours continuously, Shiva
making love, and those two gentlemen standing, watching from every
corner and every side; no story is needed.</p><p>Angry, because they had to attend to some other business, they cursed
Shiva, "Because you have not paid attention to us, you have not welcomed
us, you have not even seen us, we condemn you, that forever until
eternity you will be remembered by a phallic symbol. Your statues will
not be made." That's really why that shivalinga is worshipped, it is a
curse -- but nobody bothers.</p><p>Sex is not my teaching. My teaching is vast, it comprehends your
whole life. You cannot criticize me because you have sex as part of your
life. I want it to be respected, to be made sacred. If you feel it is
ugly, if you feel it is profane, that means you are born out of
ugliness. Then how can you respect your father? How can you respect your
mother? How can you dare to be respected by your children? Because the
only connection between you and your parents, between you and your
children, is sex. There is no other connection.</p><p>Life has moved from your parents to you, from you to your children.
If you want a respectful society, where parents are loved and respected,
where children are loved and respected, then you will have to respect
the energy of sex too. Otherwise, deep down in your mind your children
are nothing but sin. And you are too because your parents were
committing sin.</p><p>I am against these people who are poisoning life and degrading it
into a sin. I want it to be a beautiful, a virtuous, a sacred
phenomenon. And I am condemned for that around the world.</p><p>Very strange! To say the truth seems to be a crime. But I will go on
committing that crime, because I know those who have condemned me have
not thought of all the implications. They should commit suicide, they
should kill their mothers and their fathers, because they have all
indulged in sex. They should kill their children because they are born
of sex. Do you want this kind of religion to spread on the earth?</p><p>To me, whatever existence has given to you is beautiful. To condemn
me, these people have invented their own ideas, which have nothing to do
with me. They go on teaching to their flocks that I am propounding free
sex. I have never even used the phrase 'free sex'. And what do they
mean? Should sex be sold? It should not be free? Do they want the whole
world to become a world of prostitutes?</p><p>In fact you have made the world a world of prostitutes. A few
prostitutes sell their bodies for one day; you have purchased your wife
for your whole life. And what a strange world -- you have purchased your
wife, and her parents, to get rid of her, have given money to you. And
you have the right to make love to your wife or to your husband whether
they are in the mood or not. I have been a guest in hundreds of houses,
and I was amazed. The husband and wife are continuously quarreling,
fighting, looking like enemies; and they go on producing children.</p><p>To me, a woman not loving her husband and still allowing her body to
be used is functioning as a prostitute. A man not loving his wife but
still making love to her because it is his duty is functioning as a male
prostitute. You will be surprised with the word `male prostitute'. In
the West, within these last twenty years, male prostitutes have appeared
in the market. The women's liberation movement has brought them in. The
woman wants equality in everything, so why should only women be
prostitutes? So now there are, in London, in San Francisco, in Los
Angeles, in New York, male prostitutes also available. A great
liberation of women!</p><p>My effort has been to make human life a love-shrine, a temple of
love. I have been condemned because they don't have any other response.
I have been cutting their very roots.</p><p>But to condemn me about sex is easy, because everybody seems to agree
with them. Even people who are exploiting sex repression by publishing
pornographic magazines like PLAYBOY, PENTHOUSE and other ugly literature
are also against me.</p><p>You can see something very strange. Priests are against me and
pornographers are against me, what does it mean? It means that, if sex
repression disappears, who will be interested in pornography? The whole
business will flop. So there seems to be an inner conspiracy, perhaps
unconscious, between the priest and the pornographer -- that the priest
creates the market and the pornographer reaps the crop. And what a
beauty! The priest goes on condemning pornography, but the more he
condemns it, the more people are looking at ugly, obscene pictures. But
they have to hide them behind The Bible, behind the Gita, so if somebody
suddenly turns up, they can close The Bible and the Gita and you never
know what was hidden in them.</p><p>When I was arrested in America -- when I entered the cell there was
another inmate. On his side he had pasted the whole wall with naked
women, ugly pictures. But every morning, every evening, he would put The
Bible on his bed, kneel down on the floor, put his head on The Bible and
pray for half an hour.</p><p>The first day I watched; the second day I said, "This is strange. You
are a religious person, you should not have these pictures on your
wall."</p><p>He said, "Nobody ever said that to me. All the walls in the jail are
pasted with pornographic pictures, and everybody has a Bible. But I
never saw a contradiction."</p><p>I said, "There is no contradiction. You have repressed sex, that is
written on the wall. And what you do -- putting your head on The Bible,
is simply hypocrisy. By putting your head on The Bible do you think The
Bible will enter into your head, change your being? -- and that is for a
few minutes in the morning, a few minutes in the evening. And
twenty-four hours a day, I see you looking at these pictures, finding
new pictures, bringing new pictures."</p><p>Religions are responsible for pornography, religions are responsible
for sexual perversions. I am simply teaching nature to those whose mind
has been poisoned against nature.</p><h1 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:6pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=the-last-testament-vol-6-chapter-10>The Last Testament, Vol 6

published, as of August 1992. It is for reference use only. The
interviewer's remarks have been omitted where not relevant to Osho's
words]</p><p>INTERVIEW WITH PRESS.</p><p><br></p><p>QUESTION: AFTER YOU LEFT INDIA AND WENT ABROAD, AND WENT THROUGH ALL
YOUR EXPERIENCES, HAS YOUR FAITH IN HUMANITY GONE DOWN?</p><p>ANSWER: I love humanity more than ever. It has grown. But my
conception about the politicians has certainly gone down the drain. They
are the enemies of humanity. The humanity has to be freed from the
chains of politicians and their presence. Going around the world from
one nation to another, I have seen that every nation has been turned
into a concentration camp by the politicians. But as far as humanity is
concerned, my compassion and my love for it has grown deeper.</p><p>Humanity is a victim of power-seekers; of those mad people whose only
ambition in life is their ego. The whole politics is nothing but an ego
game. If we can live without politicians -- and they are not needed at
all -- we can live without the boundaries of nations. Humanity is one.
We can live as one world. Of course functional management will be needed
but governments are not needed. And by functional management I mean like
the management of the post offices, railways. You don't even know who is
the chief of your post offices. There is no need. He is a functional
servant.</p><p>The politicians are continuously wasting time of humanity for their
own interests. The parliaments of the world are doing nothing. They are
gossiping clubs with great fanfare. The presidents and prime ministers
have nothing to do but inaugurate stupid things -- bridges, roads --
this kind of thing can be done by anybody. I am an anarchist. I want to
see humanity without being governed by anybody, because each government
basically means slavery. Education should be such that each person is
capable of being responsible for his own actions. Responsible for order,
responsible for others with whom he lives. There is no need of any
government.</p><p>I am reminded of an old president. He was sick and his friends and
his family was consistently persuading him for an holiday, but he will
not go for an holiday. They could not understand his resistance. They
said, "You are sick, you</p><p>need rest in the hills, in a better climate, unburdened, with all
your political rubbish." The president said, "You do not understand. If
I am away for three or four weeks, the whole country will understand I
am not needed. I am not here to serve the country but to keep the
impression that without me the country will fall apart. But if the
country can see that for four weeks, that old guy has been in the
mountains and the country is running far more beautifully, I will look
useless, futile."</p><p>I do not have any respect for any politician in the world. I have
much more respect for beggars on the street. They are the real
humanity.</p><p>When you talked of politicians and political leaders, could this also
apply to religion and religious leaders? In our own country we see that
it is because of religion that there is so much strife in so many
places. And this has been seen elsewhere also.</p><p>What you have been told is religion is nothing but politics in
disguise. A religious person is not a leader. Because the basic
experience of a religious person is that religion is an individual
affair. A love affair with existence. It does not need any leaders. Do
you need a leader when you fall in love? If you need then, you are in an
urgent state of psychiatric help. Religion is love with existence. There
is no need of Hinduism, and their shankaracharyas. This is another kind
of hierarchy, bureaucracy, another way of dominating man, enslaving
humanity. There is no need of any pope, any church. But you will be
surprised, a few days before, the pope declared that any Catholic
Christian, confessing to God directly is committing a sin. He should
confess to the priest. The priest is the mediator. And he is in direct
contact with God. Do you see the politics? Even with God you cannot
relate directly.</p><p>Perhaps some day the painters will start saying to you, you cannot
see the sunset directly. It is a sin. You should have a mediator. All
religions are a very deep programming for enslaving human spirituality.
The politician tries to dominate your body and the religious leader
tries to dominate your soul. Nothing is left for you. There has been a
conspiracy since the very beginning between the politician and the
priest. These are the greatest criminals in the world. And sooner we get
rid of them, the better. There is no need to be a Hindu, or a Mohammedan
or a Christian, or a Buddhist. To be silent, to be peaceful, to be full
of love and compassion needs no adjective to it. Because compassion is
compassion only. It is not Christian. It is not Hindu. And to be silent
you don't need your scriptures. In fact they are not allowing you to be
silent. They go on pouring crap in your mind. What is the need of
temples and mosques and gurudwaras and churches and synagogues? The
whole existence is the temple of the divine. Wherever you are, if you
are in a state of prayer you are in the temple. All these temples and
churches are businesses.</p><p>I have heard... In a small school, a Christian school, the woman
teacher was hammering the fact into the small boys and girls that Jesus
Christ is the greatest man in the whole history of man. After one hour
she asked whether the message</p><p>has reached. One boy raised his hand. She asked "Who is the greatest
man in the history of man?" The boy said "Abraham Lincoln." He was an
American. The woman was shocked. Another hand raised, she asked "Who was
the greatest man on the earth?" And the girl said, "Gautam Buddha." She
was a Chinese.</p><p>The teacher was getting mad. The whole hour wasted and these idiots
are still clinging to their own ideas. Then a little boy, a Jew, raised
his hand. She could not believe that he will say Jesus Christ, because
Jews crucified Jesus Christ as a criminal. But he had to be given a
chance to answer. She asked him "Who is the greatest man in the world?"
The little Jew said "Jesus Christ, of course." The woman was even more
shocked. She could not believe what was happening. After the class she
got hold of the little boy and said, "You are real cute. But please tell
me, because I know perfectly well you are a Jew. Do you really believe
that Jesus Christ is the greatest man on the earth?" The boy said, "You
know, I know, everybody knows, that Moses is the greatest man who has
been on the earth." The woman said, "Then why you said Jesus Christ?" He
said, "Business is business!"</p><p>"Religion is a totally different affair. In the heart of my hearts I
know who is the greatest man in the history. But you were going to give
the trophy for the right answer. I got the trophy, you got the right
answer and it makes no difference to my inner heart. I know who is the
greatest man. But one has to look after business too."</p><p>All religions are simply nothing but businesses, and the most
dangerous businesses, because they are exploiting your soul, your
integrity, your individuality, your freedom, everything of value. They
support the politicians. The politicians support them -- that's the
conspiracy. Adolf Hitler was blessed by the archbishop of Germany that
you will be victorious, it is God's intention, and I will pray for you,
and the Archbishop of England -- and both are Christians. He was praying
that Winston Churchill wins -- that it is the God's will that England
will rule over the whole world -- and nobody asked that you are putting
God into a trouble. Both represent the same God. And both are praying
for enemies, and their victories. This goes on without the wider world
understanding a simple fact, that religion has nothing to do with any
nations victory. Its work should be the self-realization of man; but no
religion bothers about self- realization. Because a self-realized man
will be able to see the conspiracy, the business, the power-struggle.
All the religions are fighting, for thousands of years. Strange... they
all teach love and they all simply kill. Thousands of living people have
been burned alive in the name of God.</p><p>Politics and religion are the two most ugliest developments, the
greatest diseases that have happened to poor humanity. I would like you
to be your own government -- conscious, alert -- so there is no need of
any government. And I would like you to be your own self, in immediate
and direct contact with existence. So there is no need of any pope, any
shankaracharya, any imam. If these two businesses -- which are almost
like cancer growths -- can be destroyed,</p><p>humanity can be saved. And if they cannot be destroyed, then they are
going to destroy humanity.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHAT YOU TEACH OR PREACH... WHAT IS THAT? IS THAT A RELIGION OR
WHAT IS THAT, AND WHAT ARE YOU... ARE YOU A RELIGIOUS LEADER OR
PHILOSOPHICAL LEADER?</p><p><br></p><p>A: First thing... I am not a leader. That is a four-letter ugly
word... obscene. I am simply a friend. Whatever I have experienced I
want to share it. I don't want anybody to imitate me. I don't give any
ten commandments to people that you have to do this, and you have not to
do this. I simply share my blissfulness, my silence... and leave it to
the people. If they feel to be silent, that is their business. They are
not following me, they are following their own intelligence. My appeal
is not an order. My appeal is to provoke your intelligence and then you
have to follow your intelligence.</p><p>Secondly, I am a religious person, but I do not belong to any
religion. To be a religious person is a beautiful phenomenon and to
belong to any religion is to belong to a crowd of slaves. There are
crowds of Hindus. Belonging to the crowd simply means you are losing
your individuality. And you will be doing stupid things. Do you know in
Hindu religious rituals they drink "Panchamrit." And what is
"Panchamrit?" Cow dung, the urine of the cow, milk, curd, ghee...
everything that comes out of the cow is mixed and it becomes nectar.
Panchamrit. Only idiots can call cow dung, nectar. Except Morarji Desai.
Because he has fallen even below the idiots. He drinks his own
Panchamrit. All religions of the world do stupid things. But because of
the crowd, and the tradition, you repress your individual intelligence.
You can see this is stupid, but you cannot allow your intelligence
because that will make you a rebel, and no religion tolerates rebellious
people.</p><p>I am just a religious person. To me the word 'religious' means my own
experience. My own experience of an eternal being within me which proves
to me the eternal being -- of you, of everybody, of the whole existence.
My religiousness is a thankfulness to existence because it has given so
much, so much love, so much joy, so much blissfulness, so much ecstasy,
that we have nothing to repay it, except gratitude. I don't have any
God, because that brings again slavery. Freedom is my God.</p><p>All the religions have holy scriptures, written by God and they are
so full of nonsense, that if they are really written by God, he should
have committed suicide long before, just out of being ashamed. I don't
have any holy scripture, I don't have a teaching. I have only a sharing.
The distinction is very delicate and fine. Teaching becomes dogmatic,
solid, creates an imprisonment around you. And you are expected to
believe in it. I am against all belief. I am against all faith. Because
only blind people believe that there is light. Those who have eyes don't
believe in light. They know it. Knowing is an experience, not a belief.
I simply</p><p>share my experience with those who are ready to get rid of all kinds
of bondages and who are ready to become themselves... not according to
me, but according to their own potential. Existence never repeats
itself, that's why it never creates another Gautam Buddha, another Jesus
Christ, another Krishna. Existence is infinitely creative. Leader wants
you to follow him. The teacher wants you to live according to his
teachings. These are subtle, psychological exploitations. I am a little
bit strange man. I do not want you to follow me. I have never followed
anybody. I have simply discovered myself. And I would like everybody in
the world to discover himself. And everybody is so unique that if he
follows somebody else he will be only an imitator. He will never know
his own essential being. If he follows somebody else's teaching, he will
remain blind. His beliefs will keep him tethered to the chains given by
somebody else. I have my friends, not followers and I want them to
become themselves. They will be unique, and this is the greatest
opportunity nature has given to you... to be yourself. Not to be anybody
else. This is the respect existence has paid to you. Fulfill it. Don't
become a hypocrite. Become an authentic, sincere being. Let your own
potential blossom. Somebody will may blossom into a rose, somebody in a
marigold, somebody in a lotus. And if every man achieves his
potentiality, this world will become so beautiful, so valuable. It will
not be a crowd. There will not be any crowd at all. There will be only
unique individuals. If you do not do this, you are betraying existence,
and betraying your own self. That is the only sin I know of. To betray
yourself.</p><p>Q: IF THIS IS SO, WHY DO YOU CALL YOURSELF "BHAGWAN?" WHY DO YOUR
FRIENDS CALL YOU "BHAGWAN?" OR EVEN "ACHARYA," WHICH MEANS A
TEACHER?</p><p><br></p><p>A: There are people who call me the devil. There are people who call
me the anti- christ, there are people who call me the satan. I cannot
prevent them. It is their freedom, what they want to call me. There are
people who love me and call me Bhagwan, but Bhagwan does not mean God.
We have called Gautam Buddha, Bhagwan, who has absolutely denied the
existence of God. We have called Mahavir, Bhagwan, who does not believe
in God. Bhagwan must have some other meaning too. And the meaning is
'the blessed one', the one who has arrived. And I say to you, I have
arrived. I am the blessed one, and I would like you also to be the
blessed one.</p><p>But the world is big and I cannot go after everybody, telling them
what to call me. And I cannot prevent anybody calling me anything. As
far as I am concerned, I don't have any name. Neither you have any name.
We are born without any names, but just for utilitarian purposes, names
are needed. They are not our reality. We are nameless existence. The
rose does not know that its name is rose. You have given it a name. But
whether you give it a name or not, a rose is a rose is a rose. So it is
your freedom... whatever you want to call me, you can</p><p>call me. But I don't have any name. I have the state of blessedness;
which is the meaning of Bhagwan. So I don't have any objection against
it.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WHICH COUNTRY DO YOU LIKE BEST, AND WHICH WORST AND WHERE DOES
INDIA STAND IN THIS?</p><p>A: I hate the boundaries which make countries. I love the whole
earth. It is all the same humanity. The colors may be different, the
languages may be different, but the inner reality is the same. I love
the whole earth, and I do not believe in countries.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: COULD YOU TELL US SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR HEALTH, YOUR BACK TROUBLE
AND ALL. IS IT BECAUSE OF THE TREATMENT YOU GOT IN AMERICA IN THE
PRESENT?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No, my health is perfectly good, and in American prisons they were
very much afraid that if something happens to me, they will be condemned
throughout the world. In the first prison, the jailer came to me on the
second day and he said, "In the jail, you are the most secure person,
because the whole eyes of the world, news media, millions of people
continuously phoning -- we had to arrange new phones, and thousands of
flowers are coming, and instructions are being given to us that nothing
happens. If any problem arises to you, we will be condemned for it." And
whenever they changed the jails, because in twelve days I had the great
opportunity of visiting five jails, each jailer giving my charge to the
other jailer whispered in his ears that "Take care. This man is an
intellectual, loved by millions of people around the world. Nothing
should happen to him. Otherwise we are condemned."</p><p>They never touched my body. It was difficult for them to make
arrangements for my food because I must have been their first vegetarian
prisoner, but they took every effort to make me comfortable. I have
nothing to say against the prisons, the jailers, the staff. And every
jail had put me in the hospital ward, so more care can be taken. The
doctor was seeing me every day, twice -- the nurses were attending me, I
was enjoying the journey. Those twelve days were beautiful. My health
has not suffered and when I came out of jail, the first thing the jailer
said to me, "You are the first man who is looking better." Because
people when they come to jail look better, when they go out, they look
like ruins. "When you had come, you were looking better, but now you are
looking perfect. What is the secret?"</p><p>I said, "My secret is, from the outside America was afraid that if
anything even by chance happens to me they will be responsible, because
they had arrested me without any arrest warrant. They had arrested me
without showing me any cause. They had arrested me and did not allow me
to contact my attorneys. So they were in a very confused state. They
knew I had not committed any crime,</p><p>and if something happens to me, their whole image of being a
democracy will be spoiled. And secondly, I had never been so absolutely
alone for twenty-four hours and there was nothing else just to be within
myself. So those twelve days were a continuous meditation. Those twelve
days were for others, that I am jailed</p><p>-- for me those twelve days were of immense freedom, because I was in
Samadhi. I used the opportunity. And this is one of my messages -- Make
the best out of the worst.</p><p>Q: BUT AS YOU SAID, FOR THE OUTSIDERS IT SEEMED YOU WERE IN JAIL AND
I AM SURE SOME OF YOUR FOLLOWERS, AND ALL PEOPLE OVER HERE, WERE UPSET
WHEN THEY SAW YOU IN CHAINS IN PHOTOGRAPHS. THAT WAS NOT KEEPING YOU AND
TREATING YOU WITH DIGNITY.</p><p><br></p><p>A: Handcuffs on my hands, chains on my feet don't touch me. For the
first time what I have been saying my whole life became a reality. That
what happens to the body, does not happen to you. It was a new
experience, and I am always an explorer. Any new experience, even if for
it I am to go to hell, I am ready. Because nothing can touch my inner
being. It is beyond what happens to the body. Even if they had killed
me, I would have died as peacefully, as joyously as any Gautam Buddha.
And it was not my own experience, it was felt by the jail authorities.
When I left the jail, the old jailers eyes were full of tears. He said,
"I have had in my life thousands of prisoners, and I may have many more
in the coming years, but we will miss you. You were totally different. I
don't really want you to leave the jail, because tomorrow morning, when
I will see your cell empty, it will hurt."</p><p>"I have never felt," he said, "for anybody. I have always felt that
it is good somebody is freed. But as far as you are concerned, I would
love that you remain here. Make this jail your commune."</p><p><br></p><p>Q: SO WHAT WOULD YOU MAKE YOUR COMMUNE NEXT, COULD YOU TELL US THAT?
WHAT PLACE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No, I am not going to make any commune myself. My sannyasins are
mature enough now, and I have given them the taste what a commune can
be, and already many communes are springing up. In different parts of
the world there are many communes already. Thousands of sannyasins are
living together. Now my strategy of work is going to be totally
different. Sannyasins have to create the commune, take the
responsibility. I will be visiting as a guest, because now I consider
the whole earth my commune, and I will be going continuously around the
earth. And whenever I will feel tired, then I will be here in Bombay.
Suresh Prakash here is my jailer.</p><p>Q: WOULD YOU BE GOING TO POONA ALSO? THAT IS AFTER ALL YOUR FIRST
MAJOR COMMUNE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: No.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: I CAN SAY YOU ARE NOT GOING TO POONA?</p><p><br></p><p>A: I am not going to Poona because sannyasins from Poona can come
here very easily. There is no point for me to go. And the people of
Poona are so orthodox, so prejudiced, so fanatic. It was not a
coincidence that it was a man from Poona who assassinated Mahatma
Gandhi. Only Poona was capable to do that. Poona tried to assassinate me
too. I am not going to Poona. It is a dead city. Only corpses are
moving. Hindu corpses. My people are there, they can come here. I am so
close. If they want to meet me together I can go to Kandala, to
Lonavala, to anywhere, but not to Poona!</p><p><br></p><p>Q: WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN CURIOUS ABOUT THESE ROLLS ROYCES OF YOURS. I
MEAN SO MUCH HAS BEEN WRITTEN INCLUDING BY MYSELF ABOUT THEM. SO I WOULD
LIKE TO KNOW THE POINT BEHIND IT, SO MANY ROLLS ROYCES?</p><p>A: In fact I don't have even a Honda! I am hoping some friend will
present me a Honda. Those ninety-three Rolls Royces were presented by
different friends from different parts of the world. But because I don't
possess anything, they were given to the commune. I have not taken a
single Rolls Royce from there. I have never seen all those ninety-three
Rolls Royces together. Only for half an hour when I was going to the
meetings, coming back to my home, they provided me a Rolls Royce. Now
sitting inside it does not matter what color the car has -- it may
matter to other people -- they may be giving me every day the same Rolls
Royce, I don't know. But the question arises in many peoples' mind and
it has a great implication. You are not interested in my realization,
you are not interested in the eternity of the soul, you are not
interested in the art of love, you are interested in Rolls Royces. That
shows the poverty of the people and their minds. And that also shows
their ambition.</p><p>Just before I left America, one bishop was continuously preaching to
his congregation against my Rolls Royces. And before I was leaving, I
received a letter from the same bishop, that now Bhagwan, you are going
back, at least you can donate one Rolls Royce to my church. Poverty of
the mind, ambition of the mind, jealousy of the mind is hiding behind
that question. It is not your question, it is the question of all poor
people, ambitious people, who are carrying that in their mind. They
would have loved to see me naked, standing in the snow and then they
would have worshiped me.</p><p>The whole world is against me because they are jealous of me --
because I live comfortably and I want the whole world to live
comfortably -- that is part of my mission to make it clear that poverty
is not religion, that if we can make the whole world luxurious there
will be thousands of Gautam Buddhas blossoming, because when you have
everything, then the only search left is for your own self. Just my
mother has come yesterday and she told me about a Digamber Jaina monk in
Sagar in Madhya Pradesh. Jainism is the only religion that allows a
certain kind of suicide, as spirituality. It calls it `santara.' One
Jaina monk in Sagar is giving `santara' to people. This is something
new. In the past people have taken `santara' but it is a long journey.
You have to stop eating -- it takes almost ninety days for a person to
die. And this Jaina monk is Sagar has found a more contemporary method
-- `santara' can be accomplished in eight days, and many idiots are
reaching to him, asking for `santara.' The government is worried with
me. Their spies are all around the house. The parliaments are discussing
about me and nobody is worried about this man who is really helping
people to commit suicide. What he is doing, he puts the man in a small
room, naked, reduces his food, within two days fast -- he cuts half the
food first day, by the second day the whole food is gone; then he starts
cutting water -- within two days water is gone. After the fourth day, he
had to put four wrestlers around the man because he wants to escape. He
realizes what is happening. He is thirsty, he is hungry -- each part of
his body is crying for food, his mind is going mad. He starts shouting
that I don't want `santara' but it is too late. The Jainas have made
around the temple where the great monk is staying -- they sing loudly,
they make musical instruments, play loudly, so nobody can hear what that
man is saying inside. And his clothes have been taken so he cannot come
out. And those four wrestlers are there, putting him down in his bed,
not allowing him to escape. Within eight days the man is dead. Those
four days, the last days, are sheer agony. This is butchery. This is not
`santara.' But because of this, that Jaina monk is becoming famous and
more and more idiots are coming, because after</p><p>`santara' you go directly to `moksha.' To the ultimate goal of
existence. Whether you want to go or not, is not the question. Once you
have expressed the desire, he manages to send to send you to moksha.
Those four wrestlers are continuously holding him inside so he does not
run out naked and shout that "I don't want to die, I don't want any
moksha. Just let me go my home." They allow the doors to be opened only
when he is dead. Then a great procession -- and his body is not burned
on ordinary wood. It is burned on sandalwood, because he has achieved
the ultimate.</p><p>Now this man is a murderer. And he has murdered few people, and he is
going to murder; and the whole government is silent, because it doesn't
matter to them. In fact, perhaps the president and the prime ministers
will go and pay their respects to the murderer because he has discovered
a short-cut to `santara.' I am not in favor of committing suicide,
slowly or fast. And I am not in favor of poverty. I want humanity to be
rich, outwardly, and also inwardly. And I don't</p><p>see there is any contradiction. The inward and the outward are just
like two wings. They both can help each other.</p><p>But I have never possessed any Rolls Royce. They were possessed by
the commune. Now it was their love, their gratitude, that they never
wanted those cars to be used by others. And there was no need, because
the commune had five hundred other cars, one hundred buses, five
airplanes. I had asked the commune that there is no need for
ninety-three Rolls Royces, the same model, just the colors are
different. You can keep one or two cars for me, and you can use. But no
sannyasin was ready to use. They said, "We have enough cars, enough
busses, enough airplanes, and nowhere to go." Nobody liked to go out of
commune. And the commune was in a desert of one hundred twenty-six
square miles. The closest American town was twenty miles away, and
nobody wanted to go anywhere, because we were living in an oasis --
starting in meditation in the morning, then listening to me, then going
to work as a joy. Five thousand people eating together was something to
be seen. And when there was world festival there were twenty thousand
people eating together, under one roof. And somebody was playing on the
guitar. And somebody was dancing. And after the sunset when the work
time was over, people have taken their supper, they will dance in the
streets till the middle of the night, sing songs of beauty and love. It
was such a rejoicing, that nobody wanted to go out. Finally we had to
sell those five hundred cars, because nobody was using them. We had to
sell four aeroplanes, because nobody was using them. We had created a
dream into a reality, and it was so sweet, so unbelievable that nobody
wanted to miss a single moment. But I had given those cars to the
commune. Thousands of other presents had come to me. They were all given
to the commune. I don't possess anything, except the commune. I don't
possess anything, except myself. That is my only possession and my only
paradise.</p><p>Any other question?</p><p><br></p><p>Q: NO, THANK YOU, THAT'S ENOUGH.</p><h1 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:6pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=the-last-testament-vol-6-chapter-12>The Last Testament, Vol 6

India</h1><p><br></p><p>[NOTE: This discourse will be in the book "India Coming Back Home",
which has not been published, as of August 1992.]</p><p>INTERVIEW BY SOCIETY</p><p><br></p><p>WOMEN ALL OVER THE WORLD FIND YOU EXTREMELY ATTRACTIVE; ACCORDING TO
YOUR CRITICS, FATALLY SO. HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOUR OWN SEX
APPEAL?</p><p><br></p><p>The whole history of man is a history of condemnation of women by all
the societies, by all the cultures, by all the religions. Among even the
greatest human beings who have walked on the earth there is not a single
one who has respected women. Moses, Jesus, Mohammed, Mahavira, even
Buddha, have condemned women in some way or other. I am the first man
who has given womankind the same respect as is given to man. It has
nothing to do with sex appeal.</p><p>In the Jewish synagogues, women cannot sit with men, there is a
curtain they have to sit behind. They are not considered equal even
spiritually. When Indira Gandhi visited Israel, another woman was prime
minister of Israel. Indira wanted to visit a synagogue. The Jewish woman
prime minister was worried because the separation is so insulting. She
made a special arrangement that both prime ministers would sit on the
balcony so no men could see them, and Indira would not become aware that
women are treated in such a humiliating way. Indira was not aware of the
tradition. She said to the prime minister of Israel, "This is something
great. Do prime ministers in your country have a special place on the
balcony in every synagogue? Even a visiting prime minister?" And it is
said the Jewish prime minister simply smiled and didn't answer because
the reality was totally different -- it was not respect, it was an
insulting situation. To avoid it, she had created this facade.</p><p>Jesus' best followers were women, but none of them were accepted by
him and his church as his apostles. The twelve apostles are all men, and
when he was crucified all these twelve apostles escaped. They proved to
be simply cowards, fearing that if they were caught, the same would be
their fate. But the three women... Mary Magdalene was once a prostitute,
but when she saw Jesus she fell in love with him and his teachings and
stopped being a prostitute. She was there standing near the cross. That
prostitute humiliated all those twelve apostles.</p><p>Jesus' mother, Mary, was also standing near the cross. Jesus never
respected even his mother because she was a woman. Once he was speaking
to a crowd and</p><p>somebody from the outside shouted, "Jesus, your mother is standing
here. She wants to see you, she has not seen you for three years."</p><p>And the way Jesus responded is so ugly, inconceivable, that it
degrades his whole teaching. He said, "Tell that woman..." He could not
even use the word mother "Tell that woman that I am not her son. My
father is in heaven, and I am his only begotten son."</p><p>This was absolutely out of context -- that poor old woman simply
wanted to see him. There was no need to say this. To say, "Tell that
woman..." shows his attitude about womankind.</p><p>Mohammed had no respect for any women. He allowed each Mohammedan to
marry more women than any other religion has allowed, four women at
least. He himself married nine women. His followers have treated women
like cattle. The Nizam of Hyderabad had five hundred wives, even in this
century.</p><p>Parasuram, the Hindu incarnation of God, was ordered by his father to
kill his mother and bring her head to prove that he had killed her,
because the father suspected that she loved some other man. And
Parasuram did not hesitate.</p><p>A man can never be certain who his father is. The father also cannot
be certain that his children are really his, only the mother knows. But
he followed the order of his father, a father who already suspected that
his wife loved somebody else. There is a possibility Parasuram was not
the son of this man. But to cut the head of a woman was not a problem.
Still, Parasuram remains one of the incarnations of Hindus.</p><p>Krishna surpassed all the Nizams and all the Mohammedans. He had one
wife that he had married, and sixteen thousand wives stolen from other
people. Whenever he saw any beautiful woman it was enough, she was taken
to his palace. No man has done such criminality as Krishna, but he is
worshipped.</p><p>Mahavira, the most important prophet of Jainism, teaches that a woman
cannot be released from the body and the world. First, she has to be
born again as a man and only then she can attain to moksha, but not
directly from the body of a woman. And these people have been saying
consistently, insistently, that the soul is neither male nor female,
that the body remains behind, only the soul moves, so why should a
distinction be made -- that the soul of a man can reach to the highest
peak of consciousness but the woman's soul cannot?</p><p>Gautam Buddha did not allow any woman to be initiated into his
sannyas for twenty years. Thousands of women cried, wept, but this man,
who is thought to be the most compassionate man in the world, went on
denying them. He would not accept any woman as a disciple for twenty
years.</p><p>It was just by coincidence that he finally had to accept a woman. The
day he was born his mother died. His mother's sister did not get
married, just so she could take care of this boy. No mother has loved
any boy the way this woman loved, the way this woman sacrificed.</p><p>In her old age she came and asked to be initiated. There was immense
silence over the ten thousand sannyasins of Gautam Buddha and he himself
was in a</p><p>dilemma. This woman has sacrificed her whole life for him and to say
'no' did not feel right to him. Unwillingly, he initiated her, but the
condemnation was so deep that in his initiation speech he said, "My
religion was going to last for five thousand years, but now that I have
initiated a woman into the commune of my sannyasins, my religion will
last only five hundred years."</p><p>Do you see the point? He is throwing the responsibility on a poor old
woman for destroying his religion. From five thousand to five hundred
means four thousand five hundred years are sacrificed because one woman
has been initiated. Can you condemn somebody more?</p><p>Women are attracted towards me. It is not a sex appeal; it is a
spiritual appeal, because I am the first man who has not made any
distinction between man and woman as far as spiritual growth is
concerned.</p><p>Women are fighting all over the world, particularly in the advanced
countries, for ordinary liberation from man. I have given them the
ultimate liberation, the equality of consciousness. And if they are in
love with me it has nothing to do with sex. It has something to do with
superconsciousness.</p><p>I HAVE HEARD FROM RATHER RELIABLE SOURCES THAT IN 1969, WHEN THE LATE
INDIRA GANDHI WAS OF TWO MINDS ABOUT MORARJI DESAI, YOU ADVISED HER TO
SACK HIM FROM THE CABINET AND SHE DID SO EVENTUALLY. IS THIS THE REASON
BEHIND HIS ANIMOSITY TOWARDS YOU?</p><p>It is true. She had discussed with me whether to remove Morarji Desai
from the cabinet or not, and I said to her, "It is not a question of
Morarji Desai. If anyone is against the evolving nation, if he is a
blocking stone in the progress of the country, then whoever he is, he
should be removed immediately -- there should not be two minds about
it."</p><p>Morarji Desai's animosity toward me is not solely dependent on this
fact -- it had already begun ten years before. Twenty people from all
over the country were invited by Acharya Tulsi to address a gathering;
they were celebrating a great festival. The gathering was big, nearabout
one hundred thousand people.</p><p>I was one of those twenty people and Morarji Desai was also. Morarji
Desai was then the finance minister. An incident happened that started
his animosity, then many things got added to it. From my side there is
no animosity against him.</p><p>The incident was that these twenty invited guests were sitting on the
floor and Acharya Tulsi, the host, was sitting on a higher stage; nobody
had bothered about it. Morarji, just like a political leader, arrived
last.</p><p>The twenty people were gathered to first discuss human problems
before they addressed the one hundred thousand people who were waiting
outside. But Morarji said as he entered, "Before any other question is
raised I have to ask two questions. First, when I entered I folded my
hands the way in India we greet</p><p>each other, but Acharya Tulsi did not respond with folded hands.
Rather, he raised one of his hands to give a blessing."</p><p>That was very insulting to him, although Acharya Tulsi was simply
following a Jaina tradition -- that only the monk can bless you because
he is higher than you. He has renounced the world, you have not
renounced the world. You can bow down with folded hands, you can touch
his feet, but that does not mean that he will respond in the same
manner. The tradition is ugly, because to me, the higher person should
be more humble.</p><p>And he said, "The second question is: why are the guests sitting on
the floor and you, the host, are sitting on a higher stage? First,
answer these two questions and then we can discuss other things."</p><p>Acharya Tulsi himself is not a religious man. He wears religious garb
but he has a very political mind. He was in a fix what to do, how to
answer; he did not want to annoy Morarji Desai. There was silence for a
few seconds, then I said -- Morarji Desai was sitting by my side -- I
said, "The question has not been asked to me so I have to ask the
permission of both the parties. Acharya Tulsi has been asked but he
seems to have no answer. If he allows me to answer I can answer, but I
want Morarji Desai to give me permission, because he has not asked
me."</p><p>He said, "It does not matter from whom the answer comes. I want the
answer."</p><p>I said, "Now things can be sorted out. One thing: there are twenty
guests, nineteen guests have passed through the same process, and nobody
raised the question. You seem to be a very egoistic person, hence the
question has arisen in your mind. Otherwise, what does it matter? He is
sitting on a high stage, he can hang himself from the ceiling, still he
will not be the highest. There are spiders moving on the ceiling, you
can see them. If to be higher is to be greater, then those spiders are
the greatest here.</p><p>"Secondly, when you greet someone with your folded hands you are
showing your heart. It cannot be conditional, it cannot be that the
other should respond in the same way. Otherwise, you should first make
the condition that, `I will fold my hands and bow down to you if you are
also ready to do it to me.' It was your fault -- you did not make the
condition.</p><p>"As far as Acharya Tulsi is concerned he has proved himself simply
stupid. There was no need to answer the questions, he could have just
come down from his stage and sat with us on the floor. There was no need
to use a single word, his action would have been an answer. But he is
sitting there almost like he is dead. He cannot move, he cannot step
down from the stage, he cannot fold his hands to receive you. These two
egoists are facing each other and destroying the whole conference. You
both can keep quiet, the remaining eighteen people can continue the
discussion."</p><p>That was the beginning of the animosity from Morarji Desai and
Acharya Tulsi. To say the truth in this world is to create enemies. But
from my side I don't feel any animosity, I simply feel sad for these
people, they are retarded -- they don't have any intelligence to
understand simple things.</p><p>THE HEAD OF THE INTERNATIONAL KRISHNA CONSCIOUSNESS MOVEMENT SAID
RECENTLY, REFERRING TO YOU, "THE BIRDS AND BEES HAVE SEX, EVEN INSECTS
HAVE IT. WHY DO YOU NEED A GODMAN TO TEACH YOU THAT?"</p><p>PLEASE COMMENT.</p><p><br></p><p>The head of the Krishna Consciousness Movement is an American
idiot.</p><p>He is doing a great job. And referring to me, he said that, "Bees
have sex, birds have sex -- why do you need a godman to teach you
sex?"</p><p>A godman is needed to teach you sex because you belong to the Krishna
Consciousness Movement. You have forgotten what sex is.</p><p>I have heard that when this idiot was passing, two small boys were
discussing the difference between ordinary men and these swamis. One boy
who was a little older said, "Just wait, when you become a little older
you will know."</p><p>The other said, "What? I may not understand, you try to help me."</p><p>He said, "It is a simple difference. These people use their sex organ
only to urinate and others use it for other things also. But you will
have to grow a little, then you will know."</p><p>Teachers are needed to show these people that the sex organ is not
given to you just for urination. Nature has higher hopes!</p><p>SOME WESTERN INTELLECTUALS HAVE HAILED YOU AS A GREAT PSYCHOLOGIST
AND PHILOSOPHER. DO YOU EVER REGRET THE DECISION TO BECOME A GODMAN
INSTEAD OF PURSUING AN ACADEMIC CAREER? AFTER ALL, WHO WOULDN'T WANT TO
BE IN THE COMPANY OF FREUD OR CARL JUNG?</p><p>The question has many questions in it. I will take them one by
one.</p><p>First, the journalists are always playing a vicious game. They
started calling me godman, I have never called myself godman. And then
they ask me, "Why do you call yourself godman?"</p><p>There is no species in the world which can be called godman. Just to
be man is enough -- there is no God. At least I cannot call myself a
'godman', because I don't accept any existence of a god who created the
world.</p><p>Existence has always been here and will always be here. It was never
created. God is a hypothesis to explain something. Because existence is
there, the question arises in every intelligent man's mind, "Who created
it? How did it come into being?" From the time of the RIGVEDAS to today
-- the same question. And when such questions arise in the mind they
become a torture, you have to find some answer. Then the wise people, or
unwise people, start giving you consolations. They say, "God created the
world." But it is strange that you don't ask who created God; the
question remains the same.</p><p>If God can be there without any creator, then why cannot existence be
there without any creator? Why unnecessarily go on adding more
hypotheses -- god A created god B, god B created god C... and you will
not come to an end, you will fall into an infinite regress, and finally
you will find the question is still there as intact as it was before.
The whole journey has been futile. And even if you accept, just
hypothetically, that God created the world, it does not solve anything,
it creates a thousand more questions. Why has he created the world?</p><p>I was going on a journey and I went to my tailor and I told him,
"Make my robe -</p><p>- I have only six days, on the seventh day I will be leaving the
city. In six days you have to make the robe."</p><p>He was a Christian. He said, "If you say, I will make. But just look
around the world. God created the world in six days and what a mess. I
will create the robe in six days, but don't tell me later on that it is
just a mess!"</p><p>And because God created a mess, he has not been found since.</p><p>Either he is hiding or escaping. Physicists say the stars are
escaping farther away with the speed of light. Perhaps he is riding on
some big star and is just running away from the mess he created.</p><p>And why did he create it at a certain moment? What was he doing
before that? Christians say he created the world exactly four thousand
and four years before Jesus Christ was born. I assume it must have been
the first of January. You cannot create in the middle of the year,
because where could you have started the year?</p><p>According to Christians, he created the world only six thousand years
ago. And what had he been doing for the eternity that had passed before?
Just sitting silently, doing nothing? And suddenly, for no reason at all
-- nobody has asked him, nobody has requested him -- seems to be a
little crackpot -- he created the world; and this world where everything
is wrong, howsoever you arrange it.</p><p>I have heard one man was purchasing a toy for his child. It was a toy
which you have to fix. It came in many parts, you have to fix those
parts and then it comes to a certain figure. He fixed it in every
possible way. He was a professor of mathematics, but whatever he did it
was always wrong.</p><p>He was perspiring in the cold. Finally he went to the owner of the
shop and he said, "Something is wrong. This toy I cannot manage. My
whole life I have devoted to mathematics. Whatever you do, it always
turns around."</p><p>The owner started smiling. He said, "It will turn around, whatever
you do." He said, "Well, what kind of toy is this?"</p><p>He said, "This represents the world. And it is better for your
children to learn from the very beginning that whatever you do, it is
going to be wrong! This toy has been created with great genius to teach
children, `Don't be worried. Here, right things don't happen. There is
no way to do things in a right way. All ways lead towards something
which is wrong. You always end up in a mess! This is an educational
toy."</p><p>The hypothesis of God does not help. I don't have any hypothesis of
God. To me life is divine. To me existence is godliness, not God. To use
the word `godman' for me is simply stupid. But journalists started
calling me that, and then started asking me, "Why do you call yourself
godman?"</p><p>Strange! They started calling me the guru of the rich and then they
started asking me, "Why do you call yourself the guru of the rich?" They
started calling me the sex guru, and then they started asking me, "Why
do you call yourself the sex guru?"</p><p>I have never called myself godman. Yes, the people who love me have
called me Bhagwan, but Bhagwan does not mean God. We have called Gautam
Buddha 'Bhagwan' -- and he does not believe in any god. We have called
Mahavira 'Bhagwan' -- and he does not believe in any God.</p><p>So 'Bhagwan' cannot be synonymous with God. 'Bhagwan' simply means
the blessed one, one who has attained the ultimate bliss, the peace, the
joy of his own being. And I say unto you that I am the blessed one, but
I am not the godman. I am simply a man fulfilled.</p><p>Secondly, your question asks, "I was praised by people as a great
psychologist, as a philosopher. Why did I start calling myself a
godman?"</p><p>Half of it I have answered. As for the other half, I am not a
psychologist. A psychologist inquires into the complications of the
mind. I am a meditator who does not bother about the mind but simply
goes beyond it.</p><p>Gautam Buddha is not a psychologist. His achievement is not the
knowledge of the mind, but the experience of no-mind. It is beyond
psychology. I have experienced no-mind.</p><p>I cannot allow anybody to call me a psychologist. I am not. And I do
not think that the people who are psychologists have anything to offer
to a man who has known something beyond mind. I would like you to be
reminded that psychologists commit suicide twice as often as any other
profession, they go mad three times as often as any other profession. I
don't want to belong to such a group of half-mad people.</p><p>You asked, "Would it not have been better to be categorized with
great psychologists like Freud and Jung?"</p><p>No.Â To me, both are sick because both are below the silence of their
own inner being. They are still struggling with empty thoughts, hot air,
nothing. And if you look into their lives, you can see it.</p><p>Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, was so much afraid of
death -- I don't think anybody present here is so much afraid. You
cannot conceive, but even the word 'death' was tabooed, it was not to be
uttered in his presence. Twice it happened that somebody mentioned death
and he fell from his chair into unconsciousness, his mouth foaming.
Sigmund Freud flat on the ground. The great founder of psychoanalysis
had not even enough courage to listen to the word 'death'. I do not want
to be categorized with these people.</p><p>Jung was expelled; in the movement of psychoanalysis he was second
only to Sigmund Freud. Everybody thought that he was going to be his
successor. And he was profoundly intelligent. But he was expelled from
the movement because he was interested in ghosts. Sigmund Freud told
him, "Drop this. I cannot even tolerate those words."</p><p>His interest was in what happens beyond death, so naturally he was
interested in death, in ghosts, and this was the basic reason that he
was thrown out. You would think he was a courageous man but it is not
so. All his interest in ghosts and death and what happens beyond life
was only intellectual. He wanted to go to Egypt to see the old, dead
bodies preserved as mummies. Twelve times he booked and twelve times he
cancelled. His whole life he wanted to go, but when the day came to go,
he would become so afraid of seeing a dead body that was three thousand
years old, he would find some excuse and cancel the ticket.</p><p>He came to India; he went to the universities. He was here for three
months and it was simple stupidity to talk to the psychoanalysts in the
universities because they were taught in the West -- they were parrots.
He had come to try to understand the Eastern psychology. It was
suggested by many people that if you want to understand Eastern
psychology then you are going to the wrong people; if you want to
understand Eastern psychology then there is a man in the South, Raman
Maharshi. Go to that man, who has not even heard the word</p><p>`psychology'.</p><p>He went to Madras and then fear gripped him because he had heard that
these people have hypnotic powers, their eyes are hypnotic, their
gestures are hypnotic, and it is dangerous to go to these people, they
can convert you. You will forget completely for what you had come; they
can put you on a new route. From Madras he came back. Only two hours
more and he would have reached Shri Raman Maharshi -- a simple man with
no bookish knowledge, but of immense self-realization -- a man who has
reached, who has arrived home.</p><p>Certainly he has an aura. In his presence there is a magnetism, but
it is not to mislead you, it is not to misguide you. This is the way of
the East, to find a man who has found himself and to sit at his feet,
just in silence. There is no need to say anything. His silence can start
moving your heart in a new rhythm, with a new music, which you had never
heard before -- a new harmony, a new synchronicity.</p><p>First, it will happen between the disciple and the master, and then
it will start happening with the trees, with the rivers, with the
mountains, with the ocean, with the stars, with existence itself. The
master is only a door. The Sikhs are right to call their temple
Gurudwara. It simply means `the master is a door'.</p><p>And when he reached back home he was asked why he had not met people
who were really rooted in the East. Going to the universities, which are
by-products of the West, was simply a waste of time. However, he started
finding explanations, rationalizations. And his rationalization was, "I
have avoided meeting these</p><p>people because the East has its own way, the West has its own way,
and they are so different, so diametrically different, that it is
dangerous to mix them."</p><p>This was a consolation and a rationalization, but absolutely cunning.
You can teach Eastern people Western ways. He himself, in his institute
in Zurich, was teaching Eastern people Western ways. That was okay, it
was not disturbing anybody. But he could not learn from the East because
that may disturb. If he was really honest, he should have refused
Eastern people the right to study at his institute. He should have told
them, "This is not your way. Go to Shri Raman Maharshi. Don't come
here."</p><p>But no, if people from the East were coming, it was perfectly okay to
condition their minds, to program their minds, to fill their minds with
all kinds of rubbish. But when he came here, he avoided those people who
can help you get rid of all rubbish, who can help you become absolutely
silent and peaceful, in deep harmony with existence.</p><p>I don't see that being in harmony with existence can disturb anybody.
Not a single meditator has ever committed suicide, not a single
meditator has ever gone mad.</p><p>Western psychology has nothing to teach to the East. It has
everything to learn from the East, because it is still working in the
mind. Our whole approach is to transcend mind, don't be bothered with
it, leave it behind. You are bigger than it. Western psychology thinks
mind is all; it is not, it is just the surface. Your innermost reality
is far away from your mind. It is closer to the universal existence. It
is far closer to the farthest star than it is to your own mind. And the
moment you transcend the mind the mind starts stopping on its own,
because you are no more feeding it energy, you are no more giving it
nourishment. It dies its own natural death. The greatest moment in life
is when your mind is transcended, when you know yourself, that you are
more than your mind -- then anxieties, anguish, meaninglessness, all
disappear.</p><p>I am not a psychologist. Psychologists need to learn much and they
can learn only if they understand that there is something more than
psychology in man -- that he has a soul.</p><p>And I am not a philosopher either. It has been one of the most
unfortunate things that the Eastern concept of darshan has been
translated into English as philosophy. Even people like Doctor
Radhakrishnan... but these are all professors, they are not mystics.
They have agreed with this translation -- I disagree. Because philosophy
means `thinking about truth', and one thing that is impossible in the
world is thinking about truth. It is like a blind man thinking about
light. How will he think? And whatever he thinks, is not going to be
even close to the experience of light. Light either can be seen or not
seen, but you cannot think about it.</p><p>You cannot think about love. Either you can love, or you cannot, but
you cannot think about it.</p><p>I am not a philosopher, I am a mystic. I have not thought about
truth, I have seen it. And the strangest thing about truth is that to
see it is to be it. You cannot see it as an object, you can see it only
as yourself. The moment you experience yourself</p><p>-- when the observer and the observed are one, when the seer and the
seen are one, when the experienced and the experiencer are one -- truth
is revealed.</p><p>Western philosophy has been the longest exercise in futility. None of
the Western philosophers -- Plato, Aristotle, Bacon, Kant, Hegel,
Russell -- none of the Western philosophers has had even a glimpse.</p><p>Their whole story is written in PANCHTANTRA which is five thousand
years old. In a village, one elephant comes for the first time and the
village has five blind men. They are excited, more excited than the
people who have eyes, naturally, because those who have eyes can see,
then the excitement is gone. Those five blind people are so excited to
find out what it is that has come.</p><p>They touched the elephant, somebody touched the legs and said, "My
God! The elephant is nothing but a pillar."</p><p>And somebody touched the ears of the elephant and said, "You idiot!
You must be touching some pillar. The elephant is not a pillar, it is
like a big fan which is used by kings." and so on and so forth. All five
were quarreling, and a man who had eyes was watching and laughing.</p><p>The whole Western philosophy is written in that story. All these
blind people are touching and coming to conclusions and quarreling with
each other. And Western philosophy is nothing but argumentation -- not
realization. Hence the Western philosopher will remain just an ordinary
man. He will have great ideas, he will make great systems, but his own
personality, his own individuality, will remain very ordinary. He cannot
become a Gautam Buddha, he cannot become a Lao Tzu, he cannot become a
Chuang Tzu, because these are not philosophers; these are people who
have tried to see within, to reach to the very center of their
being.</p><p>And the center of my being is also the center of every being, it is
the center of the whole universe. Hence if I can know myself I have
known all.</p><p>I do not want to be categorized as a philosopher. It is not my
thinking about truth that I am sharing with my people, it is my
experience that I am sharing. It is not my idea -- it is my taste, it is
my heartbeat. If you want to call me anything you can call me a mystic,
but please drop that ugly word godman.</p><p><br></p><p>UNLIKE THE SPIRITUAL MASTERS OF THE PAST WHO WERE GRIM IN THEIR
SAYINGS AND SELDOM LAUGHED, YOU'VE ALWAYS DISPLAYED A GREAT SENSE OF
HUMOR. PLEASE COMMENT. AND PLEASE CAN YOU TELL ME YOUR FAVORITE
JOKE!</p><p>A sense of humor is my basic contribution to religiousness. All
religious people have been sad and serious and sick. You cannot live
with them. That's why</p><p>people simply touch their feet and run away, because they are so
boring. Just sitting by their side a little while, you will start
feeling bored too.</p><p>I am always thinking that if there is a heaven where these saints and
sages and mahatmas have all reached, then I don't want to go there,
because that will be the saddest place in the whole existence. And
everybody will be trying to be sadder than the other.</p><p>A sense of humor is something especially human. Buffalos don't laugh,
they are all saints. Donkeys don't joke, they are all mahatmas. In their
past lives they have been saints and mahatmas. That's why they have
attained such a great status.</p><p>These are the people who will go to heaven. If after death you are
asked where you want to go, please remember to say, "Wherever you want
to take me, take -- but I don't want to go where saints go!" Even hell
will be better. You will find superior, finer, more juicy people.</p><p>Now the joke. And because it has been asked for by a journalist it is
about three journalists. All three were retired: one was eighty, another
was eighty-five, and the third was ninety. It was their usual habit to
go for an evening walk, sit in a public park and discuss the golden old
days.</p><p>One day it happened that the first journalist, who was eighty,
said,"I feel so ashamed, it hurts. It is like a wound."</p><p>The other two said, "What happened? Who has hurt you?"</p><p>He said, "Nobody has hurt me. Just I was caught red-handed."</p><p>They both said, "You are making a mystery of it. Simply tell us the
whole thing! What happened?"</p><p>He said, "I was caught red-handed by my mother." They said, "At
what?"</p><p>He said, "Now, how to say it? I was peeping through the keyhole when
a beautiful woman was taking a bath and my mother caught me. I feel
ashamed." The two other guys laughed. One said, "Son, don't get
disturbed, it happens to everybody. In childhood everybody looks into
keyholes, into bathrooms, and what else to do? Keyholes are made for
that. Beautiful ladies are made for that. Don't feel ashamed -- we have
all been caught but that doesn't mean that. "</p><p>The man said, "You don't understand at all. You go on saying to me,
"Don't feel ashamed, don't feel ashamed." It is not a question of
childhood! It happened today!"</p><p>Then there was silence. This was too much, if it happened today.</p><p>The second one said, "Yes, we can understand. I will tell you my
story which will give you consolation. It is now the third day that I
have not made love to my wife. She is such a bitch that whenever I
mention love she immediately turns to the other side and says, 'I have a
headache, enough is enough. Now no more.'" The other two laughed now.
The third, the oldest, said, "Do you know his love? First tell what you
mean by love!"</p><p>He said, "It is a very simple process. Every night I take her hand in
my hand and press it three times. By that time I am fast asleep and
snoring. But for three days</p><p>the bitch won't allow me to make love. I can understand you are
feeling ashamed, hurt. I am feeling hurt. My own wife, at this age, is
betraying me!"</p><p>The third man said, "What is happening to me will make you forget all
your troubles. This morning when I started making arrangements to make
love to my wife she said, 'What are you doing?'</p><p>"I said, 'What am I doing? I am just doing what should be done. I am
trying to make love.'</p><p>"My wife said, 'You idiot! This is the fourth time in the night!
Neither you sleep nor you let me sleep! Love, love, love... there is no
limit to it.'</p><p>"I said, 'My God, that means my memory is going. I had completely
forgotten that three times already I have made love.'</p><p>"And you are talking about your troubles. Think of my trouble, my
memory disappearing. At least it is good I can still make the
distinction between day and night."</p><p>So everybody has his problems.</p><p>To look at a problem with humor is human. Except for human beings no
animal can laugh. And your religions have been preventing you from
laughter.</p><p>In the schools they teach the three R's; I teach the three L's...
Life, Love, Laughter.</p><p><br></p><p>The Last Testament, Vol 6 Chapter #12</p><p>Chapter title: None</p><p>12 August 1986 pm in Bombay, India</p><p><br></p><p>Archive code: 8608125 ShortTitle: LAST612 Audio: Yes</p><p>Video: Yes</p><p><br></p><p>[NOTE: This is a typed tape transcript and has not been edited or
published, as of August 1992. It is for reference use only.]</p><p><br></p><p>BELOVED BHAGWAN,</p><p>WHAT DID YOU MEAN WHEN YOU SAID IN THE LETTERS TO AMITABH THAT YOU
HAVE GONE BEYOND ENLIGHTENMENT?</p><p><br></p><p>Existence has no limits. There is no point which is the full point.
Wherever you are, there is still much more to happen to you. The way is
endless. There is no goal and this is the beauty of live, because if
there was an end, a goal, that would</p><p>mean nothing but death. Live is an ongoing affair. It goes on
flowering from eternity to eternity.</p><p>Enlightenment is a tremendous experience, so vast, so mysterious, so
blissful that people who have achieved it, have stopped there. They have
thought that the whole has arrived. I am basically a homeless wanderer.
In the beginning I was also thinking, but the experience is so beautiful
that there cannot be anything more beautiful than this. The experience
is so ecstatic, that it is incomprehensible even to think, to imagine
that there can be more.</p><p>But this is the mystery of live. There is always more. Just out of
curiosity, I started looking beyond enlightenment. And I was surprised
that enlightenment is only a beginning, not the end. Beginning of a
journey of light which goes on expanding, goes on becoming more and more
juicy -- Rasso Viser.</p><p>The Upanishads have called the ultimate experience that it is very
juicy. I am a milestone in the history of man's growth and
consciousness. That's what I mean when I say, "Enlightenment has been
left far behind. I have gone beyond it." And the beyond has no limits.
It is just like the horizon that surrounds you. As you come closer to
it, it moves further back. You never reach, you are always arriving, but
you never arrive.</p><p>This is the meaning of live. Just think that if there was an end to
your search what would be left? What you will do then? Even
enlightenment will become a boredom. Even blissfulness twenty- four
hours every day, every month, every year, every life, for ever and ever
will start collecting dust on it. It will loose the initial glamour, the
initial youth, the initial benediction.</p><p>But up to now, nobody has said, that there is anything beyond
enlightenment. That's why I say, I am a milestone. With me, a new
chapter in the history of consciousness begins. Enlightenment will be
now the beginning, not the end. Beginning of a non-ending process in all
dimensions of richness.</p><p>BELOVED BHAGWAN,</p><p>IN ONE OF YOUR LATEST LETTERS TO THE THERAPISTS HASYA SAID THAT YOU
ABANDONED THE OUTER SANNYAS IN FAVOR OF THE INNER SANNYAS. WOULD YOU
PLEASE SAY MORE ABOUT IT?</p><p><br></p><p>I have been working hard to abandon everything that is outer, so that
only the inner remains for you to explode.</p><p>Otherwise the man's mind is a very immature mind. It starts clinging
with outer symbols. That has happened to all the religions of the world.
They all started well, but they all went astray. And the reason was that
the outer was emphasized so much that people completely forgot the
inner. To fulfill the outer was such life-absorbing task that there was
no space left even to remember about your inward journey which is
basically the meaning of religiousness.</p><p>If you watch the so-called saints, sages, mahatmas, their life, you
will be surprised. They are more outworldly than you are.</p><p>Once I was traveling with a very famous Hindu monk. It was hilarious
to see that his whole life, twenty-four hours, was engaged into
non-essential things. For example, he will not eat anything, he will
only drink the milk of a cow. And people worshiped him just for that
which is not an achievement.</p><p>Every child of every animal is borne doing that. And the milk has not
to be of any other animal except cows. The milk of the buffaloes was not
acceptable. In fact, it is richer. It has more vitality.</p><p>But the Hindu tradition has never called the buffalo even auntie. And
the cow has to be of absolutely white color. I was surprised that this
is something strange. Any other color, particularly black, even patches
of black on the white cow was not acceptable to the saint. He would
rather fast than compromise, so his followers were always carrying four,
five white, absolutely white cows, wherever he was going. Because it is
very difficult to find a completely purely white cow.</p><p>I asked him, "What is the matter? What is wrong with a brown cow, or
with a black cow? Or with a cow with many patches of different
colors?"</p><p>He said, "Whiteness is the symbol of saintliness."</p><p>I said, "My God! The cow has to be saintly for you and even the
blackest cow will give the whitest milk. You should look at the milk not
at the cow. Who is telling you to drink black milk?</p><p>And he was so much suspicious about people and in this country
particularly about milk you cannot be certain. You cannot be certain
about anything. Even about medicines you cannot be certain on which your
life depends. And the doctor may be simply giving you injections of just
colored water.</p><p>Thousands of people have died because there is so much deception in
everything. The label is right, but you cannot decide what is inside.
And about milk everybody knows people are mixing it with water.</p><p>When I was a student, the man who used to bring the milk for the
students in the hostel, everybody was asking him, "Do you mix
water?"</p><p>And he said, "But I can take any oath. And his son used to carry the
bucket of milk with him and he will put his hand on his son's head and
say, "This is my son. And I take the oath that I have never mixed in my
life water into milk."</p><p>One day I called him inside my room. I closed the room. He said,
"What are you doing?"</p><p>I said, "Just a little privacy." And I asked him that "I cannot
believe that the milk that I get is not mixed with water. How do you
manage even to take an oath?" He said, "It is very simple. But don't
tell to anybody. I never mix water into milk. I always mix milk into
water. It is a simple thing. I can take the oath, because I have never
done that. I always mix the milk into water. For that nobody is
asking."</p><p>This Hindu monk was so suspicious that the cow had to be milked in
front of him.</p><p>I said, "What kind of religious progress, what kind of consciousness
you are attaining by all these stupidities? Five cows have to be carried
with you. Then</p><p>you have two stand there when they are being milked. As if your whole
spirituality depends on this stupidity."</p><p>This was just an instance. Twenty-four hours this was his way. No
woman could come closer than nine feet. His disciples were continuously
measuring the distance between the woman who had come to see the saint.
It has to be exactly nine feet.</p><p>I said, "What is this nonsense?"</p><p>He said, "You don't understand. A women has a magnetic force but its
radius is only nine feet."</p><p>I said, "From where you got this idea?"</p><p>He said, "My master. He got this from his own master. It is given in
secrecy whispered from ear to ear, from generation to generation."</p><p>I said, "Strange, can you support it by any scripture?"</p><p>He said, "No, it is a private tradition. Scriptures are public. My
master cannot deceive me."</p><p>Naturally his master cannot deceive him. And nobody knows who was the
idiot who started the idea. Whenever he will go any place, first he will
enquire `Has there been any woman?'</p><p>He could not sit at a place where a woman was sitting until nine
minutes have passed. The same radius. Nine feet it goes, in a space nine
minutes it goes in time. After nine minutes he can sit, but not before
that.</p><p>I said, "You are living a life of phobia. This is not saintliness.
You are living in constant fear. Your whole life, day and night, is
nothing but fear.</p><p>And you have become so much focused on outer things which are
meaningless that I don't see you have any time for the inner." All the
religions have become focused on the outer. I am trying to abandon
everything that is outer. My people have no outer discipline. They have
no outer obsession.</p><p>Their whole effort and energy has to be directed inwards. Life is
small and time is so precious. You cannot waste it into unnecessary
things. And you can see people all around wasting it in unnecessary
things.</p><p>One shankaracharya was staying in Delhi and a poor man, a clerk stood
up in the question hour and asked about the ultimate, what it is, how to
attain it.</p><p>And the shankaracharya looked at him. He was using the ordinary desk,
a full pant, a bush shirt, and he became furious. The shankaracharya
said, "You have some nerve to ask about the ultimate. And you are
wearing a full pant. First answer me. Have you got the yoga pavid*, the
Hindu thread inside your bush shirt?. And when you urinate, do you
urinate standing or sitting?"</p><p>And all the idiots who had gathered there and I don't think anybody
else goes there. They laughed, the poor man said, "In a full pant it is
very difficult to sit and all the urinoirs are made in the offices so
that you can urinate standing."</p><p>He said, "This is against Hindu religion. Have you ever heard any
seers of the Vedas, urinating standing? And what about the thread? Do
you put it on your ear?"</p><p>He said, "In fact, I don't have any thread." He said, "This is too
much. You are go to suffer in hell fire, because while urinating, if you
don't put the thread on your ear, then you are vulnerable to all kinds
of evil influences. That is the moment when devil enters into
people."</p><p>This comes from a shankaracharya who is supposed to be the head of
the Hindu religion. As if religion's concern is urinals, thread and
protecting people from evil. And Hindus have been doing that, but I
don't think that they are protected from evil in any way. They are just
as human as people are anywhere else.</p><p>I want my people to understand it clearly. Neither your clothes, nor
your outer disciplines nor anything that has been given to you by
tradition and you have accepted it just on belief, is going to help. The
only thing that can create a revolution in you is going beyond the mind
into the world of consciousness. Except that, nothing is religious. But
to begin with and with a world which is too much obsessed with outer
things, I had to start sannyas also with outer things. Change your
cloths into orange, wear a Mala, meditate, but the emphasis was only on
meditation.</p><p>But I found that people can change their clothes very easily but they
cannot change their minds. They can wear the Mala, but they cannot move
into their consciousness. And because they are in orange cloths, wearing
a Mala, having a new name, they start believing that they have become a
sannyasin.</p><p>Sannyas is not so cheap. Hence it is time and you are mature enough
that beginning phase is over. If you like the orange color, the red
color, perfectly good</p><p>-- it cannot do any harm, but it is not a help either. If you love
the Mala, if you love the locket with my picture on it, it is simply
your ornament, but it has nothing to do with religion. So now I reduce
religion to its absolute essentiality. And that is meditation. If you
are meditating and if you are reaching higher and higher into your
consciousness, thoughts are left far behind. You experience that your
body is just outside you, your mind is just outside you and you are
standing in the middle, the center of the cyclone, in utter silence, in
absolute beauty, in great light, in utter fulfillment. Except the
process of meditation, everything is non- essential.</p><p>I don't want my people to be lost into non- essentials. In the
beginning it was necessary. Now years of listening to me, understanding
me, you are in a position to be freed from all outer bondage. And you
can for the first time be really a sannyasin only if you are moving
inwards.</p><p>BELOVED BHAGWAN,</p><p>WHAT IS THE FUNCTION AND THE IMPORTANCE OF ALL HEAD- QUARTERS FOR YOU
IN EUROPE? AND HOW WILL IT IMPART YOUR SPIRITUAL GUIDANCE? DOESN'T IT
IMPLY ORGANIZATION AND STRUCTURE AGAIN?</p><p>The world head-quarters has nothing to do with organization,
structure. In fact, to avoid organizations and structures, the world
head-quarters is being created. I receive thousands of letters, it is
impossible for me to answer them all. It is even impossible for me even
to read them all. And I will be a wandering mystic onwards, because no
country has the courage to let me settle there, even my own country
where I was born wants me to fulfill certain conditions.</p><p>I have never fulfilled conditions imposed upon me by anyone. So for
me the only course remains to wander around the earth. And in a way
perhaps this is what existence wants me. Because in this way, I will be
able to reach more people than in any other way. In this way I will be
available to almost every sannyasin around the world than in any other
way.</p><p>They all cannot come to me, they have their financial difficulties,
but those are not important. There are governments all over the world,
every government even if I ask for a three week tourist visa, asks me,
"Are you going to make a commune here?"</p><p>I say, "I had a great respect for human beings always, but listening
to your questions, I feel that I was wrong. In three weeks tourist visa,
how a commune can be created? I will be meeting my sannyasins and few
countries are so much afraid, that even before I have applied for a
tourist visa, their parliaments have decided that I should not be
allowed in the country, because I am a dangerous man. About that they
are right. But even for a dangerous man you cannot prevent a tourist
visa, unless he commits a crime against your constitution, against your
law. I have never been in the country, how I can commit any crime
against that country's law, its order, its constitution. Let me give me
a chance. I will try my best, but first let me have a chance. I have not
even heard the names of countries before, who have decided that I will
not be allowed in their country. I heard only because they decided,
their parliament decided that I should not be allowed. And it seems to
be a world conspiracy, because the same reasoning is been given in every
parliament that the man is dangerous that the man is extremely
intelligent that the man can destroy your youth, its morality. He can
corrupt people by his ideas, destroy the tradition, the religion, he can
create a disorder.</p><p>I was simply amazed, I had never thought that religions and
moralities and churches which have been two-thousand, three-thousand,
four-thousand, five- thousand years old, can be destroyed in a three
week time? They have given me a clue. Now I know where they stand. Their
fear has exposed them.</p><p>But it doesn't matter. If one country stops me, I enter another
country nearby and my sannyasins can come to meet me there.</p><p>But now this is going to be my way of work that rather sannyasins
coming to me, I will be going to them and knocking on their doors.
Perhaps few other neighbors may also wake up.</p><p>The world head quarters has nothing to do with any organization. It
is simply my secretariat. That's why I have given it a name `Rajneesh
Foundation International - world headquarters of Bhagwan Shree
Rajneesh'.</p><p>It has nothing to do with anybody else. It is my personal secretariat
where all the correspondence from the world can reach, from where people
can find where am I, in which country's jail. Otherwise millions of
sannyasins around the world were in a difficulty, they could not keep
track of me. America was changing jails every two day, just, sometimes
even one night I was in one jail and the next day I was in another jail.
I said, "Your jails are all alike. Why you are unnecessarily taking this
trouble?"</p><p>The reason was that nobody should know where I am. But they could not
manage, because from the airport, the news media was present. Every jail
was surrounded by news media twenty-four hours. Any time they take me
out, the news media is there. They take me in, the news media is there.
And the American news media is the most efficient in the world. Within
seconds the whole country will know where I am.</p><p>The world headquarters will be publishing my books, will be releasing
my tapes, videotapes, will be doing every kind of work. But it has no
domination over anybody. All communes of the world are independent. All
centers of the world are absolutely free. They are under nobody's
guidance. My sannyasins are directly related to me. The world
head-quarters will simply function so that you can have a connection
with me. Otherwise you don't have any place to whom to ask where I am,
what is happening to me. The world head-quarters is not in any way a
power over any sannyasin, over any other sannyas centers, ashramas,
communes. It has nothing to do that. It is my secretariat. And its
function is to convey to me messages of importance and to convey to the
sannyasins my messages of any importance to anybody. It is not an
organization. It is not a structure. It is simply a functional
office.</p><p><br></p><p>BELOVED BHAGWAN,</p><p>HOW CAN WE IN THE RAJNEESH TIMES SPREAD YOUR VISION IF WE PERSONALLY
ARE OFTEN SO INSECURE ABOUT WHAT YOUR VISION ACTUALLY IS?</p><p>I can understand the difficulty. It is not only your difficulty, it
is the difficulty of every sannyasin everywhere. The moment somebody
asks you "What is the vision of your master? What he wants to do? What
are the disciplines that he has given to you?" And you are in a
difficulty. Because I have not given any disciplines to you. And they
are accustomed of the old religions, Christians have their own
catechism, just a small booklet in which all that is essential to
Christianity is written.</p><p>You can just look at within few minutes and you know what
Christianity is. Jews have ten commandments, Jainas have their five
principles and in the same way</p><p>all the religions, their belief in a God, their belief in a heaven in
a hell, their belief what is good and what is bad, their certainty about
what is sin and what is virtue and their clear declaration that those
who are virtuous will be rewarded in heaven and those who are sinners
will be thrown in the darkness of the hell for eternity to suffer.</p><p>Things are simple for these people. And naturally everybody knows
about all these religions. They ask you the same question. But they
don't know that I am not preaching a religion.</p><p>The first thing to be made clear to them is that what I am teaching
is a religiousness, a quality. Religion is a dead dogma, fixed
principles. Frozen fossils. What I am teaching to you is a living,
flowing religiousness -- an experience like love. An experience that is
individual, all the religions are collective. They belong to the crowd.
And my whole effort is to make you free from the crowd and from the
collective so that you can be yourself, so that you can blossom to your
own potentiality, to your individuality. I am an individualist.</p><p>My vision about man is that he needs no organization. He needs
freedom from all organizations. All organizations cripple him, blind
him, destroy him. The life of the organization is the death of the
individual. Because the organization demands obedience. It is not a
question of right and wrong. It is a question that you should obey
whatever is written in the scriptures, whatever is ancient, whatever has
been always followed. You should not question.</p><p>My state is just the opposite. You should question everything. It is
your life. And unless you question, you cannot get rid of garbage and
crap. All the religions ask you to believe. My vision is that the
greatest crime against yourself is believing, because believing means:
you don't know yet you start feeling as if you know.</p><p>I am all for knowing and I am absolutely against for belief. Because
belief prevents people from knowing. When you already believe, your
enquiry stops. There is no need. Gautam Buddha has known, that's enough.
What more you can do. Just believe in him, worship him. But remember one
thing: when you are thirsty, then you never think that Gautam Buddha has
drunk water enough. There is no need for you to drink.</p><p>Even to say that you are thirsty is a sin. When you are hungry, you
are hungry and you need food. Gautam Buddha may have eaten -- eighty
years he lived -- that does not make any difference to your hunger. If
on the physical level it is not possible, how it is possible on the
spiritual level? Buddha may have known that can not make you
enlightened. You will have to know yourself.</p><p>Each individual has to travel the path. Nobody else can travel the
path on your behalf. The old religions have made things very simple. But
by making them simple, they have destroyed so much that the whole
humanity lives in misery because of it. What is good today, may not be
good tomorrow. What is good to me, may not be good to you.</p><p>Each individual has to be conscious, alert, watchful, an experiment
with life. And find out what is good for him. Whatever gives you peace,
whatever makes you blissful, whatever gives you serenity, whatever
brings you closer to existence and its immense harmony, is good. I
cannot point out to you `this is good' and</p><p>`this is wrong'.</p><p>And whatever creates conflict in you, misery in you, pain in you, is
wrong. Nobody else can decide it for you, because every individual has
his own world, his own sensitivity. He is unique. So that formulas are
not going to work, they have not worked. The whole world is a proof of
it.</p><p>Never ask anybody what is right and what is wrong. Life is an
experiment to find out what is right, what is wrong. Sometimes you may
commit what is wrong, but that will give you the experience of it, that
will make you aware of it that is has to be avoided. Sometimes you may
do something good and immensely you will be benefited. The rewards are
not beyond life, in heaven and hell. They are here and now.</p><p>Each action brings its result immediately. Just be alert and watch. I
call the man mature who has watched and found himself what is right,
what is wrong, what is good, what is bad. And by finding it by himself,
he has a tremendous authority. He knows it absolutely. The whole world
may say something else, it makes no difference to him. The whole world
may be against him -- it is not a question of voting. He has his
experience and that is decisive. One thing.</p><p>Second thing: the man who has found maturity by his own experiments
-- and life gives you so many opportunities, every moment they are
available. Don't miss any opportunity. Good or bad, don't decide
beforehand. Go through the experience and let the decision come
afterwards. Let the experience be your conclusion. This will help you to
know one thing more that `don't interfere with others'. This will give
you the insight that `help others to be themselves'. Tell them to
experiment, tell them it is not wrong to commit mistakes. Because every
mistake is a part of learning.</p><p>But man for thousands years have been fed up- - from his very
childhood, what is right, what is wrong, what is good, what is bad. So
naturally he ask my sannyasins, too. That "What is the vision of your
master?"</p><p>Tell them that, "My master is not an imprisonment to me. He is a
freedom to me. He has not given me details of things. He has simply
given me methods how to find details myself. He has not shown me the
way. He has given me eyes so that I can find my way."</p><p><br></p><p>And each individual's way is going to be different. Never follow
anybody. That is the greatest calamity that can happen to a man. Once
you start following somebody else, you become a carbon copy. You become
an imitation. You loose originality. So whoever asks you, "What vision
your master has given to you?", tell them that he has given freedom to
us. And he has provoked and challenged us to find our original face.</p><p>And that is possible only if you do not imitate.</p><p>BELOVED BHAGWAN,</p><p>WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ESOTERICS AND ESOTERIC NONSENSE?</p><p>Whatever I have been telling to you, is esoterics. I am trying to
make you mystics, masters of your own, helping you to find the mystery
of life without giving you any map, without giving you any guide-book.
Because that spoils the whole game.</p><p>It is like you see a beautiful film. And you start telling the story
to the friend. And you love the friend. And you have brought tickets for
the friend for tomorrow.</p><p>That's a good gesture. But please don't tell the story. Otherwise
that friend will be simply bored in the film -- the same beautiful film
will become just a boring experience. Because he will already what is
going to happen. There will be no curiosity, there will be no
possibility of anything new to happen.</p><p>He already knows. I have heard when for the first time films started
in India in a small village, there were three shows: the matinee show.
And one old man watched it. Then the show was finished but he won't
move. He said, "I want the ticket for the first show." The manager said,
"But you have seen." He said, "You wait, you don't interfere. This is
none your business. This is the money. Give me the ticket. I will see
the first show also." After first show he said, "Now I want to see the
second show also."</p><p>The manager said, "You seem to be a strange fellow. You are seeing
the same story again and again. And you don't seem to be bored."</p><p>He said, "You will not be satisfied unless I answer you. There is a
scene in the film. A beautiful woman by the side of a lake is
undressing. She has almost undressed and at that very moment, a train
passes by." The old fellow tries every way to see to the other side, but
the woman is other side and by the time the train has passed, the woman
is swimming in the lake and he could not see her undressed completely.
He said, "I will not leave this place, because I know these Indian
trains sometimes go late. How long this train is going to be in
time?"</p><p>Don't tell the story. Tickets are good. I give you every incentive,
every challenge to go on the journey. But I don't tell you what you are
going to meet what is going to happen on the journey. That will spoil
the whole mystery of it. Esoterics is the science of challenging people
that life is not appears. It is much more. It is always much more. You
will never come to a place where you can say, "Now it is enough." It is
never enough. What I call esoteric nonsense, is those people who start
giving you charts, maps, guides -- start in detail telling you every
phase of your journey. They kill, even the desire to go on the path.</p><p>I was in Agra. There is a small religion called Radhaswamis. You can
see in Radhaswamis how religions had been fighting egoistically with
each other. For</p><p>two hundred yeas, Radhaswamis have been making a temple in the memory
of their guru, but the idea is to make a temple which defeats Taj Mahal,
because both are in Agra. Two hundred years continuously, only the
ground floor is ready. Only the pillars. They have done tremendous job,
and if they succeed, there are very remote possibilities to complete it;
because two hundred years they have already worked. They are pouring all
their money, from all over the country, wherever their followers are.
But whatever they have made gives an indication that if they succeed,
Taj Mahal will become secondary.</p><p>When I was in Agra, speaking they invited me to see their incomplete
temple. They are in a very great despair because money is running out,
no more sources. There is not even a roof. But even on the pillars, the
work that they have done -- perhaps marble has never found such great
artists. When I was looking at their temple, I came across a map that
was hanging on the wall. I said, "What is that? I have never seen such a
map." They said, "This is the map of the higher stages of
consciousness." There are sixteen stages, and on the map, on the fifth
stage -- Mohammed, Moses, people like that, names are written, somewhat
higher. On the seventh stage Nanak, Kabir, Dadu and others. Somewhat
still higher, on the tenth, Krishna, Ram. Still higher on the eleventh,
Gautam Buddha, Mahavira. On the sixteenth, only their guru, their
master, has reached. They said, "What do you say?" I said, "Absolutely
right. Your guru is on the sixteenth." They said, "You are the first man
who do not belong to our religion, who are so absolutely certain." I
said, "I have to be absolutely certain because I am on the seventeenth,
and I see your poor guru on the sixteenth. he tries to get on on the
seventeenth and I go on pushing him down. Seventeenth is the last, and I
am not going to allow anybody else there. I don't like anybody. I want
to live alone, peacefully, your guru has to remain on sixteenth. He can
go downwards, fifteenth, fourteenth -- which are vacant, there is
nobody."</p><p>They were shocked. They said, "Are you serious?" I said, "I'm always
serious, and I have to be serious, because your guru is trying every
possible way somehow to enter in the seventeenth. And I have to make all
arrangements to block his path. In fact I have removed the staircase
also. There is no hope for your guru to enter in the seventeenth." They
said, "This is strange. But we have never heard about the seventeenth."
I said, "Who had heard about the sixteenth?"</p><p>This is esoteric nonsense. Esoterics is a mystic phenomenon. Esoteric
nonsense is expressed in such things. You will not believe that in Jaina
temples there used to be maps. I don't know whether there are still or
not, because I have not entered a Jaina temple for twenty years. It is
not right to say I have not entered -- they will not let me in!</p><p>Krishna is in the seventh hell... because Jainas believe in seven
hells. It is a very mathematical idea -- to put all the sinners in one
hell, seems to be very unmathematical. Somebody has been only smoking
cigarettes and has done nothing wrong to anybody, except to himself. And
somebody has killed, like Adolf Hitler, six million people. Now to put
them into one place, seems to be</p><p>absolutely unjustified. So Jainas have seven hells -- seven
categories, according to your sin, crime, you will be sent. Krishna is
in the seventh, the last, because he was the man who provoked Arjuna for
Mahabharata, the great Indian war, in which millions of people died. The
whole responsibility goes on him -- and because to Jainas nonviolence is
the criterion of religion -- he was the most important person to preach
violence.</p><p>When Mahavira was alive, one of his disciples hoped that he will
become the successor of Mahavira. But seeing that Mahavira goes on
living, he became frustrated. He propped Mahavira and moved away from
Mahavira taking his five hundred disciples with him, because he said
this man does not know enough. He says there are only seven hells --
that is wrong. There are seventy- seven hells. Because it is impossible
to categorize all crimes and all sins into seven categories --
seventy-seven hells. Now you cannot prove these people; not disprove
these people. It is just their imagination.</p><p>Hearing this, another man, whom I like -- Sanjay Belattiputta -- he
said, "This man is an idiot! It is better than seven, but really there
are seven hundred hells." He was joking, he was not serious, but he was
simply saying, that all these things are simply nonsense. In the name of
religion you can go on propagating any kind of nonsense.</p><p>I have heard that -- At last Morarji Desai died. I don't know whether
he has died or not. It is just hearsay. And everyone who dies is first
brought into hell, and hell has such a beautiful reception room --
beautiful naked ladies, champagne flowing, all kinds of cold drinks,
every kind of food... you say and it is immediately presented by naked
women. Morarji said, "This is strange... this is hell? What great
pleasures must not be happening in heaven? But this is the root. Hell
comes first, then the bus goes to heaven. And he was very much puzzled
again. Heaven looked like a ruin -- old skeletons walking; you cannot
even recognize who is who, saints, mahatmas, sages, but there is no
greenery, no reception place. He said, "This is not a place worth
living. Hell was far better. Improved in every way, everything is
available. No sign of poverty. He said to the bus driver that, "Please
when you go back, I want to go back to hell." He said, "Think twice
before you decide." He said, "I have decided." He went to hell and a he
entered, the devil caught hold of him and said, "So you have come." But
he said, "Where is the reception place?" The devil said, "You are an
idiot. That was just a reception place. That is to allure idiots for
hell. Now you will see the reality."</p><p>The bus has gone. There was no way. He said, "Still, because you have
come by yourself -- you have chosen it yourself, I will give you again a
choice." He took him to the first room. It was so horrible. People were
being cut by electric saws and again joined for another cut. It was so
painful. Everybody was naked, and one can see that how many cuts a man
has gone through. You could count the scars. And they had really
invented a glue that you cut the body in two, glue it, put it back, and
sometimes those small devils who were doing all this work, they</p><p>will put two persons' bodies and changes the head of one, the body of
another. It was looking very ugly. Everybody was in torture. The devil
asked, "Would you like to join this group? It is a group therapy."
Morarji said, "No.Â I would like to see the other two."</p><p>In the second one, it was even more horrible. There was no electric
saws -- people were being cut by old type of axes, like trees are cut.
Somebody's leg will be cut and joined to somebody else's leg. Somebody's
head will be cut and will be joined to somebody else's head. Morarji
said, "What is this?" He said, "This is old type. There are people who
like old things, ancient, traditional. Few people like technology,
science. For them the first room. This is for the more religious, more
traditional, those who go on spinning reels. Perhaps this may suit you.
He said,</p><p>`No, this is too much. I would like to see the third one." And the
third one looked a relief. A great relief! Seeing the two, the third was
certainly a relief. People were standing into crap of all kinds -- up to
their neck. Somebody drinking tea, somebody drinking coffee. It was
stinking, but Morarji said, "It is better." And as far as crap is
concerned, fifty percent he has prepared already. Whole life drinking of
urine, now, he does not smell anything. But it is good that you are
provided with coffee and tea. So he said, "This is good. Although it
does not look good to stand into this mess that you have collected here.
How old it is?" He said, "This is the ancientmost thing. We are great
collectors. Antiques we pay very much interest. Nothing is new here.
Thousands of years old things. This shit that you are seeing all around.
This comes from the days of Vedas. It is sacred. Go into it and enjoy.
What do you want, a coffee?" He said, "I don't like coffee or tea. I
drink my own urine." Devil said, "That's perfectly okay. That freedom is
given to you. You can drink as much as you want."</p><p>An empty cup was given to him to drink his own urine. Just in the
middle when he was drinking his urine, a bell started ringing and a
small devil shouting that the coffee break is over. Now throw all your
cups and coffees and stand on your head. Now begins the yoga
exercises.</p><p>This was not known to him that this was going to be. It was already
too much, and now standing on your head. But you cannot do only this.
Three places are there and you have chosen itself.</p><p>All religions have ideas about heaven, about hell. This is all
esoteric nonsense. Real esoterics simply means the science of knowing
thyself.</p><p>Okay?</p><h1 style=padding-top:3pt;padding-left:6pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=the-last-testament-vol-6-chapter-14>The Last Testament, Vol 6

which has not been published, as of August 1992.]</p><p>INTERVIEW WITH PRESS NAMED 'MIDDAY'</p><p><br></p><p>Q: GOOD EVENING, AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR SEEING ME. IT'S A
PLEASURE TO SEE YOU AGAIN IN INDIA. I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS HERE IF YOU
COULD PLEASE ANSWER THEM. YOU HAVE BEEN GRANTING INTERVIEWS TO
JOURNALISTS AT THE SAME TIME YOU HAVE BEEN TAKING YOUR DISCOURSES,
GIVING DISCOURSES, TO YOUR SANNYASINS. IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR REASON
FOR THIS, BHAGWAN?</p><p><br></p><p>A: It makes no difference to me whether I talk to my sannyasins or to
the journalists, because finally the word will reach to my
sannyasins.</p><p>Through the journalists, it will reach to others also.</p><p>There are many people who would like to listen to me but cannot come
for many reasons. Their orthodox mind, their traditional thinking, lies
that they have heard about me... through journalism it is possible to
reach even these people. Journalism is simply a means and I use all the
means possible to spread the fragrance that has happened to me.</p><p>I have chosen particularly journalists because even if I do not talk
to them they go on writing about me all kinds of stupidities, lies... it
is better they should talk with me, have a clear conception about me. It
is their duty to their readers that the truth is conveyed and lies are
not spread. I respect journalism tremendously because it is one of the
greatest means to protect the individual, his freedom of expression, his
individuality, against the powerful vested interests.</p><p>I am alone against the vested interests -- they have immense power,
but if the news media is with me to convey the truth to the masses -- a
single individual can be more powerful than a government.</p><p>And I have seen this happen in America. The news media has the credit
that the American government could not murder me. They had made every
arrangement</p><p>-- I will give you just few examples...</p><p>In one prison they asked me to fill the form but not to write my name
on it. The Marshall asked me to write David Washington as my name and
told me that, "In the jail you will be called David Washington, and you
have to respond to this name."</p><p>I refused and I told that man that, "First, you remove your coat." On
his coat there was a seal saying Department of Justice and feel ashamed
of yourself that you are the highest authority of justice in America,
asking me to do something absolutely illegal. And what is the reason? It
is so simple that I write David Washington and you poison me in the
night and nobody will be able even to find it out that where I
disappeared. Perhaps on the aeroplane also, you had entered my name as
David Washington. So David Washington comes to the jail and tomorrow you
can release him. I simply disappear in the air. It is not so easy to
befool me. I will write my name -- if you want to go home because it was
midnight, otherwise you fill the form in your handwriting, write
whatsoever you want... I will sign it.</p><p>He wanted to go home. Tired... he himself was. He filled the form as
David Washington. My strategy was clear and I signed my signature which
are known all over the world. He looked at my signature and he said, "I
do not understand what you have written."</p><p>I said, "There is no need for you to understand. This is my
signature. This is not David Washington's signature. Now you can kill
me. And remember, whether you kill me or not, in the morning every
newspaper and every television station and every radio will carry the
news... the whole idea of democracy is simply in the words. In reality,
it is a hypocrisy."</p><p>While coming to the jail there was a woman with me, a prisoner, a
black woman. She asked me can she be of some help because she is going
to be released tomorrow morning. If there is any message to the
newspapers, to the news media, who are surrounding the jail you can give
it to me.</p><p>I told her just listen carefully the talk between me and the Marshall
and whatever transpires you report to the news media.</p><p>The next morning the whole America was agog that this is simply a
fascist regime pretending to be democratic. There seems to be no respect
for the individual. They removed me from the jail immediately because
they wanted to destroy the form.</p><p>In the second jail, they put me in a cell with a man who had Aids.
And who was just dying. At the most seven days more were left for his
death. For six months he has been there and nobody has shared the cell
because the doctor has told that no other prisoner should be put there.
The disease is so dangerous and so infectious that anybody who lives
with him is bound to get it.</p><p>They put me in that cell. As they left, the man himself said to me
"Bhagwan, I have been seeing you on the television and this is nothing
but a cunning strategy to kill you. I am dying from Aids. Please don't
touch anything in the cell. Knock on the doors till all the parties come
and force them to change you from this place to another. And I am with
you. I am dying, but I am still human. These people who have put here,
only look human. This doctor has not allowed even murderers to enter
this cell. This doctor himself never enters the cell. He enquires about
me from the outside. You have not done any crime, you have been
arrested</p><p>without any arrest warrant. You have not been allowed the facility to
contact your attorneys and now they put you in a cell which is nothing
but sure death."</p><p>I had to knock the door for continuously one hour. Then the jailer
appeared, then the doctor appeared, and I asked them, that "Are you
aware that this man has Aids? Are you aware that for six months you have
not been putting anybody in the cell? Then why you have put me in this
cell? And I am not a criminal. You have not even proved before a court
that I have committed any crime. You are criminals because you are
trying to kill a man who has not done anything wrong."</p><p>They became so afraid -- afraid of whom? Afraid of the news media.
Because I told them, "As I get out of the jail I'm going to tell to the
news media what happened with me. This doctor is not a doctor of light.
He should be punished and the only punishment can be he should be put in
this cell with this man."</p><p>I was removed immediately to another cell and they removed me as
early as possible thinking that there will be no news media people
outside, but America has a very awakened, alert news media. They were
there twenty-four hours around any jail I was. They were following the
cars on their helicopters. They could not manage to hide me in some
place where the news media was not aware.</p><p>I respect news media. But I would like to say that Indian journalism
is not yet of that great quality. It is third rate.</p><p>Without asking me they go on saying things that I have never said.
This is the reason why I am giving these interviews.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: I HAVE A SUPPLEMENTARY QUESTION TO THIS IF I MAY, BEFORE I GO ON
TO THE NEXT ONE.</p><p>YOU HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT HOW IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE A FREE AND
FEARLESS MEDIA AND ABOUT HOW YOU ARE ANSWERING ALL THESE QUESTIONS SO
THAT INDIAN JOURNALISTS CAN WRITE ABOUT IT SO THAT IT CAN GO TO OTHER
PEOPLE.</p><p>I HAVE SUBMITTED A LIST OF QUESTIONS: IMPORTANT QUESTIONS IN OUR
OPINION, WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE IF YOU HAD ANSWERED THEM BECAUSE IT
WOULD HAVE CLEARED A LOT OF MISCONCEPTIONS. BUT I FIND THAT THESE
QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN CANCELLED FROM MY ORIGINAL QUESTIONNAIRE. I HAVE
EVEN BEEN ASKED NOT TO ASK YOU THESE QUESTIONS.</p><p><br></p><p>A: Those questions were rubbish. I simply did not want to call your
questions before the people `rubbish'. That's why I cancelled them.</p><p>But if you are interested in rubbish you can ask. But then be
prepared.</p><p>I have chosen the best questions that you have asked -- because my
whole effort is that you should inform the people about the basic
things. My fundamental approaches about life, about religion, about
philosophy, about people's mind and</p><p>how it can be transformed. Those questions that I have answered are
out of compassion for you. I did not want to insult a lady, but if you
are not a lady you can ask. But remember, then I will not be a
gentleman.</p><p>I'M AFRAID I'M A JOURNALIST FIRST AND A LADY AFTERWARDS SO OF ALL
THESE QUESTIONS, I'LL HAVE TO ASK YOU ONE AT LEAST. ONE OF THE QUESTIONS
THAT YOU HAVE CUT OUT IS, WAS ASKED, MORE FROM A GENUINE CONCERN FOR
YOUR WELL-BEING THAN ANYTHING ELSE. THIS WAS THE QUESTION PERTAINING TO
THE FACT THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS AREA ARE QUITE UPSET WITH WHAT
THEY CONSIDER IS CONFUSION AND COMMOTION. THEY SEE THAT THEIR CHILDREN
WILL BE UNDULY, LET'S SAY, THEY'LL BE UNDULY INFLUENCED. SOME TIME AGO
WE HAD ALSO CARRIED A VERY BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN ARTICLE BY ONE OF YOUR
DISCIPLES ON HOW SHE FELT ON YOUR RETURN. BUT MUCH OF THE FEEDBACK THAT
WE HAVE GOT HAS BEEN VERY VIOLENT. THEY'RE EXTREMELY VIOLENT, TO THE
POINT THAT WE'VE HAD TO THROW ALL OF IT OUT. NOW IF THERE IS SUCH AN
UNDERCURRENT AGAINST YOU, DOES THAT WORRY YOU?</p><p>These are the people who do not understand me. And these are the
people who do not want their children to grow. These are the people who
do not want to help this country move into contemporary times. These are
the obstacles in the evolution of this country.</p><p>They should come here with their children. They should ask questions
concerning the growth of their children, the education of their
children, the morality of their children. The answers that they cannot
give, I am ready to give. That's what is making them upset.</p><p>I say there is no God. Now catch hold of those people who are upset.
Let them prove that there is God. If they cannot prove then it is simple
sincerity to accept that our God is only a belief, not an experience.
Don't give to your children beliefs. Those beliefs have been killing
this country for centuries. This country has lived almost ten thousand
years of a very civilized past. Yet it is hungry, yet it has no
scientific attitude towards life. No technological approaches, which can
transform the poverty. And the reason is that every child is being fed
up with belief while science depends on doubt.</p><p>I teach doubting... and unless you have the courage to doubt you will
never come to know the truth. Your truth will always be borrowed and a
borrowed truth is not a truth.</p><p>Those people who are upset prove by their being upset that they are
wrong. I am not upset, I am not upset that the great majority of people
will destroy the meditations of my sannyasins.</p><p>They are a vast ocean... and my sannyasins are just like a dewdrop.
The dewdrop is not afraid of the ocean and the ocean is upset of a
dewdrop. It must be important.</p><p>Their beliefs are empty of any content. Otherwise they should be
happy that I am here. They should bring their children. They should help
their children to ask questions that they cannot answer.</p><p>A morality which is afraid of intelligence is not a morality. It is
the greatest immoral thing in the world.</p><p>A religion which is afraid of being questioned shows clearly that it
knows deep down that there are no foundations to its temple.</p><p>And this is not only the question of the people here. This is the
question of the people around the world.</p><p>Socrates was condemned by the Greeks. Their own greatest flowering,
their own genius. The Greeks never could reach higher than Socrates --
in intelligence -- yet they condemned him. And the reason: they were
afraid that his influence can corrupt their children.</p><p>Socrates' influence can corrupt their children. Their stupidity
cannot corrupt their children but really what they call corruption is
Socrates can expose and that's my function too.</p><p>I can expose all lies that you have been telling to your children.
That is your fear. You are afraid of truth: and you call that truth can
corrupt. Yes, truth can corrupt lies.</p><p>I bring a medicine and you are sick. Medicine can destroy your
sickness. So whoever is upset is invited. Either I will upset him
completely and he will be a sannyasin, or I am ready to be upset
completely and be a follower to him.</p><p>This is how human beings should behave with each other. This is how
intelligence requires that people should interact. I am not saying that
"Agree with me" -- I am inviting you. Come with all your disagreement,
but without understanding me, without listening me, if people get upset
that simply shows their weakness, their retardedness.</p><p>I crossed that question simply because I don't want to call anybody
retarded. I don't want to call anybody stupid. But your question cannot
be answered unless I say the truth. Only intellectually retarded people
are upset. Intelligent people are never upset. In fact, intelligent
people are always in search of someone who can upset them, because that
will be a new beginning of a journey. A new search, in a new
dimension.</p><p>Only retarded people don't want to hear anything that goes beyond
their mind. They are perfectly satisfied like buffaloes, chewing the
same grass their whole life. Don't upset a buffalo.</p><p>But the whole progress of man depends on those few people who have
been courageous enough to upset us, who have destroyed our old beliefs,
who have punctured our old moralities, who has given us visions of a new
world, of a new</p><p>future, who have taken us out of the past and its bondage into the
freedom of the future.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING THAT ONE. WHAT DO YOU, YOU FORESEE AS THE
FUTURE OF YOUR SANNYAS MOVEMENT? DO YOU SEE IT AS PROSPERING, EVEN WHEN
YOU'RE NOT HERE?</p><p><br></p><p>A: Sannyas movement is not mine. It is not yours. It was here when I
was not here. It will be here when I will not be here.</p><p>Sannyas movement simply means the movement of the seekers of truth.
They have always been here.</p><p>Of course, they have been always tortured by the ignorant masses:
killed, murdered, crucified, or worshipped.</p><p>Remember: it is the same whether you crucify or you worship. Both are
the ways how to get rid of those people. One is crucifixion, another is
worship. Worship is more cultured. We say you are an incarnation of God,
we will worship you. But we will not do what you say. How can we do? We
are ordinary human beings. You were extraordinary -- either you were a
prophet sent by God, or a messenger, or the only begotten son of God, or
you were a reincarnation of God -</p><p>- you could do miracles. We have created all kinds of miracles, only
for one reason. To create a distance between us and the people who have
been seeking the truth and the people who have ultimately found the
truth. We were not ready to go with them. There were only two ways:
either to kill them, destroy them, so we can forget them and forgive
them.</p><p>They were a disturbing element, a nuisance. We were asleep and having
such beautiful dreams and a Gautam Buddha comes and starts shaking you
and tells, "Wake up!" Naturally you get angry.</p><p>There have always been a line of seekers of truth... I call it
sannyas. It is eternal. It is sanatan. It has nothing to do with me.</p><p>Millions of people have contributed to it. I have also contributed my
own share. It will go on becoming more and more richer. When I am gone
there will be more and more people coming and making it richer. The old
sannyas was serious. I have contributed to it a sense of humor. The old
sannyas was sad. I have contributed to it singing, dancing, laughing...
I have made it more human.</p><p>The old sannyas was somehow life-negative. I have made it life-
affirmative. But it is the same sannyas. It is the same search. I have
made it more rich. I have made it more grounded in the world because my
whole teaching is `be in the world, but don't be of the world.'</p><p>There is no need to renounce the world. Only cowards renounce it.
Live in the world, experience it. It is a school. You cannot grow in the
Himalayas. You can only grow in the world.</p><p>Each step is an examination. Each step you are passing through a
test. Life is an opportunity.</p><p>I will be gone. That does not mean that the sannyas movement will be
gone. It does not belong to anybody.</p><p>Just as science does not belong to Albert Einstein. Why the search
for truth should belong to somebody? To Gautam Buddha? To J
Krishnamurti? Or to me? Or to you?</p><p>Just as science goes on growing and every scientific genius goes on
contributing to it and the Ganges goes on becoming bigger and wider --
oceanic; in the same way the inner world needs a science. The objective
world has a science. The inner world needs a science and I call sannyas
the science of the inner world. It has been growing but because it goes
against humanities attachments, ignorance, superstitions, so-called
religions, churches, priests, popes, shankaracharyas... these are the
enemies of the inner search because the inner search needs no
organization.</p><p>Sannyas movement is not an organization: that is why I call it
`movement'. It is individual. People join. I had started alone and then
people started coming and joining me and slowly, slowly the caravan
became bigger and bigger. But it is not an organization. I am nobody's
leader. Nobody has to follow me. I am grateful that you have allowed me
to share my bliss, my love, my ecstasy. I am grateful to you. Nobody is
my follower, nobody is lower. There is no hierarchy. It is not a
religion. It is pure religiousness. The very essence. Not a flower, but
only a fragrance. You cannot catch hold of it.</p><p>You can have the experience of it, you can be surrounded by the
perfume, but you cannot catch hold of it.</p><p>Religions are like dead flowers you can find in Bibles, in Gitas...
When they were put in the Bible they were living, they were fragrant,
but now it is only a corpse. All holy books are corpses, dead flowers
and nothing else.</p><p>Truth, the living truth, has to be discovered by each individual by
himself. Nobody can give it to you.</p><p>Yes, somebody who has achieved it can transpire a thirst in you, a
tremendous desire for it. I cannot give you the truth, but I can give
you the desire for it.</p><p>I cannot give you the truth, but I can show you the moon... please
don't get attached to my finger which is indicating the moon. This
finger will disappear. The moon will remain and the search will
continue.</p><p>As long as there is a single human being on the earth the flowers of
sannyas will go on blossoming.</p><p>Q: BUT THERE IS SOMETHING THAT IS PARTICULARLY SPECIAL ABOUT YOU THAT
BINDS SO MANY OF YOUR SANNYASINS TO YOU. WHAT IS IT? HOW WOULD YOU
DESCRIBE IT?</p><p>A: There are many things -- not one. Why sannyasins are so much deep
in love with me.</p><p>First, I am the only man in the whole history who gives you
individuality. The so-called gurus were doing just the opposite: they
were taking away your individuality. Their whole effort was that you
should surrender to them. That your function was just to touch their
feet and receive their blessings.</p><p>My effort is totally different. You cannot receive any blessing by
touching anybody's feet. On the contrary, you are making that man more
egoistic and sick. Ego is the cancer of his soul. Don't make anybody
sick. Be compassionate. Never touch anybody's feet.</p><p>I give you self-respect, which nobody has given before. I make every
effort to make you an individual standing on your own feet, not
dependent on me.</p><p>It is a strange phenomenon because I give you freedom, you love me.
Because I make you yourself, you love me.</p><p>My effort is to take away all traditions, orthodoxies, superstitions,
beliefs, from your mind so that you can attain a state of no-mind... the
ultimate state of silence, where not even a thought moves. Not even a
ripple in the lake of your consciousness.</p><p>And the whole thing has to be done by you. I am not saying that "Just
follow me. I am the savior. I will save you." All that is crap. Nobody
can save you, except yourself. And the spiritual independence is the
only independence worth calling independence. All other independences --
political, economic, are just so so, superficial.</p><p>But the real and authentic independence is that you are not dependent
for your inner growth on anybody. Those who have come to me have become
more and more independent. More and more themselves. That's why they
love me. I am not making them a crowd, I am making them absolutely
individuals. I am not even giving them ideologies to be practised...
disciplines to be practised, I am simply sharing my own experience. Out
of that experience they have to find their own discipline.</p><p>This is a company not of a master and disciples, this is a company of
a master and potential masters.</p><p><br></p><p>Q: THANK YOU. JUST ONE MORE QUESTION. YOU HAVE SAID IN AN EARLIER
INTERVIEW THAT THIS IS NOT YOUR FINAL RESTING PLACE... THAT YOU'LL
PROBABLY MOVE SOMEWHERE ELSE. HAVE YOU MORE OR LESS THOUGHT ABOUT WHERE
YOU PLAN ON MOVING? ANY PARTICULAR... NOT POONA? I THINK IT WILL BE
SHUTTING DOWN... IS POONA SHUT?"</p><p>A: No, the Poona ashram will continue. I am not going to Poona. I
will be staying in Bombay... now I have to upset Bombay. Poona I have
upset enough.</p><p>And then there are many other places which are left and it is not
right, they need being upset.</p><p>So I will be moving to new places, upsetting people. When they get
upset enough then I will move to another place. My remaining life is
going to be a wandering upsetter.</p><p>The Last Testament, Vol 6 Chapter #16</p><p>Chapter title: None</p><p>21 July 1989 am in LaoTzu House, Poona, India</p><p><br></p><p>Archive code: 8907210 ShortTitle: LAST616 Audio: Yes</p><p>Video: No</p><p><br></p><p>[NOTE: This is a typed tape transcript and has not been edited or
published, as of August 1992. It is for reference use only.]</p><p>Interview with Swami Satya Vedant asking questions from Pritish
Nandy, Illustrated Weekly of India,</p><p>Osho: So, I should address to Shree Pritish, that will be better.
VEDANT: BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>IN VIEW OF THE UPCOMING GENERAL ELECTIONS, THE EDITOR OF ILLUSTRATED
WEEKLY, MR. PRITISH NANDY HAS REQUESTED YOUR VIEWS ON A VARIETY OF
ISSUES CONFRONTING INDIA TODAY.</p><p>THE FIRST QUESTION:</p><p>WHAT IN YOUR VIEW SHOULD BE INDIA'S EDUCATIONAL POLICY?</p><p><br></p><p>Osho: Vedant, the Indian educational system was created by the
British empire to produce more clerks, more servile people. So the
British remained aloof, and in between this educational system created a
wall against the masses of India. So the first thing is that educational
system as a whole should not be producing clerks and masters. Its aim
should be to create painters, poets, sculptors. I am not saying that the
whole system should be thrown out, because few clerks will be
needed.</p><p>We have to sort out what creates a "servants" attitude. It is
obedience. More obedient you are, more a slave. The whole system was
created to produce more slaves, that was British empire's need. We have
to change and the whole dimension from creating slaves to creating
individuals, freedom, and a pride.</p><p>The second thing... Half of the education time should be given to
crafts, because neither history has to do anything with your life, nor
geography has anything to do. These should be optional subjects. We
should create more craftsmen, more</p><p>carpenters, more gardeners. In short, we will keep what is necessary
to be a independent man, and obedience should be completely erased. From
the very beginning a child should be supported in his individuality and
his pride into being a human, which is the highest consciousness
evolution has brought us.</p><p>This will reduce the problem of unemployment. In fact, nobody wants
to be employed in a system where he is just dispensable. He is inside
always in insecurity. A farmer, a gardener, a carpenter have their
original being uninterfered by government or by religion or by old and
rotten systems of thought.</p><p>And so much time has gone since freedom came to India, but it is a
very poor freedom. It has not brought the light and the flame of freedom
to the individual. Individual is more important than the society. We
cannot sacrifice the individual in the service of society.</p><p>That will bring a totally new atmosphere</p><p>But our educational system is based underneath on obedience. They can
become soldiers, they can become policemen, they can become clerks, they
can become part of any system where they are just numbers.</p><p>When a soldier dies, on the board of the campus it is not declared
who has died, number nine has died. It does not hurt us. But if the name
is written... Because number nine has no wife, no children, no longing
for to be independent; it is a dead thing. It is just a man-created
phenomenon. If number is removed and the name is placed, many more
soldiers will think twice whether to participate in this stupid
struggle. "My wife is waiting, my mother will be getting old. My father
needs me at this time. My children are growing and I have to look after
them. And what I am doing here? Just following orders. Left, I turn
left. Right, I turn right. And the man on the other side is doing the
same. He has not harmed me, I have not harmed him. We are not even
acquainted, and we are ready to kill each other."</p><p>So with the change of educational system, a great explosion of
freedom will come.</p><p>People need to be needed. That is their greatest longing. If they are
not needed and anybody can replace them, they are just a commodity. They
are not a father, they are not a husband; they don't love anybody.</p><p>So all that is unnecessary to teach and waste time, should be
optional. Or for what libraries exist? People should go -- if they have
an interest in geography and history, they look in the library. But more
basic things... And whenever you create something, when your rose bush
brings beautiful roses, you have a certain happiness that destruction
cannot have.</p><p>So education should be divided. A part we certainly need, but that
too will not be a slave. But the major part should be made creative, he
should not be dependent on anybody.</p><p>Students should be supported in making communes, not factories owned
by one individual. The commune owns everything and the commune provides
everybody's need. This is my conception of an authentic socialism.</p><p>VEDANT: SINCE YOU MENTION SOCIALISM, I HAVE A QUESTION. IS SOCIALISM
VIABLE, AND IS SOCIALISM RELEVANT TO INDIA?</p><p><br></p><p>Osho: Only socialism is relevant to India, and it is viable. After
seventy years of communist revolution in Russia, now they have come to
their senses that they have created a prison. And what Gorbachev is
doing is introducing socialism, not communism. The difference is that
the people should enjoy life, love life, be free for movement into other
countries -- no visa and no passport should be needed. This whole earth
is ours, nobody is alien.</p><p>The richest man, who is in Japan, who has twenty-six billion
dollars... What you are going to do with this twenty-six million
dollars... billion dollars? Even America is ashamed, because its richest
man has only four billion dollars.</p><p>Emphasis should be not on money. Emphasis should be health, love,
creativity, a feeling of communion, destroying all discrimination
between white and black, between rich and poor, between Hindu and the
Christian.</p><p>Socialism is not a religion; it is a revolution in all our life
patterns. A child is not born with a label that he is a Hindu.
Twenty-one years should be left as you conceive that the child is now
adult. If to vote you need at least twenty-one years, how can you make
somebody a Hindu or Muslim or Christian? You are exploiting the very
innocent people.</p><p>And religion should be searched by the individual himself. And in one
commune all kinds of religious people are accepted. That is a private
affair, it is not the business of any church to dominate.</p><p>Socialism will also look at the phenomenon that India, one of the
poorest country, has the biggest military force. They are just sitting.
They get everything, the best that you produce. The remaining people
receive the leftover. And there is no need for such a vast army. And in
a world where nuclear weapons are there, where suspicions are there that
deathrays have been perfected, no bomb, just a deathray which you will
not feel and you fall dead...</p><p>So all destructive structures -- army, navy, or air forces -- should
be put in the service of the people. There is no need. The generations
following will think that man has been mad -- only fighting. Life is not
for fighting; it is to sing and dance and enjoy.</p><p>Socialism is a freedom from all chains -- religion, the culture.
Whatever chains an individual into dependence, and calls obedience the
highest quality, is an enemy of humanity.</p><p>Adam was expelled from heaven just because he disobeyed God, and that
simple incidence contains the base of all religions.</p><p>Socialism is an unconditioning, a de-programming, and bringing forth
the natural potentialities of the individual. That is exactly the
meaning of education. It is not to put borrowed knowledge and force it
into the memory; it is to take out all borrowed knowledge so the
individual can see his own potentiality. And nobody can be happy ever,
unless he finds his potential and a great joy arises in him.</p><p>There is no need to kill people as communism has done. One million
people have been killed. And strange... For these people the revolution
was bringing the paradise. There is no need. Just remove the
foundations. Everything is social and nobody can be possessive.</p><p>I accept equality in a different sense. People have been teaching
equality in such a stupid way: that everybody should be equal. Somebody
is tall, and somebody is small, so cut the head or cut the legs. This is
not equality.</p><p>Equality means equal opportunity to bring your potential and
contribute to life, to the world, and to yourself, a joy. And as nuclear
weapons have come into existence, war has become out-of-date. It will be
a suicide, global suicide.</p><p>So it is time to destroy all barriers and proclaim a brotherhood of
the whole earth. And we will all share equal opportunity to do whatever
we want to do. In short, socialism is equal opportunity -- not equal men
-- equal opportunity to grow, to create, to love, without any
bondage.</p><p>Marriage is a bondage. Two persons can love and live together, and
the day they see they cannot, with gratitude towards each other for all
those beautiful days that have passed, they will say goodbye. And
children in a commune will belong, not to the father and mother; they
will belong to the commune. So that is not a question. They will be
living in commune hostels. They can meet their father and mother on
holidays, or father and mother can meet them.</p><p>Things are so complicated. A boy comes in contact with a woman which
is his mother, a girl comes biologically attracted towards the father.
And this is not possible. Neither the father can become the husband of
the girl, nor the mother can become the wife of the boy. But these
impressions in the mind... They search whole life, if some woman similar
-- maybe only partially similar to the mother -- the boy thinks he is
falling in love. He is not falling in love; he is only falling in the
shape of the nose, or the color of the eyes, or the hairdo. But how long
it will... Within few days it is finished. Marriage ends with the
honeymoon, then there is just a burden to be carried.</p><p>So no need for anybody to interfere into individual privacy. Up to
now this has been difficult because of the children -- what to do with
the children. But my conception of the commune is that all children go
to the commune house and come in contact with many women teachers, with
many male teachers, so their impact is vast. And only these people can
love. They don't fall in love because of the hairdo, and they are not
carrying the father-fixation.</p><p>I said that things are complicated, so interfering with every other
thing. The father-figure destroys the man, and the father-figure creates
the god. And god is a fiction. So he is miserable, always miserable.</p><p>Socialism can destroy this misery. There is no need of big cities,
high-rise buildings; they are simply prisons. People should move into
small communes where everybody is acquainted with everybody else, and
come closer to the nature, save the ecology which those high-rising
building were destroying. There is no need, because we are already
committing suicide by destroying the ecology. When India became
independent it has thirty-three million trees. And now it has only
eleven million trees, because unnecessary things... And with a
scientific progress things can take a tremendous quantum leap. For
example, television can be used in every school, college, university, to
teach. And it is easy to remember when you see it than when you read it.
Reading is just words on the paper, seeing is reality. And much more can
be shown to them through television. Right now television is killing
them.</p><p>Thirty-three million people in America are in hospitals. They had no
disease. Television is their disease. Seven and half hours average,
American is watching TV. And the TV is in the hands of big corporations,
so all that they do -- they propagate things with beautiful women, and
continuous repetition every day that "this butter is the best".</p><p>Now in America they have made a potato association, because they
don't want even to the effort to go to the kitchen, because by that time
something will be missed on the television. So they simply phone their
number and what they need, and from the hotel everything comes. They are
eating and seeing. So these potatoes have numbers for servicing them for
anything at their chair where they are making... They think that
something great is happening. On the one side corporations possessing
television is wrong, and on the other side, government possessing
television and radio is even more wrong. Because government -- whichever
party is in power -- will enforce ideas into people.</p><p>Television should be in the hands of the commune. And there is no
need for television from six o'clock in the morning till twelve in the
night. Three hours is enough. And universities can have their own
television studio to teach students. In fact, the teacher can become
only the operator. How a painter paints -- and you can see Picasso
painting. The best can be seen as if you are contemporary of Gautam
Buddha.</p><p>This will bring a great revolution, otherwise all these television
corporations are exploiting people. Or in a country like India,
government is holding television, radio, everything. They are creating
slavery. (End side A, Tape 1)</p><p><br></p><p>VEDANT: WHAT SHOULD BE THE ROLE OF DOORDARSHAN WITH REGARD TO
TELEVISION. AND COULD YOU PLEASE SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE FREEDOM OF THE
PRESS?</p><p>Osho: Freedom of all media -- whether it is television, radio, or
newspapers -- should not be in the hands which are running them to earn
money. And they should not be in the hands of the government. And so
many newspapers are unnecessary. And these newspapers are destroying the
trees. Every day millions of trees are needed to produce paper. It is
simply insane. A tree takes hundreds of years to grow, and a newspaper
becomes useless within minutes.</p><p>So the newspapers should be limited -- not their freedom -- because
they are all reporting the same. So every country can have a limited
number, and the owner will not be any individual; the commune will be
the owner. And not the rubbish that goes on filling people's mind...
should be cut off. Only what is essential, and people must know --
that's enough.</p><p>There are hundreds of scientific inventions. The governments have
given them their copyright and keeping them from the people, because
many capitalists will be afraid.</p><p>I know a scientist who has worked for twenty years in Hiroshima. He
comes here once, and then he becomes a sannyasin. And his experience is
that in a certain amount, radiation can destroy all diseases, and man
can remain happy. But that will mean it will affect people who are
producing medicines, doctors who are curing. So thereforth (?) And they
are the people who contribute to the parties for the elections. So
finally it is government who is hiding. And we don't now how many
inventions are lying in the government offices.</p><p>One Japanese scientist, who has also been here, has made petrol
function four times more. But nobody is going to allow him. Because if
petrol functions four times more, then the petrol owners who have become
great just by petrol-control, their power and prestige will fall
down.</p><p>In Japan they have invented a railway which can go four hundred miles
per minute. Japan does not have that much land, it can have only two
stations: beginning and the end. And at that speed the train does not
need rails, it rises four feet high, and you will be feeling just the
same as you are in an airplane. But this railway, if the world is one,
then only can be applicable. Right now, so much investment in railways
by the governments, or by vast corporations, will be destroyed.</p><p>So the public and its interest is not in the eyes of the politicians.
They don't think of humanity, they think only of their interest -- how
to climb more and more and become powerful. And they can become more
powerful only if the rich people go on contributing them. If the rich
people begin to dissolve with new inventions, the party that was
supported by them will fall out of power.These complications making the
whole life of man a misery.</p><p>In Soviet Union they have found thirty years before, kirlian
photography. But its vast potential has not been used -- not even Soviet
Union -- in minor scale, because it can give you six months before what
kind of disease is growing in you. You may not feel it. The photograph
shows because we are containing a certain electricity, and that
electricity makes an aura. The healthy man has a</p><p>bigger aura, the sick man has a very small aura, the dying man's aura
has disappeared. So if you are going to be sick in a certain part of the
body, it will lose its aura. It may become known to you when the disease
has already happened.</p><p>No country is using kirlian photography. Every hospital should use
it, but the doctors are afraid. That means no sick people, no ill people
will be coming to the hospitals. Only once in China, under the influence
of a great man, Confucius, a strange idea was accepted, and that was,
that the doctor should be paid for the health, not for curing, but for
preventing.</p><p>And the government is for the people, should not be just a slogan.
Government should pay that the man goes every month for checkup, and if
any disease is coming six month afterwards, can be prevented right now.
The man can live his whole life without any sickness. And if a man can
live for hundred years without sickness, the calculation of the
scientist is that the possibility becomes more. Three hundred years is
very easily possible, and he will remain young., he will not become
old.</p><p>Even today, a part of Kashmir that Pakistan has occupied, people live
one hundred, one hundred-twenty, without any problem. Poor people. And
in Soviet Union, a part in Caucasus, people have been found working in
the fields just like young people, and their age is one hundred-eighty.
But nobody is interested to inquire their food, what they are eating,
what kind of climate they are living. And that can become universal.
There is no need of so many hospitals and so many medicines. But the
vested interests of millions of doctors around the world, medical
colleges, will lose all its greatness.</p><p>VEDANT: WHAT IN YOUR VIEW, SHOULD BE GOVERNMENT'S FINANCIAL POLICY?
WILL YOU PLEASE SAY SOMETHING ABOUT PUBLIC VERSUS PRIVATE
ENTERPRISE?</p><p><br></p><p>Osho: I will not support government enterprise, because that makes
the government more powerful over people. And I will not support
individual enterprise, because that creates few people very rich and
millions of people very poor.</p><p>My suggestion is, everything should be a commune enterprise. They
cannot exploit because whom they are going to exploit? Themselves? And
that's what socialism is: a commune enterprise.</p><p>A simple fact, but neither the government is willing to give powers
decentralized from the federal government, and of course individuals who
are great owners... It is a conspiracy, perhaps unknown. It seems that
millions of starving people does not matter, only those ten people
matter who are the richest. And they give to the government to take more
licenses and to support the party.</p><p>Every power should be decentralized. The central government should be
only a coordinator. The states in the government should have the real
power, not the</p><p>central government. But no federal government will be ripe... agree
for it, because they lose everything.</p><p>Nobody is interested in the human bliss, human peace. Everybody is
interested how much money you have gathered. And then it does not matter
whether that money is gathered with a right means or wrong means. If you
are supporting a party who is in party, then you can go on collecting
money through wrong means.</p><p>The drug mafias have more money than anybody else. Every government
is afraid of them, so they catch poor people who have become addicted to
the drug. But it is a vast gang around the world. They remain
prestigious, high. They don't be blamed, because if you blame them their
support for the government stops.</p><p>So it is not only complex, but very contradictory. The government
catches hold of the addicts and forces them into jail, and the people
who are real culprits are respected by the presidents and the prime
ministers. So they take their money and they talk about destroying
corruption. If corruption is destroyed, many so- called great leaders
will fall down dead. And these are the leaders who are talking
continuously against corruption, but they are living on corruption. The
money that they are getting is black money.</p><p>I am not a politician, that's why I can see clearly the whole
pattern. And it is very difficult to change the pattern, the pattern is
so vast. It will be a miracle if people can start seeing that they are
destroying themselves. But they will have to see, otherwise, as many
planets, million of stars are without any life, this earth will also
become dead. It is dying.</p><p>Nepal has sold its forests for thirty years to Soviet Union.
Whatsoever they want in thirty year time they can cut. And that is
creating floods in Bangladesh. Bangladesh is poor already. This time the
flood was so big that seventy-five percent of Bangladesh was filled with
the water, thousand of people died, thousands of houses disappeared. And
you cannot blame Nepal either, because they are perhaps the poorest
country in the world, and they have nothing to sell except trees. If
they don't sell trees, they cannot remain alive.</p><p>So my proposition is, that unless a world government is there, and
national governments become only members of the world government...
every country's president becomes the member of the world government,
and thinks not only in terms of his own limited area, but the whole
complex, no problem can be solved.</p><p><br></p><p>VEDANT: WHAT WILL BE YOUR VIEW ABOUT CORRUPTION, BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE
HAVING A CONTROVERSY ABOUT BOFORS GUN DEAL IN WHICH THE MIDDLE MAN TOOK
AWAY LOT OF MONEY. SO THE QUESTION WAS, SHOULD THERE BE A MIDDLE MAN IN
THE DEFENSE PURCHASES? AND WHAT SHOULD BE THE FOREIGN POLICY OF
INDIA?</p><p>Osho: Looking at the whole complex, corruption cannot be stopped
whether there is a middle man or not. If the world is one, war becomes
impossible. With</p><p>whom you are going to fight? And there is no need for defense
departments, purchasing through middle men weapons or anything. A single
solution is a world government. Corruption will disappear, because the
world government will look at the whole area.</p><p>If people are paid just to survive, they cannot even laugh, then they
cannot be stopped from taking bribery.</p><p>A more human attitude will be that those who are taking corruption
they should be used, not condemned. But the governments go on talking
about destroying about corruption, and they themselves are supported by
the corrupted people. So they cannot do. Promises and promises... And no
promise is ever fulfilled.</p><p>So I don't believe in nationalism, and I don't believe in any
religion. I believe in the individual and his happiness.</p><p>There are sixty (?) million Catholics. And ordinarily a man coming to
the highest post of being a pope, a direct line with God... It is a vast
country -- sixty million people. And every church has to contribute
money to the Vatican. Those who bring more money to the Vatican start
rising up. They become, from priests, bishops; bishops become a higher
post... this hierarchy. So the man by the time he reaches to be a
pope... in these eighteen hundred years the pope has not survived more
than two years; he dies. By the time he reaches eighty he has
already...</p><p>Now this time it has become difficult. The pope is a Polack and he
has forgotten to die. And he is selected by the bishops, so he has
changed thousands of bishops. He has put his own men. And now the pope
has also become a problem like a president or a prime minister. But he
is preparing that if any conflict arises, his bishops are in majority,
and his order is not his order, it is coming directly from God.</p><p>Corruption will continue if there is too much hierarchy and too much
poverty. And nobody can blame them. I have only compassion for them. A
man wants to get his daughter to be married, he has to sell his land or
his house for the dowry. And the man who is accepting it, you cannot
condemn him either, because he has sold his land, he has worked hard for
his boy to grow and educated.</p><p>So it is so interlinked that you cannot solve one problem separately.
All the problems has to be taken as a inter-net, and only a world
government can change it. Once the world government is there, no army is
needed, no navy is needed, no air force is needed for fighting purposes.
They all become usable. And all this energy that is wasted in the army
and armament... Even poorest countries are wasting their money --
seventy percent of their income -- into arms. They may not have bread,
but they want atomic bomb and plants.</p><p>India itself is growing fast in population. The government cannot
enforce birth control and hide its face. In the name of democracy, how
you can enforce?</p><p>When the country became forty years before independent, it has only
fifty million people. And now it is coming close to one billion --
almost doubled. And</p><p>for the first time within ten years India will be the most populated
country. Up to now, China had that post.</p><p>But you cannot support these people. The earth is poor. You have
exploited the earth for thousands of years, and you have not nourished
it, you have not put nourishment for earth -- manure, chemicals. And
every source is limited.</p><p>My vision is not of a nationalism.</p><p>And I hate dictatorship, hiding behind any name. Sometimes it is
"emergency", and I could not see what emergency was there. Sometimes...
Now it is national defense. But who is...? And this creates problem --
anything that goes against your own constitution. In the constitution
you are very beautiful and flowery. But in practice, if you want
totalitarian power, you can make an parliament act, a defense act which
is not under the law of the land. A man can be forced into jail. He
cannot appeal, and he may not be even said why you are arrested.</p><p>Nations should disappear. With them almost ninety percent problems
will disappear. And the ten percent can be managed to disappear, they
will not be so big.</p><p>Humanity can live as beautifully as birds are living. No bird is rich
and no bird is poor. Even birds have a classless society, and man cannot
have it. It is simply idiotic.</p><p>(End side B, tape 1)</p><p><br></p><p>VEDANT: I HAD ELEVEN QUESTIONS, I HAVE ALREADY ASKED SEVEN. IS IT
OKAY? SHALL I CONTINUE FOR THE LAST...?</p><p><br></p><p>Osho: You continue.</p><p><br></p><p>VEDANT: THERE IS THIS ISSUE OF SECULARISM, AND THERE IS A GREAT
CONTROVERSY GOING ON RIGHT NOW WITH REGARD TO WHAT THEY CALL "RAM
GENERAL BUMI AND THE BABRI MASJID IN AYODHYA." BOTH COMMUNITIES, HINDUS
AND MOSLEMS, ARE CLAIMING THAT PLACE. HOW CAN THIS ISSUE BE DEFUSED?</p><p>Osho: There is no problem of...</p><p>These are politicians behind the problems. Otherwise both can worship
the place, both can make it holy. It becomes double holy to Hindus and
to Mohammedans. What is the problem?</p><p>Israel is a holy land for the Christians because of Jesus was born
there, crucified there. It is holy land for the Jew because Moses
founded the country. It is holy for Mohammedans because when Mohammed
went to heaven, riding on his horse, he stayed for rest on a rock in
Israel. So that rock is a problem. And I don't see any problem. All can
worship a rock. Rock will not say, "No, you cannot worship."</p><p>Just it has to be made clear to them that the whole earth is holy.
And if you think this part is holy for you, you should be happy that
this part is also holy for Hindus, for Mohammedans. You should invite
Christians, Jainas, to make it more holy.</p><p>Sheer childishness to fight on these problems, but politicians have
power only if there is some fight going on.</p><p>Now the government will be in difficulty. If the government sides
with the Hindus, the whole Mohammedan community will go against in the
elections. If they side with the Mohammedans, the whole Hindu community
will go against. So they just talk about it, in the parliament discuss
about it and nothing happens, and nothing will happen.</p><p>My suggestion is very simple. A holy land is nobody's possession,
anybody can worship. And more people worship it, more humanitarian it
becomes.</p><p>VEDANT: WOMEN STILL FEEL SECOND-RATE CITIZENS. THEY FEEL INSECURE AND
DISCRIMINATED. HOW SHOULD WOMEN COPE UP WITH THIS SITUATION? AND WHAT
KIND OF LEGAL SYSTEM BE CREATED TO PROTECT THEIR INTERESTS?</p><p><br></p><p>Osho: Again, as I told you, all these problems are interlinked.
Mohammed allowed four wives and created a trouble, because if a man
marries four wives then three men will remain unmarried. That will bring
prostitution.</p><p>Unless these superstitions dissolve, nothing can be done. The first
thing is to understand the problem. The problem is interlinked with
other problems.</p><p>Hindus had followed MANUSMRITI for five thousand years. Manusmriti
does not give equality to women with men. She is a second-class
citizen.</p><p>In China it went even further. A man can kill his wife, will not be
punished because it is his wife -- possession. If you destroy your chair
you cannot be punished for it.</p><p>And all religions, without any exception, have prevented women to be
educated, prevented women to move in society, meet with other people.
They have confined them in a corner in the house. No education... where
they can go? What they can do? No skill...</p><p>The problem can be solved. Women should be allowed education, given
priority to men. Women should be allowed in all the posts and
businesses. They should be freed from the burden of children. And now
birth control is possible.</p><p>Birth control is the great revolution, if understood it. Birth
control will make women and men equal. The pill was a birth control
measure, but sometimes the woman may forget the pill one day. And people
always think it is not going to happen always, but sometimes it happens.
But now they have come with a pill for the man. If the woman does not
take the pill, no problem. The man can take the pill. And even more
revolutionary pill has come which the woman can take</p><p>after making love. No need to take it the whole month or three weeks,
and no worry about it. She can take afterwards.</p><p>These pills and methods destroy the inequality. Otherwise, the women
has been continuously burdened with pregnancy, Otherwise, how twelve and
fifteen children can be born to one couple? Rabindranath was the twelfth
child. His mother must have been continuously pregnant. A woman
continuously pregnant cannot work, cannot go to the educations
institutions, cannot do business.</p><p>So the first thing is, the woman should be freed, and birth
control... Pope is against it because that brings orphans, that brings
more Catholics.</p><p>Mother Teresa is rewarded everywhere, given a Nobel Prize. Even the
Indian government has rewarded her. And what she has done? She is done
only one thing. Poor people will leave their child by the side of the
road in Calcutta, the most populated city in India, and they collect
those children. They feed them not only food, but the Bible also.
Because she brings so many Catholics, even pope comes to her place. The
respect for her by the pope is understandable. But why the Indian
government?</p><p>Indian government is giving her prestige to capture the votes of the
Christians. Birth control, free pills, should be provided to everyone
who comes. One thing, that the population comes down. By the time of two
thousand... twenty thousand... there will be more than five billion
people. And it is a phenomenon that each year the population doubles. So
nobody sees that the real problem where it is.</p><p>No child should be initiated into any religion until he is adult, and
then too, he should not be forced of persuaded. He should be educated,
supported. And to be independent he should learn some craft so he need
not be a servant.</p><p>I don't see that these problems are real problems. And if these are
the real problems, then they cannot be solved. These are created
problems. It gives power to both.</p><p>When Ayatollah Khomeini ordered the murder of a novelist, Rushdie,
who has done nothing... He is a Mohammedan, and what he has written is
factual, but to bring Christ to a... any reference to Koran into a novel
is degrading the Koran, it is holy. And nobody condemned Ayatollah
Khomeini. On the contrary, everybody supported him except me. And when I
condemned him on this issue, some Hindu wrote a letter to the government
of India, that what Khomeini is doing with Rushdie, I have done thousand
times more -- criticism of Krishna and Rama and Buddha -- the same
should be the case: 'he should be murdered.'</p><p>This is not a human society. Civilization has not happened.</p><p>According to me, all problems are fabulous. Now this is stupid. You
say heaven is above. For the argument's sake we accept that Mohammed
went with his horse, but where Israel came in? Israel is not above
earth, that he rested there... Just fictions</p><p>Our misery is that we believe in fictions, and if anybody points to
the fictions he becomes target of the collective masses, which know
nothing about... In the first</p><p>place nobody can fly with the horse. In the second place, Israel does
not come in the way. And these kinds of things in Hinduism, in Jainism,
everywhere they are.</p><p>So no children should be converted into any religion by the parents
if the parents really love the child. Whether the child is boy or girl,
they should be given equal opportunity to grow, equal education, equal
freedom to move and express. And they should not be forced to go against
nature. There will be no problem. The problem arises when you go against
nature.</p><p>Manu has made the caste system, which is a ugliest thing. One-fourth
of Hindus are not even second-rate citizens, they are almost animal. And
the woman will be free only if there is no marriage bondage and equal
opportunity. She can love somebody, she can be with somebody, this is
not against nature. And once your love is finished... That too is a
fiction, that love is eternal, it never finishes. Once you have loved
somebody -- if it is real love, that is the criterion -- that it will
remain the same to the last breath. Nothing remains the same even the
second after. Soon you become fed-up with each other. And because the
man has all the money, all the education, all the power, naturally he
represses the woman.</p><p>Woman has found her own ways to nag him, to throw pillows at him, but
this does not make any change.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard a story... In a neighborhood from every apartment --
because the walls are becoming thinner and thinner, you can hear
everything that is going on in other flats. Everybody there constant
fight, but there was a wonder. One Sardar also lived in the same
building, but nothing was heard. Finally, all other husbands approached
them and asked him, "What is the matter? We never see you sad or
miserable, no fight, and the same is with your wife. You are a perfect
couple. But we want to know what is the secret."</p><p>The Sardar laughed. He said, "It is better you should not ask. We
both are happy. I am happy when she throws a thing at me and I move, and
the thing thrown at me does not hit me. I laugh. When she throws a thing
it hurts me, she laughs."</p><p>So the neighborhood was worried that they both laugh. What kind of
people these are? Only laughter is heard.</p><p>But this is going on all over the world.</p><p>To change the status of woman and bring her to the same as man, you
will have to begin with the child. Don't teach him anything concerning
religion, politics. Teach him something beautiful -- painting, growing a
rosebush. Don't talk about stupid things like brahmacharya, celibacy.
There has never been a celibate in the world; it is unnatural. You are
making him a hypocrite. Because of this celibacy man's hypocrisy can
remain hidden, but the woman's menstrual period cannot remain hidden. On
this point Mahavira decided that a woman can attain to enlightenment,
but not from the body of a woman. First she will have to attain the body
of man. Only man can go to moksha, because the woman cannot be
celibate.</p><p>But recent search is that just as the woman has three or four days'
menstrual period, man also has.</p><p>Celibacy is not possible. You can make it hide, but it is there.</p><p>The woman is certain an immense problem, because it is half of the
humanity. And if half of the humanity remains subdued, life becomes
unbalanced, laughter disappears, a sadness, a burden, an anguish,
anxiety -- that takes place of a joyful, laughing and dancing life. But
it can be changed very easily.</p><p>I don't see any problem that cannot be changed. But the problems are
such that the politicians are living on them. If those problems are
solved, the politician is gone and all his power is gone. So he teaches
and preaches, but his practice is different.</p><p>Simple things have become very complex, and we should take the
responsibility. And if intelligent and responsible people understand
that we cannot go against nature, many problems will dissolve.</p><p>Because of celibacy, homosexuality is born. It is a great
contribution of the religions to make monasteries and monks. One of the
most ancient monastery and very prestigious -- Ethos -- has at least
three thousand monks in it. A monk enters the monastery, then he cannot
get out. He gets out when he is dead. A woman is not allowed -- not even
six-month baby. No woman has entered in Ethos for one thousand years,
naturally, homosexuality.</p><p>And homosexuality has created a great problem, AIDS. These are the
contributions of religions. Now AIDS is the end of the road, there is no
cure. No scientists thinks that there will be any cure. And it is
spreading like wildfire and nobody is doing anything.</p><p>You will be surprised that twenty-one countries has passed laws that
I should not be allowed in any case in their country. The reason? I have
been expelled from Greece, I had only four weeks' visa, but the Catholic
archpriest went on forcing the government that I should be thrown out,
"otherwise he will destroy our religion, he will destroy our piousness.
He is a most dangerous man." And the president who forced me -- because
he cannot deport, I had not committed any crime -- to leave under threat
by the priest, that "If you don't force him to leave, we will dynamite
the house in which he is staying on the seashore with his twenty-five
friends."</p><p>And just now, the president is hammered from every side because he
has found a girlfriend. The wife is there and she is not divorced --
there is no question of divorce in Greek Orthodox Christianity. Thinking
that he is a president, he even started coming to the parliament with
his girlfriend. But he was wrong. The whole country is against now, he
cannot be again selected. And this man forced me out without thinking
for a moment that a religion which has existed for two thousand years
cannot be destroyed by two weeks by a man. And if it can be destroyed by
a man in two weeks, it is worth destroying.</p><p>VEDANT: I HAVE ONLY LAST TWO QUESTIONS, OSHO.</p><p>(LITTLE CONVERSATION BETWEEN VEDANT AND OSHO)</p><p>IN VIEW OF THIS COMING ELECTIONS, WHAT IN YOUR VIEW SHOULD BE AN
IDEAL CABINET? AND WHO, IN YOUR VIEW, IS THE IDEAL PRIME MINISTER? AND I
WILL JUST ADD THE LAST QUESTION TO THIS.</p><p>FOUR YEARS AGO WHEN PRITISH NANDY HAD INTERVIEWED YOU BACK AT THE
RANCH, YOU HAD SAID AT THAT TIME THAT RAJIV GANDHI SHOULD GO BACK AN
BECOME A PILOT, AND THERE WAS A BIG UPROAR. NOW FOUR YEARS LATER, DO YOU
THINK RAJIV GANDHI IS FIT ENOUGH TO RIDE A BICYCLE?</p><p>Osho: No.Â I will not say that he should go to ride a bicycle. He has
lost every respectability. He has not done anything that he promised to
the country. He has promised that the country he will lead into
twenty-one century. And he is leading the country towards a suicide. He
has not done anything to prevent the population. He has promised he will
destroy corruption. He has not done anything to destroy or stop. All his
promises have been false. Now I will not trust that he can be a
pilot.</p><p>And as far as the cabinet ministers, I am not acquainted with any
politicians, so I cannot say who can be the right prime minister. The
difficulty is, a man without power is one thing. The same man with power
is altogether different. So you know a man only when he has power.
Without power everybody is a saint.</p><p>Okay...</p></div></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2024 <a href=https://osho.lol/>Osho - The complete works of Osho</a></span> Â·

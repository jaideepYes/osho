The first: love grows only in deep intimacy and trust. If you change persons, from A to B, from B to C, it is as if you are transplanting your being from one place to another. You will never grow roots. And the tree will grow fragile and weak. To gain strength, deep roots are needed; and to gain roots, time is needed. And for love even eternity is not enough. Even eternity is not enough, remember, because love can grow and grow and grow – and there is no end to it. There is a beginning, but there is no end.\nSo don’t take love as a superficial thing. It is not just a relationship. Through love, your whole being has to be discovered. It is sacred, but in the West it has become very profane; it has almost lost the meaning. It has become more and more sexual and bodily, very superficial and casual. In fact I am afraid that the West may lose the very dimension of love. People may completely forget that there was a possibility of inner endless growth in it.\nIf it is a question of excitement, then it is good to change partners. Then you are more excited and your partner is something to discover. With an old partner everything is known and settled; the whole territory is known. One starts feeling a little fed up, a little bored. This is natural. But if you love the person, you love even the boredom. If you love the person, you also love even his old habits, the old ways, the old territory. Old things have a charm of their own, mm? Just the old armchair you sit on – it has something that no other chair can give, it fits perfectly. Not only that you know it, it also knows you.\nThere is a familiarity in the old room in which you have lived, the old house. there is a certain affinity, a certain tuning, so that by and by you are not two separate things. You have melted into each other\nand have become one, and the boundaries have become blurred. With new things, boundaries are very shy and the separation is very clear. Old things have their charm, but one has to discover it.\nOnly children are interested in new things. The more grown up you are, the more interested you are in the old things, and the less one is bored. Then you go on finding that these are just levels, layers; that when you love a person one layer has been known – but don’t conclude that that is all. A deeper layer is waiting to be provoked and challenged – and there is no end to it. In fact the person himself is not aware how many layers of being he has. If a lover challenges his being, not only the lover will know, the person himself will come to know his being – and only through love. we come to know each other when we challenge each other, and go on provoking each other.\nSo try to find out new was with the old person – and you will never be at a loss. Once you know the key of how to always discover a new layer, then the old person is never old. Or, he is old and yet new. then you are not bored or fed up. then by and by roots grow.\nA point comes in deep love where the lover and the beloved almost become one. I say almost, because the bodies remain separate; but they come to feel a harmony. Now even new research shows that if two persons have loved each other very long, they need not say anything to each other. If a thought arises in one person, it is immediately transferred to the other. Old lovers don’t say much but they understand. By and by lovers become twins, mm?\nSo love is a great adventure, it is not a casual thing. It is a life commitment – and if you can understand, it is a commitment for lives, not only for one life.\nBecause of Christianity and Judaism and Mohammedanism – and these three religions have become very important in the West – the concept of rebirth has been lost. But if you love a person very deeply in this life, you will find him in the next life again. There are recorded phenomena about the same couple being born again and again for many lives, going on discovering each other.\nSo let love be your meditation. Make it a sacred thing, not a casual phenomenon. Let it be a challenge. Each challenge is painful because each growth is painful. So for six months you have to make love your meditation. Forget that anybody else exists except your lover. And see what happens in these six months.\nIf someday some idea arises about somebody – because mind goes on thinking; it is a betrayal of the inner spirit, it is a renegade, a Judas – don’t repress it, because repression is not going to help. Each night, whenever you have any desire, any erotic desire arising, for half an hour close the eyes and let that desire have full play in fantasy. Whatsoever you want to do, do in fantasy. Don’t condemn it; it is natural, just human. Devote that half hour completely to it so that it is finished with.\nSoon you will start seeing the whole game of the mind, and within six months all ideas of other persons will disappear from the mind. And when that happens, for the first time you will know what love is. Up to now you have only heard the word, mm? So six months. And then every month you go on reporting how things are going. Good, Anupama.\n[A sannyasin says she has a tension like a ‘greed for God’ and cannot accept her stupidity.]\nNothing is to be done. They are needed, they are fun! If you are not stupid at all and you become completely wise, life will be too burdened. A little foolishness is good so that one can enjoy also. And every great man... it is not that he has dropped foolishness, he has used it. He has transformed it into his wisdom.\nNothing has to be dropped and nothing has to be cut away, otherwise you will always remain a fragment, you will never be whole. That stupid pa] t is also you. And who is condemning it? It is the ego. In fact the stupid part is more natural than this ego which goes on condemning and saying that this part is stupid and to drop it.\nDon’t be serious – there is no need, no need. And whether you accept yourself or not, you are you. Your rejection doesn’t make any change. It only makes you miserable, that’s all. If you accept, you can dance and be happy and celebrating. If you don’t accept, you become serious and tense. So the real question is not whether to accept or not, but whether you want to be happy or unhappy.\nOnce Diogenes, who had become a hundred years old, was asked by somebody why he was always happy and what was his secret. He said, ‘Every morning when I get up I have two alternatives – to be happy or not to be happy. I always choose to be happy!’\nWhat is the point in being miserable! And this is the most important thing: if you are happy you start changing. Happiness is the only alchemy in the world. It is the only secret of transformation; there is no other. Unhappy people never change, and because they don’t change they become more unhappy.\nHappy people continuously change, and because they change they become more and more happy; and then more and more change is possible. Why do I say that happiness is the only alchemy? It is because in happiness you are flowing, your energy is not frozen; it is not blocked. You have an inner dance of energy, a dynamic energy, that is needed for transformation. When you are unhappy you are dull, solid, rock-like; nothing is flowing, everything is frozen. How can you change?\nSo don’t be serious! This is one of the pitfalls for people who are searching for God. People who are searching for God are almost always serious people. Non-serious people don’t get interested in God – and they are the right persons to find Him! They are so much involved in life, in love, in enjoying small things – ‘eat, drink, be merry’ – they are moving in the world, mm? They don’t go to the temple or to church – it seems too serious and seems to belong to death and not to life.\nAnd they are the right people, the festive people, who can attain to God. But this is the misfortune – that they never become interested. The people who become interested are always depressed, sad, blocked. They are people who have missed their lives somehow: egoists, moralists, puritans, all sorts of ill people. They get into the church, and because of them God cannot enter the church. I can understand God’s difficulty, because what can you do with serious people – they will kill you!\nGod is where life is, where the dance is still happening and the flowers blossoming, the rivers flowing, and the world of stars. He is there – in life. God is life. You can forget the word ‘god’ and nothing will be lost – ‘life’ is enough. And when I say ‘life’ I don’t mean life with a capital ‘L’, no; just a lower case ‘l’ will do. Just a simple life, not even with a capital L. That life is God.\nSo this is a problem, and this is the problem I have to face every day. I would like you to be happy and merry and cheerful. I would like you to be madly in love with life, because that is the only way one knows what God is. When you are lost in love and life, you have found Him. When you are too serious in the mind, and after Him too much, you can go on chasing Him but you will never find Him – because you are not the right person. He will not want to meet you. (Radha laughs) Your company will be too serious.\nGod has always been avoiding the saints, and He has done well to avoid them. So don’t be a saint! Even if you are a sinner it is okay. But be happy, because a happy man cannot sin. By and by the happiness transforms. You may be a saint, but if you are unhappy you are already committing the greatest sin that one can commit – the sin of being unhappy. A person who is unhappy will tend to make others unhappy. You can give to others only that which you have.\nSo drop all this nonsense! If you want to be religious, drop all religion. And if you want some day to know what God is, forget all about Him – life is enough. Be more festive, mm? And there is nothing to it – just a simple understanding. So start being happy from this very moment, right? (Radha smiled tentatively)\nAnd that is why I am not allowing you into the ashram yet. When I see that you are really dancing and happy I will allow you, otherwise you will have to wait outside the gate a little longer, mm? You know that is the barrier – because I am afraid of serious people. (Osho laughed with the group.) They can come and destroy the whole thing that I am trying to create.\nI don’t think that you are naturally a serious person. There are people who are born ill, who are born serious. It is very difficult for them to drop it. But for you, I don’t see any problem. You can simply get out of it as one gets out of the clothes, that’s all. You be yourself, and don’t bother with seriousness. Good, Radha. From this very moment, mm?\n[A sannyasin asked Osho about the nature of epilepsy, from which she had been suffering for several years. She only had attacks – and only of two minutes duration – when she was asleep.\nShe added that the fits left her feeling rather strange and empty]\n... don’t be worried; it will disappear by and by. There is nothing wrong in it. Try and make it a meditation. Just do one thing: every night when you go to sleep, just repeat three times that whenever it is going to happen, it will be tremendously peaceful and silent and blissful. That’s all. And next time when it happens, something of meditation will have entered into it and there will be a change. Epileptic fits and ecstatic fits are similar: the mechanism is the same, only the quality is different.\nRamkrishna used to have fits. Doctors diagnosed that they were epileptic and that he was going insane. Had he been in the West he would have immediately been given electric shocks and been put into a mental asylum. You have the fit for only two minutes. He used to sometimes have a fit for six hours, and once he remained unconscious for eighteen hours.\nIn India we know that the symptom is the same as in epilepsy, but that the person is only unconscious in the body – deep inside the consciousness is there and he is perfectly peaceful.\nNext time it happens you will have a very ecstatic and blissful experience – deep silence and calm. And those two minutes will give you a tremendous insight into your being.\nBut use the same words every night and in the same order, so the mind doesn’t get confused. Next time it will be beautiful, it will not be a disease anymore, mm?\n[A sannyasin who runs a centre in the West says he is always being told to cut his hair] Mm, don’t cut it.\n[The center leader adds: ... when I work in the centre, I often feel difficulties both working and meditating... I work much]\nNo, you work much. Working is never bad, and one can never work too much, never. We never work too much.\n... We never work as much as we can, we never work to the maximum potential. In fact, at the most, people work fifteen percent of their potential – and those are the very hard workers.\nAs I see it, you are not working more than seven or eight percent. The more you work, the more you are capable of working. The less you work, the less you become capable of working. Life has its own logic.\nJesus says,‘If you have, more will be given to you. If you don’t have, even that which you have will be taken away from you.’ If you work hard you will get more energy. If you don’t work hard, if you don’t work at all and you avoid it, even the energy that you have will disappear. So whatsoever you want to do, do it, and do it to the optimum. And soon you will see that more and more doors are opening, and more energy becomes available.\nAlways try to reach more than you can grasp; always try to reach beyond your grasp. That is how one grows. If you always try that which you can do, you will always fall flat on the earth – you will not he growing. Try the impossible and it becomes possible. And if you don’t try the possible, even that will become impossible.\nThere is a time to work, a certain age limit where you can work hard. If you have worked hard at that age, in your remaining life the glow of work remains with you. If you miss that time, then you miss the glow. Then you simply repent that you missed the time when you could have worked hard. People who have been really working have a different type of energy in their old age – a glow, something, as if a light is burning inside. They may not be working then, but you know that they have earned a rest and now they can relax. Relaxation has to be earned.\nSo do whatsoever you can do right now, because right now you have energy, mm?\n[The center leader answers: I find it difficult to work and meditate each day. I find it easier to work a lot, then spend some time meditating.]\nYou don’t understand the mechanism. In fact, one should continuously change, because the brain has many centres.\nFor example, if you do mathematics, then a certain part of the brain functions and the other parts rest. Then you read poetry: then that part that was functioning in mathematics rests and another part starts functioning.\nThat’s why in universities and schools we change periods – forty minutes, forty-five minutes – because each centre of the brain has a capacity to function for forty minutes. Then it feels tired and needs a rest, and the best rest is to change the work – so that some other centre starts working and one relaxes. So continuous change is very very good; it enriches you.\nI understand the difficultyYou do a thing and the mind becomes obsessed, you go mad after it.\nBut that’s bad; one should not become so possessed. while doing it, become absorbed, but always remain a master; otherwise you will become a slave. and slavery is not good. Even slavery to God, to meditation, is not good. If you can’t stop doing a certain thing, or you only stop very reluctantly, that simply shows that you don’t know how to change gears in the mind.\nSo do one thing:: whenever you are doing something.for example, you are meditating and now\nyou want to do something else. then after you stop meditating for five minutes simply exhale deeply, as possible. Then let the body inhale, don’t you inhale. Have a feeling that you are throwing out everything that was in the mind and in the body and in the system. Just five minutes, then start doing some other work, and immediately you will feel you have changed.\nYou need the neutral gear for five minutes, mm? If you change gear in a car, the gear has to first move to neutral – even if just for a single moment, but it has to move. The more efficient the driver, the faster he can move from neutral. So give five minutes to the neutral gear. You are not working at anything – just breathing, just being. Then by and by you go on dropping: after one month, four minutes; after two months, three minutes.\nThen by and by there will come a point where just one exhalation is enough and you are finished with the work – closed, a full stop – and then you start other work. You try this, and next time you come you will be perfectly okay.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"3273","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/hammer_on_the_rock/part3/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/hammer_on_the_rock/>Hammer on the Rock</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">3</h1><div class=post-meta>16 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3273 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Hammer_on_the_Rock/part3.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part2>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

other. If a thought arises in one person, it is immediately transferred
to the other. Old lovers don’t say much but they understand. By and by
lovers become twins, mm?</p><p><br></p><p>So love is a great adventure, it is not a casual thing. It is a life
commitment – and if you can understand, it is a commitment for lives,
not only for one life.</p><p><br></p><p>Because of Christianity and Judaism and Mohammedanism – and these
three religions have become very important in the West – the concept of
rebirth has been lost. But if you love a person very deeply in this
life, you will find him in the next life again. There are recorded
phenomena about the same couple being born again and again for many
lives, going on discovering each other.</p><p><br></p><p>So let love be your meditation. Make it a sacred thing, not a casual
phenomenon. Let it be a challenge. Each challenge is painful because
each growth is painful. So for six months you have to make love your
meditation. Forget that anybody else exists except your lover. And see
what happens in these six months.</p><p><br></p><p>If someday some idea arises about somebody – because mind goes on
thinking; it is a betrayal of the inner spirit, it is a renegade, a
Judas – don’t repress it, because repression is not going to help. Each
night, whenever you have any desire, any erotic desire arising, for half
an hour close the eyes and let that desire have full play in fantasy.
Whatsoever you want to do, do in fantasy. Don’t condemn it; it is
natural, just human. Devote that half hour completely to it so that it
is finished with.</p><p><br></p><p>Soon you will start seeing the whole game of the mind, and within six
months all ideas of other persons will disappear from the mind. And when
that happens, for the first time you will know what love is. Up to now
you have only heard the word, mm? So six months. And then every month
you go on reporting how things are going. Good, Anupama.</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin says she has a tension like a ‘greed for God’ and cannot
accept her stupidity.]</p><p>Nothing is to be done. They are needed, they are fun! If you are not
stupid at all and you become completely wise, life will be too burdened.
A little foolishness is good so that one can enjoy also. And every great
man... it is not that he has dropped foolishness, he has used it. He has
transformed it into his wisdom.</p><p><br></p><p>Nothing has to be dropped and nothing has to be cut away, otherwise
you will always remain a fragment, you will never be whole. That stupid
pa] t is also you. And who is condemning it? It is the ego. In fact the
stupid part is more natural than this ego which goes on condemning and
saying that this part is stupid and to drop it.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t be serious – there is no need, no need. And whether you accept
yourself or not, you are you. Your rejection doesn’t make any change. It
only makes you miserable, that’s all. If you accept, you can dance and
be happy and celebrating. If you don’t accept, you become serious and
tense. So the real question is not whether to accept or not, but whether
you want to be happy or unhappy.</p><p><br></p><p>Once Diogenes, who had become a hundred years old, was asked by
somebody why he was always happy and what was his secret. He said,
‘Every morning when I get up I have two alternatives – to be happy or
not to be happy. I always choose to be happy!’</p><p><br></p><p>What is the point in being miserable! And this is the most important
thing: if you are happy you start changing. Happiness is the only
alchemy in the world. It is the only secret of transformation; there is
no other. Unhappy people never change, and because they don’t change
they become more unhappy.</p><p><br></p><p>Happy people continuously change, and because they change they become
more and more happy; and then more and more change is possible. Why do I
say that happiness is the only alchemy? It is because in happiness you
are flowing, your energy is not frozen; it is not blocked. You have an
inner dance of energy, a dynamic energy, that is needed for
transformation. When you are unhappy you are dull, solid, rock-like;
nothing is flowing, everything is frozen. How can you change?</p><p><br></p><p>So don’t be serious! This is one of the pitfalls for people who are
searching for God. People who are searching for God are almost always
serious people. Non-serious people don’t get interested in God – and
they are the right persons to find Him! They are so much involved in
life, in love, in enjoying small things – ‘eat, drink, be merry’ – they
are moving in the world, mm? They don’t go to the temple or to church –
it seems too serious and seems to belong to death and not to life.</p><p><br></p><p>And they are the right people, the festive people, who can attain to
God. But this is the misfortune – that they never become interested. The
people who become interested are always depressed, sad, blocked. They
are people who have missed their lives somehow: egoists, moralists,
puritans, all sorts of ill people. They get into the church, and because
of them God cannot enter the church. I can understand God’s difficulty,
because what can you do with serious people – they will kill you!</p><p><br></p><p>God is where life is, where the dance is still happening and the
flowers blossoming, the rivers flowing, and the world of stars. He is
there – in life. God is life. You can forget the word ‘god’ and nothing
will be lost – ‘life’ is enough. And when I say ‘life’ I don’t mean life
with a capital ‘L’, no; just a lower case ‘l’ will do. Just a simple
life, not even with a capital L. That life is God.</p><p>So this is a problem, and this is the problem I have to face every
day. I would like you to be happy and merry and cheerful. I would like
you to be madly in love with life, because that is the only way one
knows what God is. When you are lost in love and life, you have found
Him. When you are too serious in the mind, and after Him too much, you
can go on chasing Him but you will never find Him – because you are not
the right person. He will not want to meet you. (Radha laughs) Your
company will be too serious.</p><p><br></p><p>God has always been avoiding the saints, and He has done well to
avoid them. So don’t be a saint! Even if you are a sinner it is okay.
But be happy, because a happy man cannot sin. By and by the happiness
transforms. You may be a saint, but if you are unhappy you are already
committing the greatest sin that one can commit – the sin of being
unhappy. A person who is unhappy will tend to make others unhappy. You
can give to others only that which you have.</p><p><br></p><p>So drop all this nonsense! If you want to be religious, drop all
religion. And if you want some day to know what God is, forget all about
Him – life is enough. Be more festive, mm? And there is nothing to it –
just a simple understanding. So start being happy from this very moment,
right? (Radha smiled tentatively)</p><p><br></p><p>And that is why I am not allowing you into the ashram yet. When I see
that you are really dancing and happy I will allow you, otherwise you
will have to wait outside the gate a little longer, mm? You know that is
the barrier – because I am afraid of serious people. (Osho laughed with
the group.) They can come and destroy the whole thing that I am trying
to create.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t think that you are naturally a serious person. There are
people who are born ill, who are born serious. It is very difficult for
them to drop it. But for you, I don’t see any problem. You can simply
get out of it as one gets out of the clothes, that’s all. You be
yourself, and don’t bother with seriousness. Good, Radha. From this very
moment, mm?</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin asked Osho about the nature of epilepsy, from which she
had been suffering for several years. She only had attacks – and only of
two minutes duration – when she was asleep.</p><p><br></p><p>She added that the fits left her feeling rather strange and
empty<span class=s4></span>]</p><p><br></p><p>... don’t be worried; it will disappear by and by. There is nothing
wrong in it. Try and make it a meditation. Just do one thing: every
night when you go to sleep, just repeat three times that whenever it is
going to happen, it will be tremendously peaceful and silent and
blissful. That’s all. And next time when it happens, something of
meditation will have entered into it and there will be a change.
Epileptic fits and ecstatic fits are similar: the mechanism is the same,
only the quality is different.</p><p><br></p><p>Ramkrishna used to have fits. Doctors diagnosed that they were
epileptic and that he was going insane. Had he been in the West he would
have immediately been given electric shocks and been put into a mental
asylum. You have the fit for only two minutes. He used to sometimes have
a fit for six hours, and once he remained unconscious for eighteen
hours.</p><p><br></p><p>In India we know that the symptom is the same as in epilepsy, but
that the person is only unconscious in the body – deep inside the
consciousness is there and he is perfectly peaceful.</p><p>Next time it happens you will have a very ecstatic and blissful
experience – deep silence and calm. And those two minutes will give you
a tremendous insight into your being.</p><p><br></p><p>But use the same words every night and in the same order, so the mind
doesn’t get confused. Next time it will be beautiful, it will not be a
disease anymore, mm?</p><p><br></p><p>[A sannyasin who runs a centre in the West says he is always being
told to cut his hair] Mm, don’t cut it.</p><p>[The center leader adds: ... when I work in the centre, I often feel
difficulties both working and meditating... I work much]</p><p><br></p><p>No, you work much. Working is never bad, and one can never work too
much, never. We never work too much.</p><p><br></p><p>... We never work as much as we can, we never work to the maximum
potential. In fact, at the most, people work fifteen percent of their
potential – and those are the very hard workers.</p><p><br></p><p>As I see it, you are not working more than seven or eight percent.
The more you work, the more you are capable of working. The less you
work, the less you become capable of working. Life has its own
logic.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus says,‘If you have, more will be given to you. If you don’t
have, even that which you have will be taken away from you.’ If you work
hard you will get more energy. If you don’t work hard, if you don’t work
at all and you avoid it, even the energy that you have will disappear.
So whatsoever you want to do, do it, and do it to the optimum. And soon
you will see that more and more doors are opening, and more energy
becomes available.</p><p><br></p><p>Always try to reach more than you can grasp; always try to reach
beyond your grasp. That is how one grows. If you always try that which
you can do, you will always fall flat on the earth – you will not he
growing. Try the impossible and it becomes possible. And if you don’t
try the possible, even that will become impossible.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a time to work, a certain age limit where you can work hard.
If you have worked hard at that age, in your remaining life the glow of
work remains with you. If you miss that time, then you miss the glow.
Then you simply repent that you missed the time when you could have
worked hard. People who have been really working have a different type
of energy in their old age – a glow, something, as if a light is burning
inside. They may not be working then, but you know that they have earned
a rest and now they can relax. Relaxation has to be earned.</p><p><br></p><p>So do whatsoever you can do right now, because right now you have
energy, mm?</p><p><br></p><p>[The center leader answers: I find it difficult to work and meditate
each day. I find it easier to work a lot, then spend some time
meditating.]</p><p><br></p><p>You don’t understand the mechanism. In fact, one should continuously
change, because the brain has many centres.</p><p>For example, if you do mathematics, then a certain part of the brain
functions and the other parts rest. Then you read poetry: then that part
that was functioning in mathematics rests and another part starts
functioning.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why in universities and schools we change periods – forty
minutes, forty-five minutes – because each centre of the brain has a
capacity to function for forty minutes. Then it feels tired and needs a
rest, and the best rest is to change the work – so that some other
centre starts working and one relaxes. So continuous change is very very
good; it enriches you.</p><p><br></p><p>I understand the difficulty<span class=s4></span>You do a thing and
the mind becomes obsessed, you go mad after it.</p><p>But that’s bad; one should not become so possessed. while doing it,
become absorbed, but always remain a master; otherwise you will become a
slave. and slavery is not good. Even slavery to God, to meditation, is
not good. If you can’t stop doing a certain thing, or you only stop very
reluctantly, that simply shows that you don’t know how to change gears
in the mind.</p><p><br></p><p>So do one thing:: whenever you are doing something.<span class=s4></span>for example, you are meditating and now</p><p>you want to do something else. then after you stop meditating for
five minutes simply exhale deeply, as possible. Then let the body
inhale, don’t you inhale. Have a feeling that you are throwing out
everything that was in the mind and in the body and in the system. Just
five minutes, then start doing some other work, and immediately you will
feel you have changed.</p><p><br></p><p>You need the neutral gear for five minutes, mm? If you change gear in
a car, the gear has to first move to neutral – even if just for a single
moment, but it has to move. The more efficient the driver, the faster he
can move from neutral. So give five minutes to the neutral gear. You are
not working at anything – just breathing, just being. Then by and by you
go on dropping: after one month, four minutes; after two months, three
minutes.</p><p><br></p><p>Then by and by there will come a point where just one exhalation is
enough and you are finished with the work – closed, a full stop – and
then you start other work. You try this, and next time you come you will
be perfectly okay.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part2>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

Not the otherwise -- not that knowledge will come first and then you will face me. Knowledge will not precede; reality will precede. Knowledge is a shadow: it follows. Once you start thinking that knowledge precedes, you are in a mess. I will tell you one story: One evening a monk knocked at the doors of a Zen monastery. He wanted to stay over for the night. He was tired, hungry. I he host opened the door, but rather than greeting him by a hello or good evening, he encountered him with a Zen koan -- very famous. He said: \"What is your original face, the face that you had before your father and mother were born? \"\nThe monk took off his sandal from his foot and hit the host hard on the face. The host stepped back, bowed down and said, \"Welcome, you are welcome. Your understanding is tremendous.\"\nThen they had dinner. In the cold night they were sitting by the fireplace chitchatting, and the guest asked, \"Have you got the answer yourself or not? The koan that you asked me -- have you got the answer of it yourself or not?\"\nThe host said, \"I am not that fortunate. No, I have not got the answer. But I recognized it when you gave me the answer. Because I have read so much about Zen, and heard so much about Zen, I could recognize the immediacy of your answer. You didn't hesitate for a single moment, you didn't think it. It came out of your totality. It was not from the head -- that much I could recognize.\"\nThe guest didn't answer. He continued sipping his tea. But then the host became a little suspicious. He looked again at the face of the guest and he found there was something he didn't like. So he asked again, \"Please, tell me: do you really know the answer? Have you got the answer? \"\nThe guest started laughing, he starting rolling on the mat in deep mirth. He said,\n\"No, sir. I have also read too much about Zen and heard too much about Zen.\"\nIf knowledge becomes too much, that becomes the barrier. You can know without knowing. That is the danger of knowledge. You can know, not knowing at all. Deep inside you remain ignorant, but on the surface you know everything that can be known.\nYou can deceive others, but the greater danger is that someday you may be deceived by yourself, you may deceive yourself. Then all possibility for growth stops.\nNever be bothered about knowledge. The whole quest should be for reality, for that which is. You should not be worried about it. That is the difference between theology and religion: theology goes on talking about God; religion TALKS God, not about. The'about' is the realm of theology. The priests, the preachers, they go on talking about and about. Religion is not talking about reality. Religion TALKS\nreality.\nYou ask me, \"Will I know when I am ready to face you?\" You will face me first; then you will know. Knowledge always follows. It is a recognition when the real thing has happened. You will not know God before knowing Him. You will know Him first and then, as a shadow, knowledge will follow. You will recognize later on what has happened. The happening is first; recognition is later.\nSometimes it may take much time to recognize, because mind is stupid.\nSometimes it may take much time to recognize. It may happen many times in your life -- you may have attained a few moments of tremendous reality, authenticity, but you couldn't recognize them. They are lost in the desert. Before you could recognize them they were gone, and then there were other things: the mind became engaged. You missed.\nThis is my observation: that you cannot find a single human being on the whole of the earth who has not had some moments of reality. In spite of yourself, sometimes the glimpse comes to you, because it is not only you who is seeking reality -- the reality is also seeking you. It is not only that you need God: God is in tremendous need of man. You cannot be without Him; He cannot be without you.\nYou can forget Him, but He cannot ever forget you. You may be standing with your back towards Him, but He goes on trying to reach you. Your hands may be very small; His hands are not small. He can reach you wherever you are, even in the seventh hell. And He goes on groping for you, remember this.\nThat's why many times -- not because of you, in spite of you -- a glimpse happens. But you cannot recognize it. Many people have religious experiences but they cannot recognize them as religious. Sometimes they are aesthetic experiences. No true aesthetic experience can be other than religious.\nWhen you see a beautiful face of a man or a woman or a child, if really you are struck by the beauty, the experience is not only aesthetic; it is religious. In that moment of beauty, God has looked at you through that face; God has revealed himself to you through that face. Through those eyes, the depth of existence has tried to communicate with the depth of your being. Depth has talked to depth, there has been a dialogue. It has not only been aesthetic.\nSuddenly one morning you are light and graceful. You are fresh and unburdened. The past is no more haunting you and the future has not yet started. You look at the sky, a vast emptiness, and everything stops within you.\nYou also become a vast emptiness. It is not just an aesthetic experience; it is religious. Beauty is truth... and truth is beautiful!\nSometimes you hear music and the mind stops. The music surrounds you, you are drowned in it. You are no more there. Just a transparent presence: the music goes through and through. In that moment, it is not only music that is happening; it is religion. But you don't recognize it.\nYou think religion happens only in the church, where dead priests go on beating around the bush? In fact, the church is the last place for religion to happen. It is a graveyard; God is not alive there. A church is full of dead gods. They were alive once, somewhere in the past. They are just histories now.\nWhen Jesus walked on earth, around him religious experiences were happening.\nBut now Jesus is a dead myth. He's worshipped in churches, preached about and about, but he's not there.\nThe church, the temple, is the last place for religion to happen, for God to\npenetrate you. He comes to you in more alive ways. He comes through the wife, through the child, through the husband, through the friend. Sometimes, even through the enemy. Flowers and ocean and sand and the mountains and the stars and the birds: He comes in a thousand and one ways, but always alive.\nHe's life; you can forget the name'God'. The word has become very dirty -- drop it! Just call Him life, that will do; call Him existence or being, that will do. If truth seems too harsh, call Him love, that will do. If truth has been too much monopolized by philosophers, drop it. Love is perfectly beautiful.\nWherever you have had any poetic experience, wherever your heart has become a.small poem -- something throbbed within you, something unknown -- there is religion. Recognition may take time. Sometimes for lives you may not be able to recognize. And when you recognize you will simply laugh, you will go mad with Laughter, because in that recognition many other things which were left unrecognized will also be recognized.\nI have heard about a Zen monk -- the story is simply unbelievable! He worked hard. His master had given him a koan, a Zen puzzle to work out. The koan was: if one hand claps, what will be the sound? Not two hands clapping with each other; just one hand clapping in emptiness. What will be the sound? Try to hear it.\nHe tried and tried, but he couldn't hear it. Years passed. He would go to the master, he would always bring something that he had heard, and the master would reject it immediately. Even before he had said anything, the master would say, \"No! Don't bring any.stupidity here. Go back. Work hard.\"\nIt is said that twelve years passed and the master never even gave an appreciative look. He was harsh and the disciple lost his heart, he lost his nerve.\nHe escaped from the monastery.\nWhere to go? -- he had no home. And the people at home wouldn't accept him, because once you become a monk and you live in a monastery for twelve years, coming back home is failing. It is not respectable. The whole town would laugh at him, that he had failed, and his family would feel bad. Better not to go to them.\nThen where to go? He was just standing in the town, an unknown city, not\nknowing whore to go, what to do. A woman looked from the window. I he monk was standing there... he was a beautiful man. The woman called him. Not knowing who she was And even if he had known, there was no problem now.\nThe woman, who was a prostitute, called him, and he went to live with her.\nThe prostitute fell in love with him. She danced and she played music. She was a great singer, a great musician, a great dancer, and he forgot everything that he had learned for twelve years with his master, the Zen koan and all, completely forgot -- as if everything was erased, as if he had never been to the monastery.\nHe was making love that night to the woman -- I have never come across as beautiful a story as this -- and when he came to the climax, suddenly he heard one hand clapping! In deep love there comes a moment where two become one.\nThe two energies meet: yin and yang, man and woman. The man disappears and the woman disappears; there is no yin and no yang. A circle, a non-duality.\nSuddenly, the koan was solved! He HEARD the sound of one hand clapping. It is said that he jumped out of bed, jumped out of the window.\nThe woman couldn't believe it: \"What are you doing? Have you gone mad? \" He said, \"Let me go to my master first. It has happened!\"\nHe went to the master and, wonder of wonders, the master was waiting outside the temple for the disciple. He said, \"So it has happened? This is no time to come and see me. Two o'clock -- in the middle of the night!\"\nThe master was waiting for him. Before it happens to the disciple, the master knows. If you are tuned with the master, if you have really surrendered to the master, when it happens to you it will happen to your master also. The master lives, many times, many satoris through his disciples. His own satori is complete: he has arrived. But many times through his disciples.… Whenever a disciple arrives again, he again arrives through him. Again, the same dance.\nLife is God, love is God. Remember this much, and don't be worried about knowledge.\n\"Will I know when I am ready to face you?\" You will face me. You will jump out\nof the bed, you will jump out of the window and you will rush. And you will not know what is happening. That happening is greater than you. How can you know it? It is vaster than you. How can you comprehend it? You are just a drop in it; it is oceanic. But later on, when everything is settled again and you are at home with this ecstasy, this satori, SAMADHI, then the mind comes back.\nRecognition starts, thinking starts.\nRecognition is of the mind; the realization is not of the mind. In the deep moment of realization, the mind stops. The phenomenon is such, and so unknown, that the mind cannot function, cannot cope with it. When it has gone, then the mind comes back. Then it starts looking and watching and thinking and brooding.\nThen suddenly a recognition arises: so it has happened?\nSo it has happened? The mind cannot believe in it because the mind is a doubter. But it has to believe it. Believe it or not, it has happened.\nRecognition will follow realization. you will know when it has happened, but you will not know beforehand. And there is no need. If you know beforehand, your knowledge will become the barrier. So please don't be concerned about Question 2\nHOW CAN I SERVE YOU?\nJust be yourself. There is no other service to me.\nJust be yourself; that's how you can serve me. That's how you have already served me -- if you are yourself. My whole effort is to help you to be yourself. If you are centered, rooted, grounded, if you have come to a point where you are not worried to become somebody else, where the ambition to become somebody else has dropped -- when there is no desire to move into the future, when the present is enough unto itself; when you are deeply contented as you are; when you can thank God, when you can be grateful and there arises no complaint; when your whole heart is simply full of gratitude -- you have served me. There is no other way.\nOf course it would have been easier if I had given you some other ways to serve\nme, because those things you can do. You can come and massage my feet. That won't help; that is not of much use. That is not going to lead you anywhere. You may feel happy, but that happiness is not bliss.\nMy whole effort is: fall back on yourself. Don't move into the future and don't be motivated by the future. If THIS moment becomes your total reality, you have come close to me, the closest that one being can come to another. By being yourself, you will be near me; by trying to be something else, you will go far away.\nDon't be imitators. The mind is an imitator, because it is easier to play the game of imitation than to become authentically true. Many ideas have been given to you: become like a Buddha, become like Jesus. become like Krishna -- as if you have to become everybody else EXCEPT yourself. As if God is only against you.\nHe's for Krishna, for Christ, for Mahavir, for Buddha -- only against you. Then why does He create you? Then He seems simply foolish. Why does He go on creating you? If He's interested in Buddha, Hc can create Buddhas. Why you?\nIt would be simpler. He can go on creating Buddhas... like Ford cars. They go on coming through the assembly line: one car after another: one Buddha after another. That will be good. But God is not interested in it. He never creates Buddha again, have you observed? He never creates, He never bothers to create, a Jesus again. Why?\nThere is no need to repeat. All repetition is dead. He goes on creating the new, the novel. He creates you! He's more interested in you than in creating more Buddhas or more Christs. And remember, He will not repeat you either, so while you are here, be true and authentic. Be your.self.\nI have heard one story. One American made a beautiful teacup and then he wanted to mass-produce it. But to mass-produce it in the States would have been very expensive, so he sent it to Japan to be mass-produced.\nIn transit, the cup handle was broken. The Japanese, as you know, are perfect imitators. They mass-produced it exactly as it was: with a broken handle. They repeated it exactly as it was!\nThis has been going on. God goes on creating the new, God goes on creating the\nnovel, God goes on creating you, and the imitators in the churches and temples go on saying, \"Be like Jesus. be like Buddha, be like this.\" And in transit, everybody's handle is broken!\nThe transit: two thousand years. Even if Jesus comes back, he will not be able to recognize the Jesus that is worshipped in the churches. Impossible. Jesus was totally a different man -- alive! Churches go on worshipping somebody who was never there. It is their invention.\nWhy do I go on speaking on Jesus, Buddha or Krishna, or Zarathustra or Lao Tzu? This is the reason: I would like to bring you Jesus as he was before the transit: unbroken, complete -- before the priests entered.\nIn one of my friends' house, there's a very valuable painting: a seventeenth- century painting of a great master -- very precious. He loves it so much that he's always afraid to even clean it. Something may be destroyed; it is old and very fragile.\nBut much dust had gathered on it and an expert had to be called. When the expert started cleaning it, a new problem arose: the paint started peeling off. The expert was very worried. He said, \"Should I stop? \"\nI was staying with the friend. I said, \"Don't stop. You go ahead.\" The friend was not there, otherwise he would have stopped the man.\nBut he said, \"It may be destroyed.\"\nI said, \"Don't be worried. You just go ahead, because I can see something else behind the painting.\"\nAnd it was so. When the paint peeled off, it was discovered that the real painting was hidden behind. Some other painter had just tried to improve on the master.\nThere were two paintings, and the real came out only when the imposed painting and the paint peeled off. Then everybody was happy. But the risk was there!\nWhen I talk on jesus, I am trying to peel off the paint with which Christianity has tried to improve upon the original face of the master. But it is natural in transit.\nThings change.\nYou be true to yourself. Never try to be anybody else. That is the only sin I call sin. Accept yourself! Whatsoever you are, you are beautiful. God accepts you; you also accept yourself. He created you in His own image. He trusts; He has committed himself in your being. Don't betray Him, don't become imitators.\nThat is the only way you can serve me: by being yourself. Be thyself! Suddenly you will be close to me, the closest that is possible. By being imitators, by trying to be somebody else, you falsify your being; you become a traitor. All ideals are treacherous and all ideals are betrayals.\nI don't teach you any ideal, and I don't want you to become anything that is not intrinsic to you. You don't know who you are; that is the difficulty in being oneself. One has to remain content with the unknown.\nI have heard: When the apostle, Paul, reached Athens, he told the people of Athens, \"You are good, you are great in your thinking, you have given the greatest philosophies to the world. But one thing I have observed: I have seen one temple in your city which is devoted to the unknown God. Inside there is no statue -- just inscribed on a marble:'This temple is devoted to the unknown God.'\"\nPaul said, \"This is not enough: an unknown God. This is not sufficient. Your foundation is incomplete. I give you the known God, because only with the known God is a foundation possible. Your culture, your civilization, lacks foundation.\"\nBut I tell you, only the unknown God IS the God. Once you are devoted to a known God you have started falsifying already, because the known will be knowledge, the known will be part of your mind. Buddha is known -- easy to imitate. Jesus is known -- easy to imitate. YOU are unknown. And I teach you to remain true to the unknown God.\nThe known is easy. You can tackle it; you can cope with it. To move into the unknown needs much courage, needs daring. And religion is the greatest adventure. It is not a consolation, it is not a convenience, it is not respectability. It is to move into the unknown, the uncharted, and to risk life.\nWhat Paul said to the Greeks is dangerous. This man Paul talks sense but is very dangerous. You will also feel that a known God is better than an unknown God, because with the known we can relate easily; with a map we can move easily.\nBut I tell you again and again, there is no better way to be lost than to have a map.\nIn the world of truth, all maps are false, because the truth is undefined and remains indefinable. Defined, it becomes untrue. That's what Lao Tzu means when he says: \"The truth cannot be said. Once said, it is no more the truth.\"\nGod IS unknown. Or, it would be even better to say, the unknown is God. And that unknown resides in you, abides in you. If you want to serve me and to be close to me, be close to your unknown God which is within you. Serve that unknown God which is within you, help that unknown God to be: to expand, to become, to flow, to flower.\nQuestion 3\nTHE STRANGEST THING HAS HAPPENED: I FEEL HAPPY! MY PROBLEMS\nSEEM TRANSPARENT, AND I FEEL MORE AND MORE ALIVE. YOU TALK\nABOUT THE NEED TO DIE. HOW CAN MY HAPPINESS LEAD ME THROUGH'THE DARK NIGHT OF THE SOUL'?\nThis is from Sambuddha. Now, Sambuddha, please don't try to create new problems.\nThis is how the mind functions. Even if you are happy, you feel uneasy. You, and happy? -- impossible. Something must have gone wrong; it doesn't fit with the idea that you have of yourself. You, and happy? You must have gone mad, or you must be imagining, or this man, Rajneesh, has hypnotized you. You, and happy? -- impossible.\nNow, Sambuddha, don't try to create new problems. Forget all that I say about dying, because in the happiest moments one dies. The death I am talking about is not the death of misery; the death I am talking about is not the death of suffering, is not the death of agony. The death I am talking about is the death of ecstasy, the death of pure bliss, the death when you are so happy that you explode and simply disappear.\nBut don't be worried about it. It will come by itself; it is already on the way. If you become worried and you become concerned about'why I am so happy'.…\n\"The strangest thing has happened: I feel happy! \" If you become worried about it. soon the happiness will disappear and you will fall back to your old state of mind.\nEnjoy it. Move deeply into it. Dare! The mind has become so miserly and so miserable that when happiness happens. then too it clings to its old past. It is afraid to move. How to be happy? How to laugh? Even if it laughs, it laughs halfheartedly. Even if it moves, it moves ready to withdraw any moment if something goes wrong. And happiness wants you to be totally in it. It claims you totally!\nEnjoy it, move into it, be possessed by it, and in that possession will be death. Totally possessed by happiness, the ego dies.\nI don't teach suffering. I don't teach sacrifice, I don't teach renunciation. I teach the death that comes out of bliss; the death that comes at the highest peak of happiness; the death that comes when you are dancing, singing, loving; the death that comes when you are possessed by the whole and the ocean drops into the drop. Of course, the drop dies. Such a tremendous phenomenon: the ocean dropping in the drop. How can the drop live now? But what is the point of living? It the drop tries to live, that wi]l be a real death. If the drop disappears in the ocean This is what Jesus calls'life, and more abundant life'.\nAllow it! Very difficult. People go on seeking happiness but when it comes, they close their doors. People go on seeking love, but when it knock.s at the door, they hide somewhere in the closet. People go on seeking friendship and when somebody comes near, they become panicky; they become afraid.\nWhat is the fear of happiness? The fear of death. What is the fear in love? The fear of death. What is the fear of freedom? The fear of death. The ego is afraid.\nThe ego can remain in misery., it can remain even in the seventh hell, but even a slight breeze of happiness and the house of the ego starts falling, collapsing.\nNothing kills like happiness, nothing kills like ecstasy; but that risk is worth taking because only after that death does real life arise. You disappear. Then God\nlives in you. Question 4\nWHY IS RELIGION A DIRTY WORD FOR ME, AND WHY DOES IT\nTHREATEN ME FAR MORE HERE IN POONA THAN IT EVER DID BEFORE?\nReligion HAS become a dirty word. It has been used too much and abused too much. It has passed through thousands and thousands of hands. It is just like an old coin or an old currency note which has been passing through many hands and has become dirty. Everything used too much becomes dirty -- not only religion.\nAll beautiful words have become dirty.'God','love','ecstasy' -- all have become dirty. The reason is natural, obvious. Because the words are so beautiful, humanity tends to use them too much. Just look at advertisements and you will find all the beautiful words -- used for cigarettes, soaps, cars, furniture. All beautiful words. The advertisement for a cigarette can even say that the cigarette is ecstatic. Now, a beautiful word is being dirtied.\nEvery film, every movie, is thought to be'marvelous','fabulous'. If everything is fabulous, and every movie is fabulous, then nothing is fabulous. The word does not mean much now. If you say something is fabulous, it doesn't mean anything.\nIt simply means that you have been listening to TV too much!\nAll beautiful words become dirty because the mind tends to use them more and more, for every and any thing. Religion has become dirty.…\nIt is the oldest thing in the world. There is a controversy about which profession is the oldest. Prostitutes and priests are the two competitors. I have also been thinking about it and I cannot conceive of how prostitutes can come before priests. Impossible! Unless the priest is there, how is prostitution imaginable?\nImpossible. The priest must have come first. He must have condemned sex; then prostitution follows. He must have condemned it so much that the whole thing becomes very attractive.\nReligion HAS become a dirty word. but remember well: when a word is dirty, that does not mean that the thing that is denoted by the word is dirty. Religion, the word, may have become dirty, but religion, the thing, is still fresh and will always remain fresh.\nYou can use another word for it. Any word will do; that is not a problem.\nRemember, just because a word has become dirty, don't throw away the thing itself. That will be throwing out the baby with the bath water. The bath water has become dirty -- true, throw it! -- but at least save the baby. If you can save the baby, there is no trouble.\nChurches have made it dirty. They have made a profession out of it, they have corrupted it. They made it so low because they had to bring it to the masses.\nThey made it very cheap, as if there is no need on your part to do anything. They come and give you the Bible free; they go on throwing religion on you, they go on imposing. They don't ask even your permission. They are intruders, pretenders. They have corrupted it.\nBut they have not corrupted religion as such. They have corrupted only the word. Forget the word, but don't forget the reality that is indicated by it.\nThat may be the cause: \"... and why does it threaten me more here in Poona?\"\nBecause I am not concerned about the word; I am concerned about religion itself.\nIt threatens more. If you go to a church you will come back intact. As you had gone in, you will come out: the same. But if you come to me, you cannot go back the same.\nIf you really come close to me, in that very coming you will be transformed and changed. You may escape, you may get afraid, scared, but you will never be the same again. I will go on haunting you wherever you are. I will come in your dreams, I will follow you like a shadow.\nThe fear is real, the threat is real. When you go to a church, the priest is a false threat. He may thunder, but the threat is false. He may shout at you in the name of God, but the threat is false.\nI have heard: it happened in a Zen temple. One morning there was a great earthquake -- as it happens in Japan. Half the temple collapsed. The priest, who had been pretending that he was a real Zen man, immediately gathered his disciples and said, \"Look. Now you must have observed what is the real quality of a real Zen man. The earthquake was there, but there was not even an iota of fear in me. Have you observed? I remained as if nothing had happened. Not only that, you must have seen that after the earthquake stopped, I went to the kitchen because I was thirsty, and I drank a big glass of water. Did you observe that my hand was not trembling at all while I was holding the glass?\"\nOne disciple smiled. The priest felt annoyed. He said, \"What is funny in it? Why are you smiling? \"\nThe disciple said, \"Reverend sir, it was not a glass of water. It was a big glass of soy sauce that you drank!\"\nWhen you want to show off, from somewhere or other the reality is bound to leak.\nGo to a priest. His talk is okay -- never more than okay, just okay -- but if you look into the reality of the man, there is no fear. He is just like you. He may pretend... and you may even pretend that whatsoever he is pretending is true.\nThat's how it goes on. Pretensions need mutual cooperation. Hc pretends that he is a great master, you pretend that you are a great disciple. He accepts your pretension; you accept his pretension. That's how both are satisfied mutually.\nAnd things remain the same.\nWhen you are here, you are really near a danger point. I AM a dangerous man. You should be alert about it. Come close to me with full awareness -- there IS\ndanger. I am not a priest. I'm not teaching religion here; I'm ready to give it to you. It is not a teaching, it is a transmission.\nIn churches you have learned that the words'religion','God' -- they have all become dirty. Then you come to me and you start realizing that those words may have become dirty, but something is hidden behind them which is ever fresh, ever green, ever alive and capable of changing you totally. Then the fear arises.\nJust the other day, Atmada wrote me a letter, a beautiful letter, saying, \"Why are you so worried about this Jesus being crucified? It is good that this idiot was crucified! Why are you worried about it? \"\nIn fact, this is all that the priests have done. Trying to force Jesus on you, trying to be aggressive, intruders on your being, somehow trying to convert you to Jesus, they have dirtied the very name of this beautiful man. Trying to prove that he is the greatest wise man in the world, they have only been able to magnify his defects and nothing else.\nThat's why Atmada writes to me that he was an idiot. I know that he was, but that is how a wise man always is.\nThat point has to be understood. A really wise man is a synthesis of whatever you call wisdom, and idiocy. He is as simple as an idiot and as complex as any wise man can be.\nYou can look at him from both sides. If you look at him from one side. he will look like an idiot. You can find in Jesus all the things that you can find in idiots.\nRead Feodor Dostoevski's book, THE IDIOT. It is about an idiot, but in that idiot you will find all the beautiful qualities that Jesus has: the innocence, the quality of no-mind, the quality of trust. Never a doubt arises. These are all idiotic qualities. You call a man an idiot if he trusts everybody and anybody; you call a man an idiot if you go on deceiving him and he still goes on trusting you. You go on deceiving him and he goes on trusting you. You cannot create doubt in him because he has no mind.\nA man like Jesus is also like an idiot. Not because he has the same state of idiocy; he has come to the same state from a very different dimension. the circle is complete: he has again become a child.\nThe idiot is below mind, Jesus is above mind -- both are no-minds. The idiot has got no mind. Jesus and Buddha also have got no minds, but there is a difference.\nThey HAD, and they found out that to have a mind is foolish. They dropped it: they have become idiots voluntarily. They are not stupid. They are idiots because they are wise.\nYes, I know: Jesus, Lao Tzu, Buddha, look like idiots. In India we have a word\nfor the idiot which comes from Buddha. It is BUDDHU. The word is derived from Buddha himself. Buddha: BUDDHU. BUDDHU means'idiot' and BUDDHA means'the awakened man'. How can both these words be together?\nWhen Buddha died, his impact was tremendous. Thousands and thousands of people became followers. Thousands and thousands of people were sitting under Bodhi trees with closed eyes, meditating. People would call to them:\n\"BUDDHUS, go home! What are you doing? Don't be a BUDDHU. Do something, go home. Your wife is suffering, your children are hungry. Don't be an idiot! Don't be a BUDDHU!\"\nI know, Jesus is so innocent that he looks foolish. But that foolishness is tremendously precious.\nI am also idiotic, Atmada. And whatsoever I am teaching is teaching you to be so simple and trusting that you also become idiots in a sense. But that idiocy is the supreme awareness, that idiocy is supreme wisdom. Polarities meet: dualities disappear.\nIn a Jesus, you will always find a paradox: he's opposites together. You will find in him qualities which are feminine, you will find in him qualities which are absolutely male. They meet and mingle, and they have become one. In him, the feminine and the male have become one; the wise man and the fool have become one. The polarities have disappeared. The contradiction is no more a contradiction; it is a synthesis.\nDifficult for the mind to understand. The mind is a doubter the mind is skeptical. And the mind thinks that it is very intelligent. Mind is stupid, mind is mediocre.\nIt has nothing to do with intelligence. Intelligence is a totally different flowering of your being; it has nothing to do with mind. Mind is just a mechanism; it is a computer, a bio-computer. Very complex, but still a mechanism. It has nothing to do with intelligence.\nIntelligence comes within you only when you have become so unidentified with the mind that you can see that mind is separate and you are separate. In that state, intelligence happens. That intelligence will be both wise and foolish.\nThat is the mystery of a Jesus. That is the paradox, the poetry. Question 5\nTHE PEAKS ARE GETTING PRETTY WONDERFUL, BUT THE VALLEYS ARE\nDEEPER AND DARKER THAN EVER. FINDING BALANCE SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE. WHAT TO DO?\nThere is no need to do anything. You are not to find balance, balance will find you. You simply move. When the valley comes, you go into the valley. When darkness surrounds you, enjoy it, feel blissful in the velvety touch of it. Move into it, into the infinite magnificence of it. Darkness has a soothing quality which no light can have. The valley is a rest: like the night, like death.\nNo need to try to find balance. The balance will find you. You simply move into the valley. When the valley comes, you accept it. You not only accept it, you welcome it. You enjoy it, you delight in it -- darkness is beautiful. And when the valley goes and you move towards the peak, that too is perfectly beautiful. That is beautiful: the light, the morning, the sun.\nBut don't cling to either. Clinging creates trouble; through clinging, anguish comes. If you cling to the peak and you say, \"I would not like to go to the valley again,\" then you will be in trouble. Then at the very peak you have created the valley. Then, already, the suffering has started. You are afraid: fear has entered, the agony is already there. You are no longer happy. You have destroyed the peak.\nWhen you are in the valley you will suffer that \"now the valley has come.\" You will suffer the valley, and you will not be able to enjoy the peak. This is the ordinary situation.\nWhen you are happy, you become afraid. Is this happiness going to stay or will it be gone? Now fear eats away at your happiness like a worm and poisons it. You are happy and yet you are not happy. Something is already dead: you have become apprehensive of the future. When you are unhappy, of course, you are unhappy. When you are happy you cannot be happy, so how can you be happy when you are unhappy? The whole life becomes a vicious circle of unhappiness.\nNow, listen! When you are at the peak, dance. I know, and you know, that the peak is not going to last forever. There is no need. If it lasts forever, it will be such a tension that you will not be able to tolerate it. It will be such an excitement that you will not find any rest in it. It will be dangerous, it will kill you. No need for it to last forever. But while it lasts, dance, enjoy, sing -- knowing well that it is going to he lost again. Knowing it, one has to enjoy it even more before it is lost.\nAnd remember, this is the miracle: when you enjoy it more it lasts longer. When you are happy in it and dancing, it forgets to go away from you. It lingers with you. When YOU don't cling to it, it clings to you. This is the whole secret.\nAnd when it is gone, then too it is not gone. It has given you such a deep blissfulness that now you go into the valley and you can rest in darkness. Then the valley becomes relaxation and the peak becomes enjoyment. Then the peak becomes the day and the valley becomes the night: then the peak becomes activity and the valley becomes passivity.\nOne has to enjoy the night also. That is the only way to enjoy the day. And if you enjoy the day, a great night comes with great rest. It refreshes you, rejuvenates you.\nAlways remember: the greater the peak, the greater will be the valley. Otherwise how can the peak be greater? If you go to the Himalayas you will find that the greater the peak the greater the valley. If you are afraid of the valley, then don't ask for the peaks. Then move on plain ground. There will be no peak and no valley.\nThat is the most miserable life: where there is no peak, no valley. One simply vegetates. It is not a life. One simply drags. It is a monotony. It is not a dialogue; it is a monologue. A dialogue needs duality, a dialogue needs contradiction, a dialogue needs polarity, a dialogue needs paradox. And within the paradox, you move from one pole to another.\nDon't be worried about balance. Balance will seek you; I will see that balance seeks you. You simply do this much: while on the peak, dance; while in the valley, rest. Accept the valley; accept the peak. Both are parts of the one whole and you cannot deny one part. They are two aspects of the same coin.\nRemember, one who enjoys more is bound to suffer more because he becomes\nvery sensitive. But suffering is not bad. If you understand it rightly, suffering is a cleansing. If you understand it rightly, sadness has a depth to it which no happiness can ever have. A person who is simply happy is always superficial. A person who has not known sorrow and has not known sadness, has not known the depths. He has not touched the bottom of his being; he has remained just on the periphery. One has to move within these two banks. Within these two banks flows the river.\nAnd I tell you, balance will seek you if you accept both and you live both.\nWhatsoever happens, you welcome it. Suddenly. one day you will see that balance has come. And when balance comes to you, it is something totally different than that balance which you can force upon yourself.\nIf you force the balance, it will be a.sort of control. A control is always artificial, a control is always ugly. Control has a violence in it. It is forced, artificial. When balance comes to you, it is a happening. Suddenly it descends on you. Heavens open and the spirit of God, like a dove, descends in you.\nAll that is great always comes. All that YOU make is always small, petty. It is never great. All that you do is going to be lesser than you. All that is great -- you have to allow it. Balance will find you. God will find you. You just be ready.\nAnd this is readiness: to accept whatsoever comes, to accept it with gratefulness. Even sorrow, even sadness. even the valley... dark.\nQuestion 6\nOSHO, THE OTHER DAY YOU LOVINGLY TOLD ME TO BE MORE\nCONCERNED ABOUT MYSELF AND LESS ABOUT OTHERS. THANK YOU\nOSHO. I GOT THE POINT. AND YET I MUST ASK ONE MORE QUESTION\nNOT TO DO WITH ME BUT WITH YOU. WHAT EXACTLY IS HAPPENING\nWITH YOU? EVERY MONTH YOUR BODY IS BECOMING MORE SENSITIVE\nIN EVERY WAY AND THE PHENOMENON. EVEN TO MY STATE OF\nUNAWARENESS, IS AWESOME. CAN YOU SAY SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR\nCHANGES?\nThis is from Chaitanya Sagar. Good that he says this is the last question that he is asking not about himself!\nI can understand your worry, your concern. The fact is simple. After the age of thirty-five life starts declining. Thirty-five is the peak: if you are going to live for seventy years, thirty-five is the peak. After thirty-five you start declining. It is now downhill.\nIf somebody becomes enlightened after thirty-five -- as Buddha became at forty, Mahavir became at forty -- then he can live a little longer, because he was already downhill. Enlightenment will not disturb the body more than it was already disturbed.\nIf you become enlightened before the age of thirty-five then there is danger.\nShankara became enlightened before the age of thirty-five. He died at thirty- three. When you are going uphill and life is moving strong -- and you become enlightened -- the connection between you and the body is disrupted. It has almost always happened that people who have become enlightened before thirty- five have not survived up to thirty-five. Difficult. The body and you become so separate that the uphill task becomes very difficult.\nIt is just like: you were going uphill and suddenly you see that there is no more petrol in the tank of the car. The uphill task becomes almost impossible. Now you get out and you have to push the car uphill. Very difficult. But if you become aware when the car is going downhill that there is no more petrol, there is no trouble. In fact. there is no need for petrol. The car can go without petrol.\nShankara died at thirty-three. Buddha lived up to eighty; Mahavir also lived up to eighty. It has to be understood. I should have died before thirty-five in fact.\nSomehow I have been pulling. That'somehow' can be understood.\nI have dropped out of life by and by; I have dropped all activity. Whatsoever energy my body has, I am using for you, that's all. Otherwise I have dropped all activity: stopped moving, stopped travelling -- I have almost stopped everything.\nI come out just to see you in the morning and in the evening. Otherwise I have become completely inactive. absolutely passive. Whatsoever small energy is there, I am using it as economically as possible.\nSo every day my body is going to become more and more fragile, more and more sensitive. My ship is ready -- any moment I can depart. I am lingering on the bank for you a little while more. That's why I'm in a hurry. You have time to ask useless questions. I don't have time to answer them.\nYou have time to waste. My time is finished. So if you really want to use this opportunity, don't miss a single moment. Don't hesitate, and don't put your halfheart in the effort. When I am gone, you will repent and you will be very sorry, but then nothing can be done. While I am still here, use every opportunity that I am giving to you and don't waste a single moment. I HAVE what you are seeking. I can pour it into you, but your cup is not ready.\nThe thing is like this: you come to me and I have a full kettle of tea. And you are thirsty. I would like to give it to you, but I cannot pour it in your hands. It will burn you. I have to wait, because you will have to produce your cup. And that cup can be produced only from your innermost core of being.\nOnly your innermost being can become the cup. Only then can I pour whatsoever I have got. I am waiting for you so that you can produce the cup.\nYou are thirsty I know, and I have that which can quench your thirst, but the cup is not ready.\nSo don't ask such questions. Rather, look at me and try to understand.\nJust the other night one sannyasin was saying, \"How can you help us when you yourself are not well in the body?\" True. If I am not well in the body, how can I help you? Looks absolutely logical. But do you know: was Buddha well in the body?\nNo enlightened person has ever been well in the body -- cannot be! -- because the being with the body is disrupted, the bridge is broken. The body goes on moving on its own, and the being goes on residing in it, but the energy that was given by the identification is not given.\nYou live as one with your body. I live as two. My body is just like my clothes -- absolutely separate. It is a miracle that it is functioning.\nBuddha had to keep a physician continuously with him because every moment was danger. The physician was not for HIM. His work was done; he had achieved. The physician was for those who were still thirsty. He had something which could quench their thirst. The physician was for them.\nIf the doctor comes to see me, it is not for me. It is for you. If I see that there is no point and I cannot help you, this very moment I can disappear.\nBut many of you are working hard. I have the largest number of sannyasins that is possible in this twentieth-century world: almost fifteen thousand all around the world. They are all working hard. If they can succeed, we will release one of the greatest energies. spiritual energies, in the world.\nI have to wait, and I have to linger on -- whatsoever the body says. The body says: \"It is time, the ship is ready. You can go.\" The house is ready to collapse, but I am holding it.\nDon't waste my time in anything. Use it if you can. This is the trouble: that you may not understand now, but later on, when you understand, I will not be there.\nThen that understanding will not be of much help. It will simply give you deep anguish. and sorrow, and agony.\nWhile I am here, it you understand me, it can become your ecstasy. When I am gone, it will be just an agony.\nCome Follow To You, Vol 2 Chapter #9 Chapter title: He that soweth the good seed 8 November 1975 am in Buddha Hall MATTHEW 13\n34 ALL THESE THINGS SPAKE JESUS UNTO THE MULTITUDE IN\nPARABLES; AND WITHOUT A PARABLE SPAKE HE NOT UNTO THEM: 36 THEN JESUS SENT THE MULTITUDE AWAY, AND WENT INTO THE\nHOUSE: AND HIS DISCIPLES CAME UNTO HlM, SAYING, DECLARE UNTO\nUS THE PARABLE OF THE TARES OF THE FIELD.\n37 HE ANSWERED AND SAID UNTO THEM, HE THAT SOWETH THE GOOD\nSEED IS THE SON OF MAN;\n38 THE FIELD IS THE WORLD; THE GOOD SEED ARE THE CHILDREN OF\nTHE KINGDOM; BUT THE TARES ARE THE CHILDREN OF THE WICKED\nONE;\n39 THE ENEMY THAT SOWED THEM IS THE DEVIL; THE HARVEST IS THE\nEND OF THE WORLD; AND THE REAPERS ARE THE ANGELS.\n40 AS THEREFORE THE TARES ARE GATHERED AND BURNED IN THE FIRE; SO SHALL IT BE IN THE END OF THIS WORLD.\n41 THE SON OF MAN SHALL SEND FORTH HIS ANGELS, AND THEY\nSHALL GATHER OUT OF HIS KINGDOM ALL THINGS THAT OFFEND, AND\nTHEM WHICH DO INIQUITY;\n42 AND SHALL CAST THEM INTO A FURNACE OF FIRE: THERE SHALL BE\nWAILING AND GNASHING OF TEETH.\n43 THEN SHALL THE RIGHTEOUS SHINE FORTH AS THE SUN IN THE KINGDOM OF THEIR FATHER.

I would like to read them to you:\nA man said to the universe, \"Sir, I exist.\"\n\"However,\" replied the universe, \"the fact has not created in me a sense of obligation.\"\nMan can exist in two ways. One, that the whole celebrates him; one, that the whole welcomes him; one, that the whole feels blessed because of him -- and the other, that the whole feels cursed.\nMan can live a life of goodness, truth and beauty; and man can live a life of untruth, evil and ugliness. Man is free to live and to choose. Man is a tremendous freedom; that is his innermost nature. Nothing is forced. Hence the beauty of the adventure, and hence the danger also. You have to choose. Your choice will determine your being, your choice will become your destiny. On each step, every moment, you have to decide who you are.\nPeople come to me and they ask who they are. It is not a question of inquiry because the being is not a static thing waiting to be discovered by you. The being has to be created moment to moment. That is the only way to discover it.\nYou create yourself moment to moment. You are not born as a fixed entity, but only as a infinite potentiality. You are born as a seed, not as a tree. You are born open, not closed. That opening is tremendous. You will have to choose every moment who you are going to be. Your decision is your destiny. And unless you live life so that the whole feels blessed, you are not religious.\nA religious life is a life of spontaneity. A religious life is a life of flow, of dynamism. A religious life is a life of prayer.\nPrayer is the supreme good. Let me explain to you what prayer is.\nIt is not something that you do; it has nothing to do with doing. It is something that you become, by and by. It is something that you live; it is something that surrounds you like a climate. It is something like a deep gratitude. Looking at the trees, or looking at the sea, or looking at the grass, a tremendous urge arises in you to say thank you. That is prayer.\nNot that you say it. It is not in the saying but in the very urge, in the very mood that you would like to say, unconditionally: \"Thank you.\" Not knowing to whom your thank-you is addressed... not knowing who is the creator of the morning, and the evening, and the stars, and the moon, and the sun... not knowing whose hands are hidden behind every grass-leaf and who is smiling in every dewdrop -\n- not knowing at all.\nKnowledge is ugly; not knowing is beautiful. Remember, not knowing is not ignorance. Not knowing is ultimate knowledge. It transcends even what you call knowledge. Not knowing is innocence. In deep innocence, a thank-you arises; unaddressed, not knowing to whom you are addressing. But that is not the point.\nDeep within your being, in your depths, you feel gratitude.\nPrayer is the feeling of the unknown presence. That feeling of the unknown presence becomes reverence. And prayer has to be just like breathing. It is not that you do it and you are finished with it. It is something that goes on and on and on like breathing. Awake or asleep, it surrounds you; it throbs within your\nheart. It becomes almost YOU; there exists no separation.\nA life of prayer is what I call a good life. A life of gratitude is what I call a religious life.\nThis life of spontaneity, of flow, does not know what sin is. Sin comes from knowledge. That is the meaning of the Biblical story. When Adam ate the fruit of the tree of knowledge, he sinned. Then he was thrown out of the Garden of Eden.\nThis story has no parallel, this story is simply unique. BECAUSE he ate the fruit of the tree of knowledge.…\nNo other religion has emphasized, in such a crystal clear way, that knowledge is sin and unless you become like children again, you will not become good. Unless you again drop all knowledge and you become innocent, uncorrupted by knowledge, you will not be accepted back. The source will go on rejecting you.\nNot that the source wants to reject you. But the way you behave, through knowledge, you create the situation for your own rejection. God has to expel Adam and Eve. Not that He wanted to -- He must have wept, because they were His children -- but He was helpless.\nWhenever you create the feeling of helplessness in the whole, you commit sin.\nWhenever you force the whole to reject you, you commit sin. Whenever you force the whole to throw you out of the garden, you commit sin.\nSin is behaving in a cunning way, behaving as if you know. Sin is to be self- complacent, sin is to think that you are enough unto yourself. A child is not enough unto himself, a child is helpless. A child does not know anything; he acts out of innocence. Then it is good. The moment you start acting out of knowledge, it is sin.\nTry to understand the import of what I'm saying. I'm saying that if, out of knowledge, you live a virtuous life, it is not virtuous. You can have character out of knowledge, you can have a quality of morality out of knowledge, but then it is not moral'When you are still eating the fruit or the tree of knowledge.\nDeep down, your so-called saints are sinners, because they still go on getting\nnourishment from the tree of knowledge. The real sage is innocent. He acts -- but not because of the commandments, because all commandments are sin. He acts out of his totality; he responds in the moment.\nHe does not act out of the mind. To act out of the mind is to sin, to act out of the mind is to be thrown out of the garden, out of the kingdom of God. Once you accept the mind as your source of activity, you have denied God. And in your denial of God, you are denied.\nWhenever you act out of the mind your act is going to be fragmented, because mind is a split phenomenon. Mind is not one: it is many, it is a multitude. Its names are legion. Whenever you act out of the mind, only a part acts -- against the whole. Whenever you act out of no-mind.…\nSometimes you act -- you know that there are moments when you act out of no- mind. You are walking. You have gone for a long morning walk or evening walk.\nand suddenly a snake crosses the path. You don't have time to think. Mind needs time; mind is a time process. You don't have time to think. If you think, you will be finished! The snake is there and the snake is not going to wait for you to think.\nThe snake acts out of no-mind; you will be in danger if you believe in mind. But you will act out of no-mind. You will simply jump.\nRemember -- and watch! You will jump first, and then you will think about what has happened. That jump comes out of your totality; it is not of the mind. That jump is a spontaneous total. It is here and now. It has nothing to do with past, nothing to do with future. It has no past, no future. it is absolutely here, now.\nThe duality of good is the quality of an act which comes out of your totality. You fall in love: you see a man or a woman and suddenly, in spite of you, something happens. Your total being responds in a new way. Even you are surprised! You throb, you sing, you have a dance within you, as if clouds have separated and you have seen the source of light. In a single moment.… In fact, that moment is not a part of time. In fact, it is a'no moment' -- as if time has stopped. Something has taken possession of you. This is out of no-mind.\nWhatsoever is like love is good. That's why Jesus says, \"God is love.\" He's not.saying that God is loving. He's simply showing a quality: that God has the\nsame quality as love.'Good' is love; good has the same quality as love.\nAll that comes from the mind is from the devil -- DEVIL is just a way of saying it\n-- because the mind separates. Let mc define devil as one who separates, and God as one who unites. God and devil are both ways of speaking. They are not entities, they are symbols.\nJust a few days before, I read a beautiful story of DuBois'. I would like you to listen to it and try to understand it:\nIt was one o'clock and I was hungry. I walked into a restaurant, seated myself, and reached for the bill of fare. My table companion rose. \"Sir,\" said he, \"do you wish to force your company on those who don't want you?\"\n\"No,\" I said. \"I wish to eat.\"\n\"Are you aware, sir, that this is social equality?\" \"Nothing of the sort, sir. It is hunger,\" I said, and I ate.\nThe day's work done, I sought the theater. As I sank into my seat, the lady next to me shrank and squirmed. \"I beg pardon,\" I said.\n\"Do you enjoy where you're not wanted?\" she asked coldly. \"Oh, no,\" I said.\n\"Well, you are not wanted here.\"\nI was surprised. \"I fear you are mistaken,\" I said. \"I certainly want the music, and I like to think the music wants me to listen to it.\"\n\"Oh sir,\" said the lady, \"this is social equality.\"\n\"No, madam,\" said the usher. \"It is the second movement of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.\"\nAfter the theater, I sought the hotel where I had sent my baggage. The clerk scowled. \"What do you want?\"\n\"Rest,\" I said.\n\"This is a white hotel,\" he said.\nI looked around. \"Such a color scheme requires a great deal of cleaning,\" I said. \"But I don't know that I object.\"\n\"We object! \" said he.\n\"Then why -- \" I began, but he interrupted.\n\"We don't keep niggers,\" he said. \"We don't want social equality.\" \"Neither do I,\" I replied gently. \"I want a bed.\"\nI walked thoughtfully to the train. \"I will take a sleeper though Texas. I'm a little bit dissatisfied with this town.\"\n\"Can't sell you one.\"\n\"I only want to hire it,\" said I, \"for a couple of nights.\"\n\"Can't sell you a sleeper in Texas,\" he maintained. \"They consider that social equality.\"\n\"I consider it barbarism,\" I said, \"and I think I will walk.\"\nWalking, I met another wayfarer who immediately walked to the other side of the road where it was very muddy. I asked his reason.\n\"Niggers is dirty,\" he said.\n\"So is mud,\" said I. \"Moreover, I am not as dirty as you, vet.\" \"But you are a nigger, aren't you?\" he asked.\n\"My grandfather was so called.\"\n\"Well then?\" he answered triumphantly.\n\"Do you live in the south?\" I persisted pleasantly. \"Sure,\" he growled. \"And starve there.\"\n\"I should think that you and the Negroes should get together and vote out starvation.\"\n\"We don't let them vote! We?\" \"Why not?\" I said in surprise. \"Niggers is too ignorant to vote.\"\n\"But,\" I said,'I am not so ignorant as you.\" \"But you are a nigger?\"\n\"Yes, I am certainly what you mean by that.\"\n\"Well then?\" he returned with that curiously inconsequential note of triumph. \"Moreover,\" he said, \"I don't want my sister to marry a nigger.\"\nI had not seen his sister, so I merely murmured, \"Let her say no.\" \"By God, you shall not marry her even if she said yes!\"\n\"But I don't want to marry her,\" I answered, a little perturbed at the personal turn.\n\"Why not?\" he yelled, angrier than ever.\n\"Because I am already married. And I rather like my wife.\" \"Is she a nigger?\" he asked suspiciously.\n\"Well,\" I said again, \"her grandmother was called that.\" \"Well then?\" he shouted in that oddly illogical way.\nI gave up. \"Go on,\" I said, \"either you are crazy or I am.\"\n\"We both are,\" he said as he trotted along in the mud.\nMind is crazy; mind is mad. Mind creates divisions, fragments. Mind creates nations, races -- white and black, poor and rich. Mind is the devil. When you can feel that you are one with all, you have gone beyond mind. To feel one with all, to feel a unison, is to be good. And to act out of that oneness is to be religious.\nA religious man has no character. A religious man has a spontaneity. A religious man has a moment to moment contact with the whole. That contact is never lost.\nHe lives prayerfully. A nonreligious man may be apparently good, moral, he may have a character, but he is frozen, dead. He acts out of that character: out of the mind, out of knowledge, out of rules. He is never in contact with the whole; he is always out of step. That's what I call'devil'; that's what I call'bad'.\nAnd that's what Jesus means by this parable. He has not been understood, he has been very much misunderstood. But if you can carry this feeling of what good is and what bad is, you will be able to go deep into this parable.\nALL THESE THINGS SPAKE JESUS UNTO THE MULTITUDE IN PARABLES; AND WITHOUT A PARABLE SPAKE HE NOT UNTO THEM:\nTHEN JESUS SENT THE MULTITUDE AWAY, AND WENT INTO THE\nHOUSE: AND HIS DISCIPLES CAME UNTO HIM, SAYING, DEC]ARE UNTO\nUS THE PARABLE OF THE TARES OF THE FIELD.\nJesus always talked in parables. A parable is a poetic way of saying things which cannot be said in prose. It is a very feeling way of saying things from the heart --\nthings which cannot be expressed by the head. A parable is a way of talking in pictures, not in words.\nHave you ever observed that children always understand pictures? That's why, in children's books, you have to have many colored pictures. Text, not much; pictures, many. First they understand the pictures, and then they understand the text.\nIn your dreams, you are again living in parables. You have pictures and pictures and pictures -- the text is not much. Your unconscious understands only pictures.\nYour conscious has become trained for language, words, but your unconscious is still that of a child.\nWhen Jesus, a man like Jesus, is talking, he is trying to bridge something between himself and your unconscious. He is not a preacher. When a preacher talks to you, he talks in concepts. He is trying to communicate from one head to another head. When a man like Jesus, Buddha or Zarathustra talks, he is trying to communicate something from his innermost depth to your innermost depth. He always uses parables.\nA parable becomes a picture. Logic is not needed to understand it. If you can love sympathetically, that will do: if you can listen sympathetically, that will do.\nIf you can listen in deep trust, that is enough: no logic is needed. The parable will manifest itself, will surround you, will become part of your being. You may forget the message, but you will never forget the parable. It will be deeply imprinted it will remain within you forever and ever. Stories have a way of penetrating to the innermost core.\nALL THESE THINGS SPAKE JESUS UNTO THE MULTITUDE IN PARABLES; AND WITHOUT A PARABLE SPAKE HE NOT UNTO THEM:\nTHEN JESUS SENT THIS MULTITUDE AWAY. AND WENT INTO THE\nHOUSE: AND HIS DISCIPLES CAME UNTO HIM, SAYING, DECLARE UNTO\nUS THE PARABLE OF THE TARES OF THE FIELD.\nHe must have used that parable with the multitude, with the crowd. The disciples wanted to know what he means. The disciples wanted to know the exact significance of the parable.\nHE ANSWERED AND SAID UNTO THEM, HE THAT SOWETH THE GOOD\nSEED IS THE SON OF MAN:\nTHE FIELD IS THE WORLD; THE GOOD SEED ARE THE CHILDREN OF THE\nKINGDOM: BUT THE TARES ARE THE CHILDREN OF THE WICKED ONE; THE ENEMY THAT SOWED THEM IS THE DEVIL: THE HARVEST IS THE\nEND OF THE WORLD; AND THE REAPERS ARE THE ANGELS.\nAS THEREFORE THE TARES ARE GATHERED AND BURNED IN THE FIRE; SO SHALL IT BE IN THE END OF THIS WORLD.\nTHE SON OF MAN SHALL SEND FORTH HIS ANGELS, AND THEY SHALL\nGATHER OUT OF HIS KINGDOM ALL THINGS THAT OFFEND, AND THEM\nWHICH DO INIQUITY;\nAND SHALL CAST THEM INTO THE FURNACE OF FIRE: THERE SHALL BE\nWAILING AND GNASHING OF TEETH.\nTHEN SHALL THE RIGHTEOUS SHINE FORTH AS THE SUN IN THE KINGDOM OF THEIR FATHER. WHO HATH EARS TO HEAR, LET HIM HEAR.\nA simple parable, but very significant. Move step by step into it: HE THAT SOWETH THE GOOD SEED IS THE SON OF MAN.\nTHE SON OF MAN has a very particular meaning in the Jewish literature. It is used only for the prophets. Ordinarily, whomsoever you call human beings are not yet human beings. They have the potentiality to be, but they have not actualized it. They are just like seeds. They have not yet sprouted, they have not yet bloomed. Their fragrance is just a possibility; it is not yet actual.\nJews call a man'son of man' if he has become perfectly actualized: the perfect man. He is no more just potential. He has bloomed, flowered. 'The son of man'\nis a very, very respectful expression. It is next only to'son of God'. And unless you become son of man, you will not be able to become son of God. First become actualized human beings: real, authentic, true. Then the next step becomes possible. Then you can transcend humanity and you can become son of God.\nAgain and again, Jesus uses for himself'son of man' -- more than he ever uses'son of God'. Rarely does he use'son of God' -- often he uses the expression'son of man' -- because for those who have not become even human beings, the son of God is a myth. They cannot understand it. You can understand only that which has become in some way actual within you; you can understand only that which has become part of you.\nYou are part-human beings. When Jesus says'son of man', at least a part within you can respond that yes, he is true. A part within you can trust him. But when he says'son of God', he's moving in some direction about which you are completely oblivious. You have not known it, you have not even heard about it.\nIt makes no sense to you.\nSo he uses the expression'son of God' only very rarely, only with very close disciples who are growing, by and by, into divinity; whose hands are touching the divine, who have been groping and now they have come to the door; who have attained a small glimpse of the ultimate. Only then he uses'son of God'.\nOtherwise he says'son of man'.\nHE ANSWERED AND SAID UNTO THEM, HE THAT SOWETH THE GOOD\nSEED IS THE SON OF MAN.\nOne who has become actualized, one who has become really human -- how will you know him? Because this crystallization will be his innermost phenomenon, you will not be able to see it. You will not be able to look within him: you will not be able to understand what has happened within him. That will remain a mystery to you, it will remain hidden. But one thing you can watch, one thing\nyou can see and understand, and that is: HE THAT SOWETH THE GOOD SEED\nIS THE SON OF MAN.\nYou will see through his acts, through his words, even through his gestures, that he is sowing the seed of good. Whatsoever he does, howsoever he moves -- even walking. sitting, sleeping -- he is continuously sowing seeds of good. His whole life is nothing but a showering of good seeds all around. Wherever he moves, he goes on sowing good seeds.\nNot that he thinks about it deliberately, not that he plans about it, not that he makes any effort about it, not that he has become very skilled in a certain discipline -- no. Spontaneously He cannot help it. That's how he is. That's how\nit happens to him; that's how his whole being functions now. Goodness/good deeds/good is the functioning of one who has become actualized.\nRemember, you have been taught just the opposite. You have been taught: become good in your acts, so that you can realize yourself. That is wrong; that is looking at the thing from the wrong end. The real teachers have not said that.\nThey have said just the opposite. They have said: become actualized. and you will find that your acts have become good.\nThe character is not to be cultivated. A cultivated character is immoral, howsoever moral it appears. A cultivated character is a bondage, it is an imprisonment. and whomsoever you call men of character are all frozen: dead people, blocked. They need to be melted so that they can flow again.\nThey may be good, but they stink. They may be good, but it is very difficult to live with them. They may be good, but they are very paralyzing to others --\ncrippling. If you live with them, they will become a heavy weight on your chest. They will c rush you and destroy you. They are destructive.\nWhen you are really in contact with a good man, a good man whose goodness is not forced and cultivated, but one who has realized his potentiality and now the goodness flows It is just like the fragrance of a flower which ha.s opened.\nWhen the flower opens, the fragrance spreads. Not otherwise. Otherwise you call just have a plastic flower that you can spray with perfume. A character that has to be maintained, controlled, is like sprayed perfume. The flower is not real.\nJesus says: HE THAT SOWETH THE GOOD SEED IS THE SON OF MAN.\nRecognize that he is the son of man. You will be able to know it from his acts. He does not act through morality, through discipline. He acts out of his heart. You cannot see his heart without seeing his acts. That is your blindness.\nAnd never try to follow the acts of good people. That's how the whole world has become almost dead -- a great graveyard. I was just reading a few days before that Paul, St. Paul, said to his people: \"I imitate Christ. You imitate me. That is the way.\"\nThis is dangerous teaching. This man Paul has completely misunderstood. He says \"I imitate Christ. You imitate me.\" He says: \"Do whatsoever I do. That's the way.\" These are the people who destroy the message of Christ completely.\nIf you imitate, you will remain false. You may become Christ-like, but you will not be a Christ. You may become Buddha-like, but you will not be a Buddha, You will be just a pseudo-Buddha, a false thing, an untrue thing. That is not going to make you blissful, and that is not going to create a sense of obligation in existence.\nHE ANSWERED AND SAID UNTO THEM, HE THAT SOWETH THE GOOD\nSEED IS THE SON OF MAN. This is the way you will recognize him, that's all.\nTHE FIELD IS THE WORLD; THE GOOD SEED ARE THE CHILDREN OF THE\nKINGDOM; BUT THE TARES ARE THE CHILDREN OF THE WICKED ONE.\nHow to translate this WICKED ONE -- the devil, the beelzebub, the satan -- into today's twentieth-century language? I call it: the mind.\nBuddha is more modern, more contemporary than Jesus. Buddha will never say\nthis. He will say the mind corrupts, not the devil.'Devil' is a symbolic way of saying the same thing.\nBut dangerous. Because then in Christianity, the devil became very, very important; and in the Christian mind, the devil became a reality. God also became a personalized reality. They are not persons; they are both interpretations of a certain inner phenomenon.\nthe inner phenomenon is that your being can function in two ways: either through the mind or through the no-mind. If you work through the mind, that is what Jesus calls THE WICKED ONE. If you work through the no mind, then you function through your nature. That's what Buddha calls nirvana: selflessness, ANATTA, enlightenment.\nYou are separate from the mind. Once you know how to function without the mind, how to bypass it, how to put the mind aside, then you are functioning in the totality, WITH the totality. Then you are in tune with it. Then you are not like an island. You have surrendered and you have become part of the mainland, the continent. Then you are not separate from existence. It is not that YOU exist: then God exists in you. Then the ego has disappeared like a dewdrop in the morning sun.\nTHE FIELD IS THE WORLD; THE GOOD SEED ARE THE CHILDREN OF THE\nKINGDOM; BUT THE TARES ARE THE CHILDREN OF THE WICKED ONE: THE ENEMY THAT SOWED THEM IS THE DEVIL --\nThe devil is not outside you. It is very tempting to think of him as outside, because then you can throw all the responsibility on him and you can become completely free of the responsibility. People have always been using scapegoats to throw their responsibilities on.\nWhatsoever is wrong with you, you will always find some cause for it in somebody else. Somebody says something and you feel angry. Now you think that he has insulted you. In fact, you have become angered -- not that he has insulted you. If you were a little more aware, there would have been no anger, and then there would have been no insult either.\nYou throw responsibility. One feels good just putting the responsibility on others'\nshoulders. This is one of the oldest ways that the human mind has always been defending itself. Once you can say and argue that somebody else is responsible, you can relax and you can be yourself, whatsoever you are. There is no need to transform yourself.\nBut if you see that the devil is within and that there is no point in throwing out the responsibility on somebody else -- you are the problem -- then to live with the problem becomes difficult. To live with the problem becomes almost impossible. A moment comes when you have to drop it; it is too much. It is foolish and stupid to carry it. You are not benefitted by it; you are simply crushed under the weight.\nNever throw the responsibility on some devil outside. The devil is within -- as much within as God is within. If you function through the mind, this is the devil.\nIf you function without mind -- if you function through meditation, no-mind -- it is God. God is a function of you. The devil is also a function of you.\nIf you function unaware, unalert, not remembering yourself, you have allowed the devil to enter in you. And remember, I am not being anthropomorphic at all.\nThere is nobody outside who enters within you. These are only ways of speaking.\nTHE ENEMY THAT SOWED THEM IS THE DEVIL; THE HARVEST IS THE\nEND OF THE WORLD; AND THE REAPERS ARE THE ANGELS.\nAS THEREFORE THE TARES ARE GATHERED AND BURNED IN THE FIRE; SO SHALL IT BE IN THE END OF THIS WORLD.\nTHE SON OF MAN SHALL SEND FORTH HIS ANGELS, AND THEY SHALL\nGATHER OUT OF HIS KINGDOM ALL THINGS THAT OFFEND, AND THEM\nWHICH DO INIQUITY;\nAND SHALL CAST THEM INTO A FURNACE OF FIRE: THERE SHALL BE\nWAILING AND GNASHING OF TEETH.\nTHEN SHALL THE RIGHTEOUS SHINE FORTH AS THE SUN IN THE KINGDOM OF THEIR FATHER. WHO HATH EARS TO HEAR, LET HIM HEAR.\nJesus is saying that the good survives and the bad dies. Jesus is saying that the good is eternal and the bad temporary. Jesus is saying that the good remains and the bad is momentary. This has to be understood.\nForget his words, they have become out of date. Christians go on talking about these words and explaining them. The words are dead. What he says is very significant, and will always remain significant, but the language has to be changed.\nListen to how different it sounds if I say: good is that which is to survive. Maybe temporarily it is defeated, but eventually, finally, it wins. In India we say:'SATYA MEVA JAYATE... truth wins, eventually.' Maybe in the moment the lie appears to win, but that cannot be so, finally. A lie is a lie and will be exposed someday or other. It cannot become eternity. Just think: how can a lie become eternity? It has no roots in existence, it has no being of its own. Even if it exists for the moment, it has no being of its own. Even if it exists for the moment, it has to borrow its being from some truth.\nThat's why, whenever you assert a lie, you defend it. You argue for it, you try to prove it, and you like to say that \"This is truth.\" You are trying to borrow being and life from truth... for the lie. But a borrowed life is a lie. For a moment it may deceive, but it cannot deceive eternally; it cannot deceive for ever and ever.\nSomeday or other, it is bound to be exposed.\nA lie is a lie, and cannot become true. And a truth is a truth, maybe hidden for the moment, misunderstood -- not heard, heard wrongly, interpreted wrongly --\nbut a truth is a truth. A diamond is a diamond. It may be lost in the mud, but it is\nnot the mud and it cannot become the mud. Finally, it has to be discovered.\nTruth is eternal. Or, it will be better if we say it just the other way around: that which is eternal is true.\nDon't cling to anything which is not eternal. Otherwise you are living with a lie.\nAnd all the time that you lived with it is simply wasted. The lie will be exposed and you will find y our hands empty.\nJesus is saying that, in the end, good survives and all that is bad dies in fire, is destroyed. So look, watch your life. What are you sowing? The world is a field, life is an opportunity. What are you sowing?\nAre you sowing love or are you sowing only lust' If yOU are sowing only lust, in the end you will come to know. And you will have to repent much, because that lust was just a momentary fantasy: ungrounded, without any roots. It was just in the mind. Love? Then you can rely upon it. Then you are building your house on a rock, not on the sand.\nWhat are you accumulating in the world? Possessions? things? wealth? Then you are deceived by the devil: by the mind, by ambition, desire.\nOr are you trying to realize who you are? The real wealth.'I he only thing that can be possessed is your being, because you already possess it. Nothing else can be possessed. If you are searching for one thing that you can possess and can be yours -- and can be yours for ever and ever, even death cannot take it away from you -- then you are sowing the seeds which Jesus calls THE CHILDREN OF THE\nKINGDOM.\nIf you are a little alert.… And I hope that you are. Otherwise you cannot be near me; you cannot be here. A part of you has become alert. Hence, you are here. A part has become awake. Just watch from that corner which has become lighted.\nJust look at your past. Do you find anything which can be eternal, which can be existential for ever and ever? If not, then your life has been wasted. Don't go on repeating it. Jump out of the vicious circle, stop that wheel. If you think that yes, there is something which can be eternal, then water it. Protect it; help it to grow.\nThat is how one finds one's religion. It is not found in the Bible, it is not found in the Gita or Koran. It is found in one's own experience. Watch, observe, and go on separating the good seeds from the bad. Before God rejects them, please, you reject them. Don't carry anything with you that is to be thrown in the fire. Don't carry anything with you that is going to die.\nIt is going to be hard, arduous, to separate yourself from false things, because you have attached so much significance to false things. You go on wasting your life for things of no import -- childish.\nA man goes on accumulating wealth. He goes on thinking that someday in the future he is going to live; right now he is preparing. But that preparation is never fulfilled. One day, suddenly, he dies. The accumulated wealth is there and somebody else will become the possessor. This man wasted his whole life. He could have lived, he could have lived beautifully -- because, in fact, if you want to live, all that is needed is already given to you.\nLet me repeat it: if you want to live, all that is needed is already given to you.\nThere is no need to prepare. All preparation is a postponement, all preparation is a trick of the devil -- the mind. The mind says: how can you live now? How can you dance? First you need a marble floor; then you can dance.\nSo first have a marble floor. Then you can dance. Do you see the fallacy in it? If you want to dance, the beach is enough; the earth is enough. If you want to dance, you can dance anywhere, anytime. Every moment is as good as any other.\nNothing else is needed. Only life is needed in you, and that is there. You need a flowing life, that's all. To dance, that's all that's needed. Not even a training for dancing is needed. Life itself is the dance. You just allow it to happen.\nYou want to sing? Then for what are you waiting? You want to love? Then for what are you postponing? This is the only moment there is, and this is the only life there is. Forget about the future and start being alive here and now. And remember, if you are alive this moment, the next moment you will find yourself more alive, because the next moment is born out of this moment.\nAnd if you miss this moment, a great punishment is there. Not that somebody who goes on punishing you is sitting there on a golden throne in heaven, If you miss this moment and you don't dance, by and by you lose the capacity to dance.\nThat is the punishment. That is the only punishment; there is nobody who is punishing you.\nIf you pray this moment, you are rewarded, because the next moment a great prayer is waiting. If you don't pray this moment, you lose the capacity to pray.\nBy and by, you become absolutely incapable of praying. Then you go and ask people how to pray, how to meditate, how to love.\nJust look at the absurdity of the questions: how to love? how to pray? how to meditate? how to live? Absurd questions... but they show the poverty, the inner poverty of man. He has been postponing everything, and by and by he has forgotten. Every child knows how to Fay, and every child knows how to love, and every child knows how to dance, and every child knows how to live. Every child comes complete, with everything ready. One just has to start living.\nHave you seen? If you are crying and a small child is watching, he will come near you. He cannot say much, he cannot argue you out of your crying, but he puts his hand on your hand. Have you felt the touch? Never again will anybody touch you like that, like a child can touch. He knows how to touch. Later on, people are simply cold, hard. They touch, but nothing flows from their hands.\nWhen a child touches you -- the tenderness of it, the softness of it: the message -\n-\nhe pours his whole being in it.\nEverybody is born complete to live. And the more you live, the more capable you become of life. That is the reward. The less you live, the less capable you are.\nThat is the punishment.\nThe religion you have to seek is within you. You have to watch your life moment to moment and drop all that seems to be momentary. It may be very exciting, but futile in the end. Drop it! Look deep into those moments which may not be so exciting. The eternal cannot be very exciting, because that which has to be for ever and ever has to be very silent, peaceful. Blissful, of course, but not exciting.\nDeeply blissful, but with no noise around it. More like a silence than like sound.\nYou will have to grow in awareness so you can sort it out. Otherwise, in the end, you will find that you have lived a futile life. That's what Jesus calls THE TARES\nOF THE FIELD.\nWHO HATH EARS TO HEAR, LET HIM HEAR.\nAGAIN, THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN IS LIKE UNTO TREASURE HID IN A FIELD; THE WHICH WHEN A MAN HATH FOUND, HE HIDETH, AND FOR\nJOY THEREOF GOETH AND SELLETH ALL THAT HE HATH, AND BUYETH\nTHAT FIELD.\nYes, that is how it is. Once you come to know the eternal, the essential, the infinite, once you have come to feel it, then you are ready to go and sell all that you have been possessing, that you have been accumulating. Then you are ready to sell everything just to have this treasure of eternity.\nI will repeat it again:\nAGAIN, THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN IS LIKE UNTO TREASURE HID IN A FIELD; THE WHICH WHEN A MAN HATH FOUND, HE HIDETH, AND FOR\nJOY THEREOF GOETH AND SELLETH ALL THAT HE HATH, AND BUYETH\nTHAT FIELD.\nThis is what my sannyas is all about.\nSeek the eternal. Whatsoever the cost, stake all for it and you will not be a loser. Try to save that which you have accumulated and you will be lost. Says Jesus: \"Those who.save their lives, lose them: and those who are ready to lose them,\nattain to life -- to life abundant.\" Come Follow To You, Vol 2 Chapter #10\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"15179","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/come_follow_to_you__vol_2/part3/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/come_follow_to_you__vol_2/>Come Follow To You - Vol 2</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: The fear of happiness</h1><div class=post-meta>72 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;15179 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Come_Follow_To_You__Vol_2/part3.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part2>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

Hall</h3><p>Question 1</p><p>OSHO, WILL I KNOW WHEN I AM READY TO FACE YOU?</p><p>YOU WILL FACE ME; knowledge will come later on. Not the otherwise --
not that knowledge will come first and then you will face me. Knowledge
will not precede; reality will precede. Knowledge is a shadow: it
follows. Once you start thinking that knowledge precedes, you are in a
mess. I will tell you one story: One evening a monk knocked at the doors
of a Zen monastery. He wanted to stay over for the night. He was tired,
hungry. I he host opened the door, but rather than greeting him by a
hello or good evening, he encountered him with a Zen koan -- very
famous. He said: "What is your original face, the face that you had
before your father and mother were born? "</p><p>The monk took off his sandal from his foot and hit the host hard on
the face. The host stepped back, bowed down and said, "Welcome, you are
welcome. Your understanding is tremendous."</p><p>Then they had dinner. In the cold night they were sitting by the
fireplace chitchatting, and the guest asked, "Have you got the answer
yourself or not? The koan that you asked me -- have you got the answer
of it yourself or not?"</p><p>The host said, "I am not that fortunate. No, I have not got the
answer. But I recognized it when you gave me the answer. Because I have
read so much about Zen, and heard so much about Zen, I could recognize
the immediacy of your answer. You didn't hesitate for a single moment,
you didn't think it. It came out of your totality. It was not from the
head -- that much I could recognize."</p><p>The guest didn't answer. He continued sipping his tea. But then the
host became a little suspicious. He looked again at the face of the
guest and he found there was something he didn't like. So he asked
again, "Please, tell me: do you really know the answer? Have you got the
answer? "</p><p>The guest started laughing, he starting rolling on the mat in deep
mirth. He said,</p><p>"No, sir. I have also read too much about Zen and heard too much
about Zen."</p><p>If knowledge becomes too much, that becomes the barrier. You can know
without knowing. That is the danger of knowledge. You can know, not
knowing at all. Deep inside you remain ignorant, but on the surface you
know everything that can be known.</p><p>You can deceive others, but the greater danger is that someday you
may be deceived by yourself, you may deceive yourself. Then all
possibility for growth stops.</p><p>Never be bothered about knowledge. The whole quest should be for
reality, for that which is. You should not be worried about it. That is
the difference between theology and religion: theology goes on talking
about God; religion TALKS God, not about. The'about' is the realm of
theology. The priests, the preachers, they go on talking about and
about. Religion is not talking about reality. Religion TALKS</p><p>reality.</p><p>You ask me, "Will I know when I am ready to face you?" You will face
me first; then you will know. Knowledge always follows. It is a
recognition when the real thing has happened. You will not know God
before knowing Him. You will know Him first and then, as a shadow,
knowledge will follow. You will recognize later on what has happened.
The happening is first; recognition is later.</p><p>Sometimes it may take much time to recognize, because mind is
stupid.</p><p>Sometimes it may take much time to recognize. It may happen many
times in your life -- you may have attained a few moments of tremendous
reality, authenticity, but you couldn't recognize them. They are lost in
the desert. Before you could recognize them they were gone, and then
there were other things: the mind became engaged. You missed.</p><p>This is my observation: that you cannot find a single human being on
the whole of the earth who has not had some moments of reality. In spite
of yourself, sometimes the glimpse comes to you, because it is not only
you who is seeking reality -- the reality is also seeking you. It is not
only that you need God: God is in tremendous need of man. You cannot be
without Him; He cannot be without you.</p><p>You can forget Him, but He cannot ever forget you. You may be
standing with your back towards Him, but He goes on trying to reach you.
Your hands may be very small; His hands are not small. He can reach you
wherever you are, even in the seventh hell. And He goes on groping for
you, remember this.</p><p>That's why many times -- not because of you, in spite of you -- a
glimpse happens. But you cannot recognize it. Many people have religious
experiences but they cannot recognize them as religious. Sometimes they
are aesthetic experiences. No true aesthetic experience can be other
than religious.</p><p>When you see a beautiful face of a man or a woman or a child, if
really you are struck by the beauty, the experience is not only
aesthetic; it is religious. In that moment of beauty, God has looked at
you through that face; God has revealed himself to you through that
face. Through those eyes, the depth of existence has tried to
communicate with the depth of your being. Depth has talked to depth,
there has been a dialogue. It has not only been aesthetic.</p><p>Suddenly one morning you are light and graceful. You are fresh and
unburdened. The past is no more haunting you and the future has not yet
started. You look at the sky, a vast emptiness, and everything stops
within you.</p><p>You also become a vast emptiness. It is not just an aesthetic
experience; it is religious. Beauty is truth... and truth is
beautiful!</p><p>Sometimes you hear music and the mind stops. The music surrounds you,
you are drowned in it. You are no more there. Just a transparent
presence: the music goes through and through. In that moment, it is not
only music that is happening; it is religion. But you don't recognize
it.</p><p>You think religion happens only in the church, where dead priests go
on beating around the bush? In fact, the church is the last place for
religion to happen. It is a graveyard; God is not alive there. A church
is full of dead gods. They were alive once, somewhere in the past. They
are just histories now.</p><p>When Jesus walked on earth, around him religious experiences were
happening.</p><p>But now Jesus is a dead myth. He's worshipped in churches, preached
about and about, but he's not there.</p><p>The church, the temple, is the last place for religion to happen, for
God to</p><p>penetrate you. He comes to you in more alive ways. He comes through
the wife, through the child, through the husband, through the friend.
Sometimes, even through the enemy. Flowers and ocean and sand and the
mountains and the stars and the birds: He comes in a thousand and one
ways, but always alive.</p><p>He's life; you can forget the name'God'. The word has become very
dirty -- drop it! Just call Him life, that will do; call Him existence
or being, that will do. If truth seems too harsh, call Him love, that
will do. If truth has been too much monopolized by philosophers, drop
it. Love is perfectly beautiful.</p><p>Wherever you have had any poetic experience, wherever your heart has
become a.small poem -- something throbbed within you, something unknown
-- there is religion. Recognition may take time. Sometimes for lives you
may not be able to recognize. And when you recognize you will simply
laugh, you will go mad with Laughter, because in that recognition many
other things which were left unrecognized will also be recognized.</p><p>I have heard about a Zen monk -- the story is simply unbelievable! He
worked hard. His master had given him a koan, a Zen puzzle to work out.
The koan was: if one hand claps, what will be the sound? Not two hands
clapping with each other; just one hand clapping in emptiness. What will
be the sound? Try to hear it.</p><p>He tried and tried, but he couldn't hear it. Years passed. He would
go to the master, he would always bring something that he had heard, and
the master would reject it immediately. Even before he had said
anything, the master would say, "No! Don't bring any.stupidity here. Go
back. Work hard."</p><p>It is said that twelve years passed and the master never even gave an
appreciative look. He was harsh and the disciple lost his heart, he lost
his nerve.</p><p>He escaped from the monastery.</p><p>Where to go? -- he had no home. And the people at home wouldn't
accept him, because once you become a monk and you live in a monastery
for twelve years, coming back home is failing. It is not respectable.
The whole town would laugh at him, that he had failed, and his family
would feel bad. Better not to go to them.</p><p>Then where to go? He was just standing in the town, an unknown city,
not</p><p>knowing whore to go, what to do. A woman looked from the window. I he
monk was standing there... he was a beautiful man. The woman called him.
Not knowing who she was And even if he had known, there was no problem
now.</p><p>The woman, who was a prostitute, called him, and he went to live with
her.</p><p>The prostitute fell in love with him. She danced and she played
music. She was a great singer, a great musician, a great dancer, and he
forgot everything that he had learned for twelve years with his master,
the Zen koan and all, completely forgot -- as if everything was erased,
as if he had never been to the monastery.</p><p>He was making love that night to the woman -- I have never come
across as beautiful a story as this -- and when he came to the climax,
suddenly he heard one hand clapping! In deep love there comes a moment
where two become one.</p><p>The two energies meet: yin and yang, man and woman. The man
disappears and the woman disappears; there is no yin and no yang. A
circle, a non-duality.</p><p>Suddenly, the koan was solved! He HEARD the sound of one hand
clapping. It is said that he jumped out of bed, jumped out of the
window.</p><p>The woman couldn't believe it: "What are you doing? Have you gone
mad? " He said, "Let me go to my master first. It has happened!"</p><p>He went to the master and, wonder of wonders, the master was waiting
outside the temple for the disciple. He said, "So it has happened? This
is no time to come and see me. Two o'clock -- in the middle of the
night!"</p><p>The master was waiting for him. Before it happens to the disciple,
the master knows. If you are tuned with the master, if you have really
surrendered to the master, when it happens to you it will happen to your
master also. The master lives, many times, many satoris through his
disciples. His own satori is complete: he has arrived. But many times
through his disciples.… Whenever a disciple arrives again, he again
arrives through him. Again, the same dance.</p><p>Life is God, love is God. Remember this much, and don't be worried
about knowledge.</p><p>"Will I know when I am ready to face you?" You will face me. You will
jump out</p><p>of the bed, you will jump out of the window and you will rush. And
you will not know what is happening. That happening is greater than you.
How can you know it? It is vaster than you. How can you comprehend it?
You are just a drop in it; it is oceanic. But later on, when everything
is settled again and you are at home with this ecstasy, this satori,
SAMADHI, then the mind comes back.</p><p>Recognition starts, thinking starts.</p><p>Recognition is of the mind; the realization is not of the mind. In
the deep moment of realization, the mind stops. The phenomenon is such,
and so unknown, that the mind cannot function, cannot cope with it. When
it has gone, then the mind comes back. Then it starts looking and
watching and thinking and brooding.</p><p>Then suddenly a recognition arises: so it has happened?</p><p>So it has happened? The mind cannot believe in it because the mind is
a doubter. But it has to believe it. Believe it or not, it has
happened.</p><p>Recognition will follow realization. you will know when it has
happened, but you will not know beforehand. And there is no need. If you
know beforehand, your knowledge will become the barrier. So please don't
be concerned about Question 2</p><p>HOW CAN I SERVE YOU?</p><p>Just be yourself. There is no other service to me.</p><p>Just be yourself; that's how you can serve me. That's how you have
already served me -- if you are yourself. My whole effort is to help you
to be yourself. If you are centered, rooted, grounded, if you have come
to a point where you are not worried to become somebody else, where the
ambition to become somebody else has dropped -- when there is no desire
to move into the future, when the present is enough unto itself; when
you are deeply contented as you are; when you can thank God, when you
can be grateful and there arises no complaint; when your whole heart is
simply full of gratitude -- you have served me. There is no other
way.</p><p>Of course it would have been easier if I had given you some other
ways to serve</p><p>me, because those things you can do. You can come and massage my
feet. That won't help; that is not of much use. That is not going to
lead you anywhere. You may feel happy, but that happiness is not
bliss.</p><p>My whole effort is: fall back on yourself. Don't move into the future
and don't be motivated by the future. If THIS moment becomes your total
reality, you have come close to me, the closest that one being can come
to another. By being yourself, you will be near me; by trying to be
something else, you will go far away.</p><p>Don't be imitators. The mind is an imitator, because it is easier to
play the game of imitation than to become authentically true. Many ideas
have been given to you: become like a Buddha, become like Jesus. become
like Krishna -- as if you have to become everybody else EXCEPT yourself.
As if God is only against you.</p><p>He's for Krishna, for Christ, for Mahavir, for Buddha -- only against
you. Then why does He create you? Then He seems simply foolish. Why does
He go on creating you? If He's interested in Buddha, Hc can create
Buddhas. Why you?</p><p>It would be simpler. He can go on creating Buddhas... like Ford cars.
They go on coming through the assembly line: one car after another: one
Buddha after another. That will be good. But God is not interested in
it. He never creates Buddha again, have you observed? He never creates,
He never bothers to create, a Jesus again. Why?</p><p>There is no need to repeat. All repetition is dead. He goes on
creating the new, the novel. He creates you! He's more interested in you
than in creating more Buddhas or more Christs. And remember, He will not
repeat you either, so while you are here, be true and authentic. Be
your.self.</p><p>I have heard one story. One American made a beautiful teacup and then
he wanted to mass-produce it. But to mass-produce it in the States would
have been very expensive, so he sent it to Japan to be
mass-produced.</p><p>In transit, the cup handle was broken. The Japanese, as you know, are
perfect imitators. They mass-produced it exactly as it was: with a
broken handle. They repeated it exactly as it was!</p><p>This has been going on. God goes on creating the new, God goes on
creating the</p><p>novel, God goes on creating you, and the imitators in the churches
and temples go on saying, "Be like Jesus. be like Buddha, be like this."
And in transit, everybody's handle is broken!</p><p>The transit: two thousand years. Even if Jesus comes back, he will
not be able to recognize the Jesus that is worshipped in the churches.
Impossible. Jesus was totally a different man -- alive! Churches go on
worshipping somebody who was never there. It is their invention.</p><p>Why do I go on speaking on Jesus, Buddha or Krishna, or Zarathustra
or Lao Tzu? This is the reason: I would like to bring you Jesus as he
was before the transit: unbroken, complete -- before the priests
entered.</p><p>In one of my friends' house, there's a very valuable painting: a
seventeenth- century painting of a great master -- very precious. He
loves it so much that he's always afraid to even clean it. Something may
be destroyed; it is old and very fragile.</p><p>But much dust had gathered on it and an expert had to be called. When
the expert started cleaning it, a new problem arose: the paint started
peeling off. The expert was very worried. He said, "Should I stop? "</p><p>I was staying with the friend. I said, "Don't stop. You go ahead."
The friend was not there, otherwise he would have stopped the man.</p><p>But he said, "It may be destroyed."</p><p>I said, "Don't be worried. You just go ahead, because I can see
something else behind the painting."</p><p>And it was so. When the paint peeled off, it was discovered that the
real painting was hidden behind. Some other painter had just tried to
improve on the master.</p><p>There were two paintings, and the real came out only when the imposed
painting and the paint peeled off. Then everybody was happy. But the
risk was there!</p><p>When I talk on jesus, I am trying to peel off the paint with which
Christianity has tried to improve upon the original face of the master.
But it is natural in transit.</p><p>Things change.</p><p>You be true to yourself. Never try to be anybody else. That is the
only sin I call sin. Accept yourself! Whatsoever you are, you are
beautiful. God accepts you; you also accept yourself. He created you in
His own image. He trusts; He has committed himself in your being. Don't
betray Him, don't become imitators.</p><p>That is the only way you can serve me: by being yourself. Be thyself!
Suddenly you will be close to me, the closest that is possible. By being
imitators, by trying to be somebody else, you falsify your being; you
become a traitor. All ideals are treacherous and all ideals are
betrayals.</p><p>I don't teach you any ideal, and I don't want you to become anything
that is not intrinsic to you. You don't know who you are; that is the
difficulty in being oneself. One has to remain content with the
unknown.</p><p>I have heard: When the apostle, Paul, reached Athens, he told the
people of Athens, "You are good, you are great in your thinking, you
have given the greatest philosophies to the world. But one thing I have
observed: I have seen one temple in your city which is devoted to the
unknown God. Inside there is no statue -- just inscribed on a
marble:'This temple is devoted to the unknown God.'"</p><p>Paul said, "This is not enough: an unknown God. This is not
sufficient. Your foundation is incomplete. I give you the known God,
because only with the known God is a foundation possible. Your culture,
your civilization, lacks foundation."</p><p>But I tell you, only the unknown God IS the God. Once you are devoted
to a known God you have started falsifying already, because the known
will be knowledge, the known will be part of your mind. Buddha is known
-- easy to imitate. Jesus is known -- easy to imitate. YOU are unknown.
And I teach you to remain true to the unknown God.</p><p>The known is easy. You can tackle it; you can cope with it. To move
into the unknown needs much courage, needs daring. And religion is the
greatest adventure. It is not a consolation, it is not a convenience, it
is not respectability. It is to move into the unknown, the uncharted,
and to risk life.</p><p>What Paul said to the Greeks is dangerous. This man Paul talks sense
but is very dangerous. You will also feel that a known God is better
than an unknown God, because with the known we can relate easily; with a
map we can move easily.</p><p>But I tell you again and again, there is no better way to be lost
than to have a map.</p><p>In the world of truth, all maps are false, because the truth is
undefined and remains indefinable. Defined, it becomes untrue. That's
what Lao Tzu means when he says: "The truth cannot be said. Once said,
it is no more the truth."</p><p>God IS unknown. Or, it would be even better to say, the unknown is
God. And that unknown resides in you, abides in you. If you want to
serve me and to be close to me, be close to your unknown God which is
within you. Serve that unknown God which is within you, help that
unknown God to be: to expand, to become, to flow, to flower.</p><p>Question 3</p><p>THE STRANGEST THING HAS HAPPENED: I FEEL HAPPY! MY PROBLEMS</p><p>SEEM TRANSPARENT, AND I FEEL MORE AND MORE ALIVE. YOU TALK</p><p>ABOUT THE NEED TO DIE. HOW CAN MY HAPPINESS LEAD ME THROUGH'THE DARK
NIGHT OF THE SOUL'?</p><p>This is from Sambuddha. Now, Sambuddha, please don't try to create
new problems.</p><p>This is how the mind functions. Even if you are happy, you feel
uneasy. You, and happy? -- impossible. Something must have gone wrong;
it doesn't fit with the idea that you have of yourself. You, and happy?
You must have gone mad, or you must be imagining, or this man, Rajneesh,
has hypnotized you. You, and happy? -- impossible.</p><p>Now, Sambuddha, don't try to create new problems. Forget all that I
say about dying, because in the happiest moments one dies. The death I
am talking about is not the death of misery; the death I am talking
about is not the death of suffering, is not the death of agony. The
death I am talking about is the death of ecstasy, the death of pure
bliss, the death when you are so happy that you explode and simply
disappear.</p><p>But don't be worried about it. It will come by itself; it is already
on the way. If you become worried and you become concerned about'why I
am so happy'.…</p><p>"The strangest thing has happened: I feel happy! " If you become
worried about it. soon the happiness will disappear and you will fall
back to your old state of mind.</p><p>Enjoy it. Move deeply into it. Dare! The mind has become so miserly
and so miserable that when happiness happens. then too it clings to its
old past. It is afraid to move. How to be happy? How to laugh? Even if
it laughs, it laughs halfheartedly. Even if it moves, it moves ready to
withdraw any moment if something goes wrong. And happiness wants you to
be totally in it. It claims you totally!</p><p>Enjoy it, move into it, be possessed by it, and in that possession
will be death. Totally possessed by happiness, the ego dies.</p><p>I don't teach suffering. I don't teach sacrifice, I don't teach
renunciation. I teach the death that comes out of bliss; the death that
comes at the highest peak of happiness; the death that comes when you
are dancing, singing, loving; the death that comes when you are
possessed by the whole and the ocean drops into the drop. Of course, the
drop dies. Such a tremendous phenomenon: the ocean dropping in the drop.
How can the drop live now? But what is the point of living? It the drop
tries to live, that wi]l be a real death. If the drop disappears in the
ocean This is what Jesus calls'life, and more abundant life'.</p><p>Allow it! Very difficult. People go on seeking happiness but when it
comes, they close their doors. People go on seeking love, but when it
knock.s at the door, they hide somewhere in the closet. People go on
seeking friendship and when somebody comes near, they become panicky;
they become afraid.</p><p>What is the fear of happiness? The fear of death. What is the fear in
love? The fear of death. What is the fear of freedom? The fear of death.
The ego is afraid.</p><p>The ego can remain in misery., it can remain even in the seventh
hell, but even a slight breeze of happiness and the house of the ego
starts falling, collapsing.</p><p>Nothing kills like happiness, nothing kills like ecstasy; but that
risk is worth taking because only after that death does real life arise.
You disappear. Then God</p><p>lives in you. Question 4</p><p>WHY IS RELIGION A DIRTY WORD FOR ME, AND WHY DOES IT</p><p>THREATEN ME FAR MORE HERE IN POONA THAN IT EVER DID BEFORE?</p><p>Religion HAS become a dirty word. It has been used too much and
abused too much. It has passed through thousands and thousands of hands.
It is just like an old coin or an old currency note which has been
passing through many hands and has become dirty. Everything used too
much becomes dirty -- not only religion.</p><p>All beautiful words have become dirty.'God','love','ecstasy' -- all
have become dirty. The reason is natural, obvious. Because the words are
so beautiful, humanity tends to use them too much. Just look at
advertisements and you will find all the beautiful words -- used for
cigarettes, soaps, cars, furniture. All beautiful words. The
advertisement for a cigarette can even say that the cigarette is
ecstatic. Now, a beautiful word is being dirtied.</p><p>Every film, every movie, is thought to be'marvelous','fabulous'. If
everything is fabulous, and every movie is fabulous, then nothing is
fabulous. The word does not mean much now. If you say something is
fabulous, it doesn't mean anything.</p><p>It simply means that you have been listening to TV too much!</p><p>All beautiful words become dirty because the mind tends to use them
more and more, for every and any thing. Religion has become dirty.…</p><p>It is the oldest thing in the world. There is a controversy about
which profession is the oldest. Prostitutes and priests are the two
competitors. I have also been thinking about it and I cannot conceive of
how prostitutes can come before priests. Impossible! Unless the priest
is there, how is prostitution imaginable?</p><p>Impossible. The priest must have come first. He must have condemned
sex; then prostitution follows. He must have condemned it so much that
the whole thing becomes very attractive.</p><p>Religion HAS become a dirty word. but remember well: when a word is
dirty, that does not mean that the thing that is denoted by the word is
dirty. Religion, the word, may have become dirty, but religion, the
thing, is still fresh and will always remain fresh.</p><p>You can use another word for it. Any word will do; that is not a
problem.</p><p>Remember, just because a word has become dirty, don't throw away the
thing itself. That will be throwing out the baby with the bath water.
The bath water has become dirty -- true, throw it! -- but at least save
the baby. If you can save the baby, there is no trouble.</p><p>Churches have made it dirty. They have made a profession out of it,
they have corrupted it. They made it so low because they had to bring it
to the masses.</p><p>They made it very cheap, as if there is no need on your part to do
anything. They come and give you the Bible free; they go on throwing
religion on you, they go on imposing. They don't ask even your
permission. They are intruders, pretenders. They have corrupted it.</p><p>But they have not corrupted religion as such. They have corrupted
only the word. Forget the word, but don't forget the reality that is
indicated by it.</p><p>That may be the cause: "... and why does it threaten me more here in
Poona?"</p><p>Because I am not concerned about the word; I am concerned about
religion itself.</p><p>It threatens more. If you go to a church you will come back intact.
As you had gone in, you will come out: the same. But if you come to me,
you cannot go back the same.</p><p>If you really come close to me, in that very coming you will be
transformed and changed. You may escape, you may get afraid, scared, but
you will never be the same again. I will go on haunting you wherever you
are. I will come in your dreams, I will follow you like a shadow.</p><p>The fear is real, the threat is real. When you go to a church, the
priest is a false threat. He may thunder, but the threat is false. He
may shout at you in the name of God, but the threat is false.</p><p>I have heard: it happened in a Zen temple. One morning there was a
great earthquake -- as it happens in Japan. Half the temple collapsed.
The priest, who had been pretending that he was a real Zen man,
immediately gathered his disciples and said, "Look. Now you must have
observed what is the real quality of a real Zen man. The earthquake was
there, but there was not even an iota of fear in me. Have you observed?
I remained as if nothing had happened. Not only that, you must have seen
that after the earthquake stopped, I went to the kitchen because I was
thirsty, and I drank a big glass of water. Did you observe that my hand
was not trembling at all while I was holding the glass?"</p><p>One disciple smiled. The priest felt annoyed. He said, "What is funny
in it? Why are you smiling? "</p><p>The disciple said, "Reverend sir, it was not a glass of water. It was
a big glass of soy sauce that you drank!"</p><p>When you want to show off, from somewhere or other the reality is
bound to leak.</p><p>Go to a priest. His talk is okay -- never more than okay, just okay
-- but if you look into the reality of the man, there is no fear. He is
just like you. He may pretend... and you may even pretend that
whatsoever he is pretending is true.</p><p>That's how it goes on. Pretensions need mutual cooperation. Hc
pretends that he is a great master, you pretend that you are a great
disciple. He accepts your pretension; you accept his pretension. That's
how both are satisfied mutually.</p><p>And things remain the same.</p><p>When you are here, you are really near a danger point. I AM a
dangerous man. You should be alert about it. Come close to me with full
awareness -- there IS</p><p>danger. I am not a priest. I'm not teaching religion here; I'm ready
to give it to you. It is not a teaching, it is a transmission.</p><p>In churches you have learned that the words'religion','God' -- they
have all become dirty. Then you come to me and you start realizing that
those words may have become dirty, but something is hidden behind them
which is ever fresh, ever green, ever alive and capable of changing you
totally. Then the fear arises.</p><p>Just the other day, Atmada wrote me a letter, a beautiful letter,
saying, "Why are you so worried about this Jesus being crucified? It is
good that this idiot was crucified! Why are you worried about it? "</p><p>In fact, this is all that the priests have done. Trying to force
Jesus on you, trying to be aggressive, intruders on your being, somehow
trying to convert you to Jesus, they have dirtied the very name of this
beautiful man. Trying to prove that he is the greatest wise man in the
world, they have only been able to magnify his defects and nothing
else.</p><p>That's why Atmada writes to me that he was an idiot. I know that he
was, but that is how a wise man always is.</p><p>That point has to be understood. A really wise man is a synthesis of
whatever you call wisdom, and idiocy. He is as simple as an idiot and as
complex as any wise man can be.</p><p>You can look at him from both sides. If you look at him from one
side. he will look like an idiot. You can find in Jesus all the things
that you can find in idiots.</p><p>Read Feodor Dostoevski's book, THE IDIOT. It is about an idiot, but
in that idiot you will find all the beautiful qualities that Jesus has:
the innocence, the quality of no-mind, the quality of trust. Never a
doubt arises. These are all idiotic qualities. You call a man an idiot
if he trusts everybody and anybody; you call a man an idiot if you go on
deceiving him and he still goes on trusting you. You go on deceiving him
and he goes on trusting you. You cannot create doubt in him because he
has no mind.</p><p>A man like Jesus is also like an idiot. Not because he has the same
state of idiocy; he has come to the same state from a very different
dimension. the circle is complete: he has again become a child.</p><p>The idiot is below mind, Jesus is above mind -- both are no-minds.
The idiot has got no mind. Jesus and Buddha also have got no minds, but
there is a difference.</p><p>They HAD, and they found out that to have a mind is foolish. They
dropped it: they have become idiots voluntarily. They are not stupid.
They are idiots because they are wise.</p><p>Yes, I know: Jesus, Lao Tzu, Buddha, look like idiots. In India we
have a word</p><p>for the idiot which comes from Buddha. It is BUDDHU. The word is
derived from Buddha himself. Buddha: BUDDHU. BUDDHU means'idiot' and
BUDDHA means'the awakened man'. How can both these words be
together?</p><p>When Buddha died, his impact was tremendous. Thousands and thousands
of people became followers. Thousands and thousands of people were
sitting under Bodhi trees with closed eyes, meditating. People would
call to them:</p><p>"BUDDHUS, go home! What are you doing? Don't be a BUDDHU. Do
something, go home. Your wife is suffering, your children are hungry.
Don't be an idiot! Don't be a BUDDHU!"</p><p>I know, Jesus is so innocent that he looks foolish. But that
foolishness is tremendously precious.</p><p>I am also idiotic, Atmada. And whatsoever I am teaching is teaching
you to be so simple and trusting that you also become idiots in a sense.
But that idiocy is the supreme awareness, that idiocy is supreme wisdom.
Polarities meet: dualities disappear.</p><p>In a Jesus, you will always find a paradox: he's opposites together.
You will find in him qualities which are feminine, you will find in him
qualities which are absolutely male. They meet and mingle, and they have
become one. In him, the feminine and the male have become one; the wise
man and the fool have become one. The polarities have disappeared. The
contradiction is no more a contradiction; it is a synthesis.</p><p>Difficult for the mind to understand. The mind is a doubter the mind
is skeptical. And the mind thinks that it is very intelligent. Mind is
stupid, mind is mediocre.</p><p>It has nothing to do with intelligence. Intelligence is a totally
different flowering of your being; it has nothing to do with mind. Mind
is just a mechanism; it is a computer, a bio-computer. Very complex, but
still a mechanism. It has nothing to do with intelligence.</p><p>Intelligence comes within you only when you have become so
unidentified with the mind that you can see that mind is separate and
you are separate. In that state, intelligence happens. That intelligence
will be both wise and foolish.</p><p>That is the mystery of a Jesus. That is the paradox, the poetry.
Question 5</p><p>THE PEAKS ARE GETTING PRETTY WONDERFUL, BUT THE VALLEYS ARE</p><p>DEEPER AND DARKER THAN EVER. FINDING BALANCE SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE. WHAT
TO DO?</p><p>There is no need to do anything. You are not to find balance, balance
will find you. You simply move. When the valley comes, you go into the
valley. When darkness surrounds you, enjoy it, feel blissful in the
velvety touch of it. Move into it, into the infinite magnificence of it.
Darkness has a soothing quality which no light can have. The valley is a
rest: like the night, like death.</p><p>No need to try to find balance. The balance will find you. You simply
move into the valley. When the valley comes, you accept it. You not only
accept it, you welcome it. You enjoy it, you delight in it -- darkness
is beautiful. And when the valley goes and you move towards the peak,
that too is perfectly beautiful. That is beautiful: the light, the
morning, the sun.</p><p>But don't cling to either. Clinging creates trouble; through
clinging, anguish comes. If you cling to the peak and you say, "I would
not like to go to the valley again," then you will be in trouble. Then
at the very peak you have created the valley. Then, already, the
suffering has started. You are afraid: fear has entered, the agony is
already there. You are no longer happy. You have destroyed the peak.</p><p>When you are in the valley you will suffer that "now the valley has
come." You will suffer the valley, and you will not be able to enjoy the
peak. This is the ordinary situation.</p><p>When you are happy, you become afraid. Is this happiness going to
stay or will it be gone? Now fear eats away at your happiness like a
worm and poisons it. You are happy and yet you are not happy. Something
is already dead: you have become apprehensive of the future. When you
are unhappy, of course, you are unhappy. When you are happy you cannot
be happy, so how can you be happy when you are unhappy? The whole life
becomes a vicious circle of unhappiness.</p><p>Now, listen! When you are at the peak, dance. I know, and you know,
that the peak is not going to last forever. There is no need. If it
lasts forever, it will be such a tension that you will not be able to
tolerate it. It will be such an excitement that you will not find any
rest in it. It will be dangerous, it will kill you. No need for it to
last forever. But while it lasts, dance, enjoy, sing -- knowing well
that it is going to he lost again. Knowing it, one has to enjoy it even
more before it is lost.</p><p>And remember, this is the miracle: when you enjoy it more it lasts
longer. When you are happy in it and dancing, it forgets to go away from
you. It lingers with you. When YOU don't cling to it, it clings to you.
This is the whole secret.</p><p>And when it is gone, then too it is not gone. It has given you such a
deep blissfulness that now you go into the valley and you can rest in
darkness. Then the valley becomes relaxation and the peak becomes
enjoyment. Then the peak becomes the day and the valley becomes the
night: then the peak becomes activity and the valley becomes
passivity.</p><p>One has to enjoy the night also. That is the only way to enjoy the
day. And if you enjoy the day, a great night comes with great rest. It
refreshes you, rejuvenates you.</p><p>Always remember: the greater the peak, the greater will be the
valley. Otherwise how can the peak be greater? If you go to the
Himalayas you will find that the greater the peak the greater the
valley. If you are afraid of the valley, then don't ask for the peaks.
Then move on plain ground. There will be no peak and no valley.</p><p>That is the most miserable life: where there is no peak, no valley.
One simply vegetates. It is not a life. One simply drags. It is a
monotony. It is not a dialogue; it is a monologue. A dialogue needs
duality, a dialogue needs contradiction, a dialogue needs polarity, a
dialogue needs paradox. And within the paradox, you move from one pole
to another.</p><p>Don't be worried about balance. Balance will seek you; I will see
that balance seeks you. You simply do this much: while on the peak,
dance; while in the valley, rest. Accept the valley; accept the peak.
Both are parts of the one whole and you cannot deny one part. They are
two aspects of the same coin.</p><p>Remember, one who enjoys more is bound to suffer more because he
becomes</p><p>very sensitive. But suffering is not bad. If you understand it
rightly, suffering is a cleansing. If you understand it rightly, sadness
has a depth to it which no happiness can ever have. A person who is
simply happy is always superficial. A person who has not known sorrow
and has not known sadness, has not known the depths. He has not touched
the bottom of his being; he has remained just on the periphery. One has
to move within these two banks. Within these two banks flows the
river.</p><p>And I tell you, balance will seek you if you accept both and you live
both.</p><p>Whatsoever happens, you welcome it. Suddenly. one day you will see
that balance has come. And when balance comes to you, it is something
totally different than that balance which you can force upon
yourself.</p><p>If you force the balance, it will be a.sort of control. A control is
always artificial, a control is always ugly. Control has a violence in
it. It is forced, artificial. When balance comes to you, it is a
happening. Suddenly it descends on you. Heavens open and the spirit of
God, like a dove, descends in you.</p><p>All that is great always comes. All that YOU make is always small,
petty. It is never great. All that you do is going to be lesser than
you. All that is great -- you have to allow it. Balance will find you.
God will find you. You just be ready.</p><p>And this is readiness: to accept whatsoever comes, to accept it with
gratefulness. Even sorrow, even sadness. even the valley... dark.</p><p>Question 6</p><p>OSHO, THE OTHER DAY YOU LOVINGLY TOLD ME TO BE MORE</p><p>CONCERNED ABOUT MYSELF AND LESS ABOUT OTHERS. THANK YOU</p><p>OSHO. I GOT THE POINT. AND YET I MUST ASK ONE MORE QUESTION</p><p>NOT TO DO WITH ME BUT WITH YOU. WHAT EXACTLY IS HAPPENING</p><p>WITH YOU? EVERY MONTH YOUR BODY IS BECOMING MORE SENSITIVE</p><p>IN EVERY WAY AND THE PHENOMENON. EVEN TO MY STATE OF</p><p>UNAWARENESS, IS AWESOME. CAN YOU SAY SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR</p><p>CHANGES?</p><p>This is from Chaitanya Sagar. Good that he says this is the last
question that he is asking not about himself!</p><p>I can understand your worry, your concern. The fact is simple. After
the age of thirty-five life starts declining. Thirty-five is the peak:
if you are going to live for seventy years, thirty-five is the peak.
After thirty-five you start declining. It is now downhill.</p><p>If somebody becomes enlightened after thirty-five -- as Buddha became
at forty, Mahavir became at forty -- then he can live a little longer,
because he was already downhill. Enlightenment will not disturb the body
more than it was already disturbed.</p><p>If you become enlightened before the age of thirty-five then there is
danger.</p><p>Shankara became enlightened before the age of thirty-five. He died at
thirty- three. When you are going uphill and life is moving strong --
and you become enlightened -- the connection between you and the body is
disrupted. It has almost always happened that people who have become
enlightened before thirty- five have not survived up to thirty-five.
Difficult. The body and you become so separate that the uphill task
becomes very difficult.</p><p>It is just like: you were going uphill and suddenly you see that
there is no more petrol in the tank of the car. The uphill task becomes
almost impossible. Now you get out and you have to push the car uphill.
Very difficult. But if you become aware when the car is going downhill
that there is no more petrol, there is no trouble. In fact. there is no
need for petrol. The car can go without petrol.</p><p>Shankara died at thirty-three. Buddha lived up to eighty; Mahavir
also lived up to eighty. It has to be understood. I should have died
before thirty-five in fact.</p><p>Somehow I have been pulling. That'somehow' can be understood.</p><p>I have dropped out of life by and by; I have dropped all activity.
Whatsoever energy my body has, I am using for you, that's all. Otherwise
I have dropped all activity: stopped moving, stopped travelling -- I
have almost stopped everything.</p><p>I come out just to see you in the morning and in the evening.
Otherwise I have become completely inactive. absolutely passive.
Whatsoever small energy is there, I am using it as economically as
possible.</p><p>So every day my body is going to become more and more fragile, more
and more sensitive. My ship is ready -- any moment I can depart. I am
lingering on the bank for you a little while more. That's why I'm in a
hurry. You have time to ask useless questions. I don't have time to
answer them.</p><p>You have time to waste. My time is finished. So if you really want to
use this opportunity, don't miss a single moment. Don't hesitate, and
don't put your halfheart in the effort. When I am gone, you will repent
and you will be very sorry, but then nothing can be done. While I am
still here, use every opportunity that I am giving to you and don't
waste a single moment. I HAVE what you are seeking. I can pour it into
you, but your cup is not ready.</p><p>The thing is like this: you come to me and I have a full kettle of
tea. And you are thirsty. I would like to give it to you, but I cannot
pour it in your hands. It will burn you. I have to wait, because you
will have to produce your cup. And that cup can be produced only from
your innermost core of being.</p><p>Only your innermost being can become the cup. Only then can I pour
whatsoever I have got. I am waiting for you so that you can produce the
cup.</p><p>You are thirsty I know, and I have that which can quench your thirst,
but the cup is not ready.</p><p>So don't ask such questions. Rather, look at me and try to
understand.</p><p>Just the other night one sannyasin was saying, "How can you help us
when you yourself are not well in the body?" True. If I am not well in
the body, how can I help you? Looks absolutely logical. But do you know:
was Buddha well in the body?</p><p>No enlightened person has ever been well in the body -- cannot be! --
because the being with the body is disrupted, the bridge is broken. The
body goes on moving on its own, and the being goes on residing in it,
but the energy that was given by the identification is not given.</p><p>You live as one with your body. I live as two. My body is just like
my clothes -- absolutely separate. It is a miracle that it is
functioning.</p><p>Buddha had to keep a physician continuously with him because every
moment was danger. The physician was not for HIM. His work was done; he
had achieved. The physician was for those who were still thirsty. He had
something which could quench their thirst. The physician was for
them.</p><p>If the doctor comes to see me, it is not for me. It is for you. If I
see that there is no point and I cannot help you, this very moment I can
disappear.</p><p>But many of you are working hard. I have the largest number of
sannyasins that is possible in this twentieth-century world: almost
fifteen thousand all around the world. They are all working hard. If
they can succeed, we will release one of the greatest energies.
spiritual energies, in the world.</p><p>I have to wait, and I have to linger on -- whatsoever the body says.
The body says: "It is time, the ship is ready. You can go." The house is
ready to collapse, but I am holding it.</p><p>Don't waste my time in anything. Use it if you can. This is the
trouble: that you may not understand now, but later on, when you
understand, I will not be there.</p><p>Then that understanding will not be of much help. It will simply give
you deep anguish. and sorrow, and agony.</p><p>While I am here, it you understand me, it can become your ecstasy.
When I am gone, it will be just an agony.</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;line-height:192%;text-align:left id=come-follow-to-you-vol-2-chapter-9>Come Follow To You, Vol 2

THE WHICH WHEN A MAN HATH FOUND, HE HIDETH, AND FOR</p><p>JOY THEREOF GOETH AND SELLETH ALL THAT HE HATH, AND BUYETH</p><p>THAT FIELD.</p><p>THE OTHER DAY I WAS READING a few lines of Stephen Crane's. I would
like to read them to you:</p><p>A man said to the universe, "Sir, I exist."</p><p>"However," replied the universe, "the fact has not created in me a
sense of obligation."</p><p>Man can exist in two ways. One, that the whole celebrates him; one,
that the whole welcomes him; one, that the whole feels blessed because
of him -- and the other, that the whole feels cursed.</p><p>Man can live a life of goodness, truth and beauty; and man can live a
life of untruth, evil and ugliness. Man is free to live and to choose.
Man is a tremendous freedom; that is his innermost nature. Nothing is
forced. Hence the beauty of the adventure, and hence the danger also.
You have to choose. Your choice will determine your being, your choice
will become your destiny. On each step, every moment, you have to decide
who you are.</p><p>People come to me and they ask who they are. It is not a question of
inquiry because the being is not a static thing waiting to be discovered
by you. The being has to be created moment to moment. That is the only
way to discover it.</p><p>You create yourself moment to moment. You are not born as a fixed
entity, but only as a infinite potentiality. You are born as a seed, not
as a tree. You are born open, not closed. That opening is tremendous.
You will have to choose every moment who you are going to be. Your
decision is your destiny. And unless you live life so that the whole
feels blessed, you are not religious.</p><p>A religious life is a life of spontaneity. A religious life is a life
of flow, of dynamism. A religious life is a life of prayer.</p><p>Prayer is the supreme good. Let me explain to you what prayer is.</p><p>It is not something that you do; it has nothing to do with doing. It
is something that you become, by and by. It is something that you live;
it is something that surrounds you like a climate. It is something like
a deep gratitude. Looking at the trees, or looking at the sea, or
looking at the grass, a tremendous urge arises in you to say thank you.
That is prayer.</p><p>Not that you say it. It is not in the saying but in the very urge, in
the very mood that you would like to say, unconditionally: "Thank you."
Not knowing to whom your thank-you is addressed... not knowing who is
the creator of the morning, and the evening, and the stars, and the
moon, and the sun... not knowing whose hands are hidden behind every
grass-leaf and who is smiling in every dewdrop -</p><p>- not knowing at all.</p><p>Knowledge is ugly; not knowing is beautiful. Remember, not knowing is
not ignorance. Not knowing is ultimate knowledge. It transcends even
what you call knowledge. Not knowing is innocence. In deep innocence, a
thank-you arises; unaddressed, not knowing to whom you are addressing.
But that is not the point.</p><p>Deep within your being, in your depths, you feel gratitude.</p><p>Prayer is the feeling of the unknown presence. That feeling of the
unknown presence becomes reverence. And prayer has to be just like
breathing. It is not that you do it and you are finished with it. It is
something that goes on and on and on like breathing. Awake or asleep, it
surrounds you; it throbs within your</p><p>heart. It becomes almost YOU; there exists no separation.</p><p>A life of prayer is what I call a good life. A life of gratitude is
what I call a religious life.</p><p>This life of spontaneity, of flow, does not know what sin is. Sin
comes from knowledge. That is the meaning of the Biblical story. When
Adam ate the fruit of the tree of knowledge, he sinned. Then he was
thrown out of the Garden of Eden.</p><p>This story has no parallel, this story is simply unique. BECAUSE he
ate the fruit of the tree of knowledge.…</p><p>No other religion has emphasized, in such a crystal clear way, that
knowledge is sin and unless you become like children again, you will not
become good. Unless you again drop all knowledge and you become
innocent, uncorrupted by knowledge, you will not be accepted back. The
source will go on rejecting you.</p><p>Not that the source wants to reject you. But the way you behave,
through knowledge, you create the situation for your own rejection. God
has to expel Adam and Eve. Not that He wanted to -- He must have wept,
because they were His children -- but He was helpless.</p><p>Whenever you create the feeling of helplessness in the whole, you
commit sin.</p><p>Whenever you force the whole to reject you, you commit sin. Whenever
you force the whole to throw you out of the garden, you commit sin.</p><p>Sin is behaving in a cunning way, behaving as if you know. Sin is to
be self- complacent, sin is to think that you are enough unto yourself.
A child is not enough unto himself, a child is helpless. A child does
not know anything; he acts out of innocence. Then it is good. The moment
you start acting out of knowledge, it is sin.</p><p>Try to understand the import of what I'm saying. I'm saying that if,
out of knowledge, you live a virtuous life, it is not virtuous. You can
have character out of knowledge, you can have a quality of morality out
of knowledge, but then it is not moral'When you are still eating the
fruit or the tree of knowledge.</p><p>Deep down, your so-called saints are sinners, because they still go
on getting</p><p>nourishment from the tree of knowledge. The real sage is innocent. He
acts -- but not because of the commandments, because all commandments
are sin. He acts out of his totality; he responds in the moment.</p><p>He does not act out of the mind. To act out of the mind is to sin, to
act out of the mind is to be thrown out of the garden, out of the
kingdom of God. Once you accept the mind as your source of activity, you
have denied God. And in your denial of God, you are denied.</p><p>Whenever you act out of the mind your act is going to be fragmented,
because mind is a split phenomenon. Mind is not one: it is many, it is a
multitude. Its names are legion. Whenever you act out of the mind, only
a part acts -- against the whole. Whenever you act out of no-mind.…</p><p>Sometimes you act -- you know that there are moments when you act out
of no- mind. You are walking. You have gone for a long morning walk or
evening walk.</p><p>and suddenly a snake crosses the path. You don't have time to think.
Mind needs time; mind is a time process. You don't have time to think.
If you think, you will be finished! The snake is there and the snake is
not going to wait for you to think.</p><p>The snake acts out of no-mind; you will be in danger if you believe
in mind. But you will act out of no-mind. You will simply jump.</p><p>Remember -- and watch! You will jump first, and then you will think
about what has happened. That jump comes out of your totality; it is not
of the mind. That jump is a spontaneous total. It is here and now. It
has nothing to do with past, nothing to do with future. It has no past,
no future. it is absolutely here, now.</p><p>The duality of good is the quality of an act which comes out of your
totality. You fall in love: you see a man or a woman and suddenly, in
spite of you, something happens. Your total being responds in a new way.
Even you are surprised! You throb, you sing, you have a dance within
you, as if clouds have separated and you have seen the source of light.
In a single moment.… In fact, that moment is not a part of time. In
fact, it is a'no moment' -- as if time has stopped. Something has taken
possession of you. This is out of no-mind.</p><p>Whatsoever is like love is good. That's why Jesus says, "God is
love." He's not.saying that God is loving. He's simply showing a
quality: that God has the</p><p>same quality as love.'Good' is love; good has the same quality as
love.</p><p>All that comes from the mind is from the devil -- DEVIL is just a way
of saying it</p><p>-- because the mind separates. Let mc define devil as one who
separates, and God as one who unites. God and devil are both ways of
speaking. They are not entities, they are symbols.</p><p>Just a few days before, I read a beautiful story of DuBois'. I would
like you to listen to it and try to understand it:</p><p>It was one o'clock and I was hungry. I walked into a restaurant,
seated myself, and reached for the bill of fare. My table companion
rose. "Sir," said he, "do you wish to force your company on those who
don't want you?"</p><p>"No," I said. "I wish to eat."</p><p>"Are you aware, sir, that this is social equality?" "Nothing of the
sort, sir. It is hunger," I said, and I ate.</p><p>The day's work done, I sought the theater. As I sank into my seat,
the lady next to me shrank and squirmed. "I beg pardon," I said.</p><p>"Do you enjoy where you're not wanted?" she asked coldly. "Oh, no," I
said.</p><p>"Well, you are not wanted here."</p><p>I was surprised. "I fear you are mistaken," I said. "I certainly want
the music, and I like to think the music wants me to listen to it."</p><p>"Oh sir," said the lady, "this is social equality."</p><p>"No, madam," said the usher. "It is the second movement of
Beethoven's Fifth Symphony."</p><p>After the theater, I sought the hotel where I had sent my baggage.
The clerk scowled. "What do you want?"</p><p>"Rest," I said.</p><p>"This is a white hotel," he said.</p><p>I looked around. "Such a color scheme requires a great deal of
cleaning," I said. "But I don't know that I object."</p><p>"We object! " said he.</p><p>"Then why -- " I began, but he interrupted.</p><p>"We don't keep niggers," he said. "We don't want social equality."
"Neither do I," I replied gently. "I want a bed."</p><p>I walked thoughtfully to the train. "I will take a sleeper though
Texas. I'm a little bit dissatisfied with this town."</p><p>"Can't sell you one."</p><p>"I only want to hire it," said I, "for a couple of nights."</p><p>"Can't sell you a sleeper in Texas," he maintained. "They consider
that social equality."</p><p>"I consider it barbarism," I said, "and I think I will walk."</p><p>Walking, I met another wayfarer who immediately walked to the other
side of the road where it was very muddy. I asked his reason.</p><p>"Niggers is dirty," he said.</p><p>"So is mud," said I. "Moreover, I am not as dirty as you, vet." "But
you are a nigger, aren't you?" he asked.</p><p>"My grandfather was so called."</p><p>"Well then?" he answered triumphantly.</p><p>"Do you live in the south?" I persisted pleasantly. "Sure," he
growled. "And starve there."</p><p>"I should think that you and the Negroes should get together and vote
out starvation."</p><p>"We don't let them vote! We?" "Why not?" I said in surprise. "Niggers
is too ignorant to vote."</p><p>"But," I said,'I am not so ignorant as you." "But you are a
nigger?"</p><p>"Yes, I am certainly what you mean by that."</p><p>"Well then?" he returned with that curiously inconsequential note of
triumph. "Moreover," he said, "I don't want my sister to marry a
nigger."</p><p>I had not seen his sister, so I merely murmured, "Let her say no."
"By God, you shall not marry her even if she said yes!"</p><p>"But I don't want to marry her," I answered, a little perturbed at
the personal turn.</p><p>"Why not?" he yelled, angrier than ever.</p><p>"Because I am already married. And I rather like my wife." "Is she a
nigger?" he asked suspiciously.</p><p>"Well," I said again, "her grandmother was called that." "Well then?"
he shouted in that oddly illogical way.</p><p>I gave up. "Go on," I said, "either you are crazy or I am."</p><p>"We both are," he said as he trotted along in the mud.</p><p>Mind is crazy; mind is mad. Mind creates divisions, fragments. Mind
creates nations, races -- white and black, poor and rich. Mind is the
devil. When you can feel that you are one with all, you have gone beyond
mind. To feel one with all, to feel a unison, is to be good. And to act
out of that oneness is to be religious.</p><p>A religious man has no character. A religious man has a spontaneity.
A religious man has a moment to moment contact with the whole. That
contact is never lost.</p><p>He lives prayerfully. A nonreligious man may be apparently good,
moral, he may have a character, but he is frozen, dead. He acts out of
that character: out of the mind, out of knowledge, out of rules. He is
never in contact with the whole; he is always out of step. That's what I
call'devil'; that's what I call'bad'.</p><p>And that's what Jesus means by this parable. He has not been
understood, he has been very much misunderstood. But if you can carry
this feeling of what good is and what bad is, you will be able to go
deep into this parable.</p><p>ALL THESE THINGS SPAKE JESUS UNTO THE MULTITUDE IN PARABLES; AND
WITHOUT A PARABLE SPAKE HE NOT UNTO THEM:</p><p>THEN JESUS SENT THE MULTITUDE AWAY, AND WENT INTO THE</p><p>HOUSE: AND HIS DISCIPLES CAME UNTO HIM, SAYING, DEC]ARE UNTO</p><p>US THE PARABLE OF THE TARES OF THE FIELD.</p><p>Jesus always talked in parables. A parable is a poetic way of saying
things which cannot be said in prose. It is a very feeling way of saying
things from the heart --</p><p>things which cannot be expressed by the head. A parable is a way of
talking in pictures, not in words.</p><p>Have you ever observed that children always understand pictures?
That's why, in children's books, you have to have many colored pictures.
Text, not much; pictures, many. First they understand the pictures, and
then they understand the text.</p><p>In your dreams, you are again living in parables. You have pictures
and pictures and pictures -- the text is not much. Your unconscious
understands only pictures.</p><p>Your conscious has become trained for language, words, but your
unconscious is still that of a child.</p><p>When Jesus, a man like Jesus, is talking, he is trying to bridge
something between himself and your unconscious. He is not a preacher.
When a preacher talks to you, he talks in concepts. He is trying to
communicate from one head to another head. When a man like Jesus, Buddha
or Zarathustra talks, he is trying to communicate something from his
innermost depth to your innermost depth. He always uses parables.</p><p>A parable becomes a picture. Logic is not needed to understand it. If
you can love sympathetically, that will do: if you can listen
sympathetically, that will do.</p><p>If you can listen in deep trust, that is enough: no logic is needed.
The parable will manifest itself, will surround you, will become part of
your being. You may forget the message, but you will never forget the
parable. It will be deeply imprinted it will remain within you forever
and ever. Stories have a way of penetrating to the innermost core.</p><p>ALL THESE THINGS SPAKE JESUS UNTO THE MULTITUDE IN PARABLES; AND
WITHOUT A PARABLE SPAKE HE NOT UNTO THEM:</p><p>THEN JESUS SENT THIS MULTITUDE AWAY. AND WENT INTO THE</p><p>HOUSE: AND HIS DISCIPLES CAME UNTO HIM, SAYING, DECLARE UNTO</p><p>US THE PARABLE OF THE TARES OF THE FIELD.</p><p>He must have used that parable with the multitude, with the crowd.
The disciples wanted to know what he means. The disciples wanted to know

THEIR FATHER. WHO HATH EARS TO HEAR, LET HIM HEAR.</p><p>A simple parable, but very significant. Move step by step into it: HE
THAT SOWETH THE GOOD SEED IS THE SON OF MAN.</p><p>THE SON OF MAN has a very particular meaning in the Jewish
literature. It is used only for the prophets. Ordinarily, whomsoever you
call human beings are not yet human beings. They have the potentiality
to be, but they have not actualized it. They are just like seeds. They
have not yet sprouted, they have not yet bloomed. Their fragrance is
just a possibility; it is not yet actual.</p><p>Jews call a man'son of man' if he has become perfectly actualized:
the perfect man. He is no more just potential. He has bloomed, flowered.
'The son of man'</p><p>is a very, very respectful expression. It is next only to'son of
God'. And unless you become son of man, you will not be able to become
son of God. First become actualized human beings: real, authentic, true.
Then the next step becomes possible. Then you can transcend humanity and
you can become son of God.</p><p>Again and again, Jesus uses for himself'son of man' -- more than he
ever uses'son of God'. Rarely does he use'son of God' -- often he uses
the expression'son of man' -- because for those who have not become even
human beings, the son of God is a myth. They cannot understand it. You
can understand only that which has become in some way actual within you;
you can understand only that which has become part of you.</p><p>You are part-human beings. When Jesus says'son of man', at least a
part within you can respond that yes, he is true. A part within you can
trust him. But when he says'son of God', he's moving in some direction
about which you are completely oblivious. You have not known it, you
have not even heard about it.</p><p>It makes no sense to you.</p><p>So he uses the expression'son of God' only very rarely, only with
very close disciples who are growing, by and by, into divinity; whose
hands are touching the divine, who have been groping and now they have
come to the door; who have attained a small glimpse of the ultimate.
Only then he uses'son of God'.</p><p>Otherwise he says'son of man'.</p><p>HE ANSWERED AND SAID UNTO THEM, HE THAT SOWETH THE GOOD</p><p>SEED IS THE SON OF MAN.</p><p>One who has become actualized, one who has become really human -- how
will you know him? Because this crystallization will be his innermost
phenomenon, you will not be able to see it. You will not be able to look
within him: you will not be able to understand what has happened within
him. That will remain a mystery to you, it will remain hidden. But one
thing you can watch, one thing</p><p>you can see and understand, and that is: HE THAT SOWETH THE GOOD
SEED</p><p>IS THE SON OF MAN.</p><p>You will see through his acts, through his words, even through his
gestures, that he is sowing the seed of good. Whatsoever he does,
howsoever he moves -- even walking. sitting, sleeping -- he is
continuously sowing seeds of good. His whole life is nothing but a
showering of good seeds all around. Wherever he moves, he goes on sowing
good seeds.</p><p>Not that he thinks about it deliberately, not that he plans about it,
not that he makes any effort about it, not that he has become very
skilled in a certain discipline -- no. Spontaneously He cannot help it.
That's how he is. That's how</p><p>it happens to him; that's how his whole being functions now.
Goodness/good deeds/good is the functioning of one who has become
actualized.</p><p>Remember, you have been taught just the opposite. You have been
taught: become good in your acts, so that you can realize yourself. That
is wrong; that is looking at the thing from the wrong end. The real
teachers have not said that.</p><p>They have said just the opposite. They have said: become actualized.
and you will find that your acts have become good.</p><p>The character is not to be cultivated. A cultivated character is
immoral, howsoever moral it appears. A cultivated character is a
bondage, it is an imprisonment. and whomsoever you call men of character
are all frozen: dead people, blocked. They need to be melted so that
they can flow again.</p><p>They may be good, but they stink. They may be good, but it is very
difficult to live with them. They may be good, but they are very
paralyzing to others --</p><p>crippling. If you live with them, they will become a heavy weight on
your chest. They will c rush you and destroy you. They are
destructive.</p><p>When you are really in contact with a good man, a good man whose
goodness is not forced and cultivated, but one who has realized his
potentiality and now the goodness flows It is just like the fragrance of
a flower which ha.s opened.</p><p>When the flower opens, the fragrance spreads. Not otherwise.
Otherwise you call just have a plastic flower that you can spray with
perfume. A character that has to be maintained, controlled, is like
sprayed perfume. The flower is not real.</p><p>Jesus says: HE THAT SOWETH THE GOOD SEED IS THE SON OF MAN.</p><p>Recognize that he is the son of man. You will be able to know it from
his acts. He does not act through morality, through discipline. He acts
out of his heart. You cannot see his heart without seeing his acts. That
is your blindness.</p><p>And never try to follow the acts of good people. That's how the whole
world has become almost dead -- a great graveyard. I was just reading a
few days before that Paul, St. Paul, said to his people: "I imitate
Christ. You imitate me. That is the way."</p><p>This is dangerous teaching. This man Paul has completely
misunderstood. He says "I imitate Christ. You imitate me." He says: "Do
whatsoever I do. That's the way." These are the people who destroy the
message of Christ completely.</p><p>If you imitate, you will remain false. You may become Christ-like,
but you will not be a Christ. You may become Buddha-like, but you will
not be a Buddha, You will be just a pseudo-Buddha, a false thing, an
untrue thing. That is not going to make you blissful, and that is not
going to create a sense of obligation in existence.</p><p>HE ANSWERED AND SAID UNTO THEM, HE THAT SOWETH THE GOOD</p><p>SEED IS THE SON OF MAN. This is the way you will recognize him,
that's all.</p><p>THE FIELD IS THE WORLD; THE GOOD SEED ARE THE CHILDREN OF THE</p><p>KINGDOM; BUT THE TARES ARE THE CHILDREN OF THE WICKED ONE.</p><p>How to translate this WICKED ONE -- the devil, the beelzebub, the
satan -- into today's twentieth-century language? I call it: the
mind.</p><p>Buddha is more modern, more contemporary than Jesus. Buddha will
never say</p><p>this. He will say the mind corrupts, not the devil.'Devil' is a
symbolic way of saying the same thing.</p><p>But dangerous. Because then in Christianity, the devil became very,
very important; and in the Christian mind, the devil became a reality.
God also became a personalized reality. They are not persons; they are
both interpretations of a certain inner phenomenon.</p><p>the inner phenomenon is that your being can function in two ways:
either through the mind or through the no-mind. If you work through the
mind, that is what Jesus calls THE WICKED ONE. If you work through the
no mind, then you function through your nature. That's what Buddha calls
nirvana: selflessness, ANATTA, enlightenment.</p><p>You are separate from the mind. Once you know how to function without
the mind, how to bypass it, how to put the mind aside, then you are
functioning in the totality, WITH the totality. Then you are in tune
with it. Then you are not like an island. You have surrendered and you
have become part of the mainland, the continent. Then you are not
separate from existence. It is not that YOU exist: then God exists in
you. Then the ego has disappeared like a dewdrop in the morning sun.</p><p>THE FIELD IS THE WORLD; THE GOOD SEED ARE THE CHILDREN OF THE</p><p>KINGDOM; BUT THE TARES ARE THE CHILDREN OF THE WICKED ONE: THE ENEMY
THAT SOWED THEM IS THE DEVIL --</p><p>The devil is not outside you. It is very tempting to think of him as
outside, because then you can throw all the responsibility on him and
you can become completely free of the responsibility. People have always
been using scapegoats to throw their responsibilities on.</p><p>Whatsoever is wrong with you, you will always find some cause for it
in somebody else. Somebody says something and you feel angry. Now you
think that he has insulted you. In fact, you have become angered -- not
that he has insulted you. If you were a little more aware, there would
have been no anger, and then there would have been no insult either.</p><p>You throw responsibility. One feels good just putting the
responsibility on others'</p><p>shoulders. This is one of the oldest ways that the human mind has
always been defending itself. Once you can say and argue that somebody
else is responsible, you can relax and you can be yourself, whatsoever
you are. There is no need to transform yourself.</p><p>But if you see that the devil is within and that there is no point in
throwing out the responsibility on somebody else -- you are the problem
-- then to live with the problem becomes difficult. To live with the
problem becomes almost impossible. A moment comes when you have to drop
it; it is too much. It is foolish and stupid to carry it. You are not
benefitted by it; you are simply crushed under the weight.</p><p>Never throw the responsibility on some devil outside. The devil is
within -- as much within as God is within. If you function through the
mind, this is the devil.</p><p>If you function without mind -- if you function through meditation,
no-mind -- it is God. God is a function of you. The devil is also a
function of you.</p><p>If you function unaware, unalert, not remembering yourself, you have
allowed the devil to enter in you. And remember, I am not being
anthropomorphic at all.</p><p>There is nobody outside who enters within you. These are only ways of
speaking.</p><p>THE ENEMY THAT SOWED THEM IS THE DEVIL; THE HARVEST IS THE</p><p>END OF THE WORLD; AND THE REAPERS ARE THE ANGELS.</p><p>AS THEREFORE THE TARES ARE GATHERED AND BURNED IN THE FIRE; SO SHALL
IT BE IN THE END OF THIS WORLD.</p><p>THE SON OF MAN SHALL SEND FORTH HIS ANGELS, AND THEY SHALL</p><p>GATHER OUT OF HIS KINGDOM ALL THINGS THAT OFFEND, AND THEM</p><p>WHICH DO INIQUITY;</p><p>AND SHALL CAST THEM INTO A FURNACE OF FIRE: THERE SHALL BE</p><p>WAILING AND GNASHING OF TEETH.</p><p>THEN SHALL THE RIGHTEOUS SHINE FORTH AS THE SUN IN THE KINGDOM OF
THEIR FATHER. WHO HATH EARS TO HEAR, LET HIM HEAR.</p><p>Jesus is saying that the good survives and the bad dies. Jesus is
saying that the good is eternal and the bad temporary. Jesus is saying
that the good remains and the bad is momentary. This has to be
understood.</p><p>Forget his words, they have become out of date. Christians go on
talking about these words and explaining them. The words are dead. What
he says is very significant, and will always remain significant, but the
language has to be changed.</p><p>Listen to how different it sounds if I say: good is that which is to
survive. Maybe temporarily it is defeated, but eventually, finally, it
wins. In India we say:'SATYA MEVA JAYATE... truth wins, eventually.'
Maybe in the moment the lie appears to win, but that cannot be so,
finally. A lie is a lie and will be exposed someday or other. It cannot
become eternity. Just think: how can a lie become eternity? It has no
roots in existence, it has no being of its own. Even if it exists for
the moment, it has no being of its own. Even if it exists for the
moment, it has to borrow its being from some truth.</p><p>That's why, whenever you assert a lie, you defend it. You argue for
it, you try to prove it, and you like to say that "This is truth." You
are trying to borrow being and life from truth... for the lie. But a
borrowed life is a lie. For a moment it may deceive, but it cannot
deceive eternally; it cannot deceive for ever and ever.</p><p>Someday or other, it is bound to be exposed.</p><p>A lie is a lie, and cannot become true. And a truth is a truth, maybe
hidden for the moment, misunderstood -- not heard, heard wrongly,
interpreted wrongly --</p><p>but a truth is a truth. A diamond is a diamond. It may be lost in the
mud, but it is</p><p>not the mud and it cannot become the mud. Finally, it has to be
discovered.</p><p>Truth is eternal. Or, it will be better if we say it just the other
way around: that which is eternal is true.</p><p>Don't cling to anything which is not eternal. Otherwise you are
living with a lie.</p><p>And all the time that you lived with it is simply wasted. The lie
will be exposed and you will find y our hands empty.</p><p>Jesus is saying that, in the end, good survives and all that is bad
dies in fire, is destroyed. So look, watch your life. What are you
sowing? The world is a field, life is an opportunity. What are you
sowing?</p><p>Are you sowing love or are you sowing only lust' If yOU are sowing
only lust, in the end you will come to know. And you will have to repent
much, because that lust was just a momentary fantasy: ungrounded,
without any roots. It was just in the mind. Love? Then you can rely upon
it. Then you are building your house on a rock, not on the sand.</p><p>What are you accumulating in the world? Possessions? things? wealth?
Then you are deceived by the devil: by the mind, by ambition,
desire.</p><p>Or are you trying to realize who you are? The real wealth.'I he only
thing that can be possessed is your being, because you already possess
it. Nothing else can be possessed. If you are searching for one thing
that you can possess and can be yours -- and can be yours for ever and
ever, even death cannot take it away from you -- then you are sowing the
seeds which Jesus calls THE CHILDREN OF THE</p><p>KINGDOM.</p><p>If you are a little alert.… And I hope that you are. Otherwise you
cannot be near me; you cannot be here. A part of you has become alert.
Hence, you are here. A part has become awake. Just watch from that
corner which has become lighted.</p><p>Just look at your past. Do you find anything which can be eternal,
which can be existential for ever and ever? If not, then your life has
been wasted. Don't go on repeating it. Jump out of the vicious circle,
stop that wheel. If you think that yes, there is something which can be
eternal, then water it. Protect it; help it to grow.</p><p>That is how one finds one's religion. It is not found in the Bible,
it is not found in the Gita or Koran. It is found in one's own
experience. Watch, observe, and go on separating the good seeds from the
bad. Before God rejects them, please, you reject them. Don't carry
anything with you that is to be thrown in the fire. Don't carry anything
with you that is going to die.</p><p>It is going to be hard, arduous, to separate yourself from false
things, because you have attached so much significance to false things.
You go on wasting your life for things of no import -- childish.</p><p>A man goes on accumulating wealth. He goes on thinking that someday
in the future he is going to live; right now he is preparing. But that
preparation is never fulfilled. One day, suddenly, he dies. The
accumulated wealth is there and somebody else will become the possessor.
This man wasted his whole life. He could have lived, he could have lived
beautifully -- because, in fact, if you want to live, all that is needed
is already given to you.</p><p>Let me repeat it: if you want to live, all that is needed is already
given to you.</p><p>There is no need to prepare. All preparation is a postponement, all
preparation is a trick of the devil -- the mind. The mind says: how can
you live now? How can you dance? First you need a marble floor; then you
can dance.</p><p>So first have a marble floor. Then you can dance. Do you see the
fallacy in it? If you want to dance, the beach is enough; the earth is
enough. If you want to dance, you can dance anywhere, anytime. Every
moment is as good as any other.</p><p>Nothing else is needed. Only life is needed in you, and that is
there. You need a flowing life, that's all. To dance, that's all that's
needed. Not even a training for dancing is needed. Life itself is the
dance. You just allow it to happen.</p><p>You want to sing? Then for what are you waiting? You want to love?
Then for what are you postponing? This is the only moment there is, and
this is the only life there is. Forget about the future and start being
alive here and now. And remember, if you are alive this moment, the next
moment you will find yourself more alive, because the next moment is
born out of this moment.</p><p>And if you miss this moment, a great punishment is there. Not that
somebody who goes on punishing you is sitting there on a golden throne
in heaven, If you miss this moment and you don't dance, by and by you
lose the capacity to dance.</p><p>That is the punishment. That is the only punishment; there is nobody
who is punishing you.</p><p>If you pray this moment, you are rewarded, because the next moment a
great prayer is waiting. If you don't pray this moment, you lose the
capacity to pray.</p><p>By and by, you become absolutely incapable of praying. Then you go
and ask people how to pray, how to meditate, how to love.</p><p>Just look at the absurdity of the questions: how to love? how to
pray? how to meditate? how to live? Absurd questions... but they show
the poverty, the inner poverty of man. He has been postponing
everything, and by and by he has forgotten. Every child knows how to
Fay, and every child knows how to love, and every child knows how to
dance, and every child knows how to live. Every child comes complete,
with everything ready. One just has to start living.</p><p>Have you seen? If you are crying and a small child is watching, he
will come near you. He cannot say much, he cannot argue you out of your
crying, but he puts his hand on your hand. Have you felt the touch?
Never again will anybody touch you like that, like a child can touch. He
knows how to touch. Later on, people are simply cold, hard. They touch,
but nothing flows from their hands.</p><p>When a child touches you -- the tenderness of it, the softness of it:
the message -</p><p>-</p><p>he pours his whole being in it.</p><p>Everybody is born complete to live. And the more you live, the more
capable you become of life. That is the reward. The less you live, the
less capable you are.</p><p>That is the punishment.</p><p>The religion you have to seek is within you. You have to watch your
life moment to moment and drop all that seems to be momentary. It may be
very exciting, but futile in the end. Drop it! Look deep into those
moments which may not be so exciting. The eternal cannot be very
exciting, because that which has to be for ever and ever has to be very
silent, peaceful. Blissful, of course, but not exciting.</p><p>Deeply blissful, but with no noise around it. More like a silence
than like sound.</p><p>You will have to grow in awareness so you can sort it out. Otherwise,
in the end, you will find that you have lived a futile life. That's what
Jesus calls THE TARES</p><p>OF THE FIELD.</p><p>WHO HATH EARS TO HEAR, LET HIM HEAR.</p><p>AGAIN, THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN IS LIKE UNTO TREASURE HID IN A FIELD;
THE WHICH WHEN A MAN HATH FOUND, HE HIDETH, AND FOR</p><p>JOY THEREOF GOETH AND SELLETH ALL THAT HE HATH, AND BUYETH</p><p>THAT FIELD.</p><p>Yes, that is how it is. Once you come to know the eternal, the
essential, the infinite, once you have come to feel it, then you are
ready to go and sell all that you have been possessing, that you have
been accumulating. Then you are ready to sell everything just to have
this treasure of eternity.</p><p>I will repeat it again:</p><p>AGAIN, THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN IS LIKE UNTO TREASURE HID IN A FIELD;
THE WHICH WHEN A MAN HATH FOUND, HE HIDETH, AND FOR</p><p>JOY THEREOF GOETH AND SELLETH ALL THAT HE HATH, AND BUYETH</p><p>THAT FIELD.</p><p>This is what my sannyas is all about.</p><p>Seek the eternal. Whatsoever the cost, stake all for it and you will
not be a loser. Try to save that which you have accumulated and you will
be lost. Says Jesus: "Those who.save their lives, lose them: and those
who are ready to lose them,</p><p>attain to life -- to life abundant." <strong>Come Follow To You, Vol

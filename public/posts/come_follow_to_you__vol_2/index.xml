‌Chapter title:‌ 1 November 1975 am in Buddha Hall Question 1 &#34;ROSES ARE RED
VIOLETS ARE BLUISH IF IT WASN&#39;T FOR JESUS WE&#39;D ALL BE JEWISH.&#34; PLEASE COMMENT.
WE STILL ARE. Jesus could not succeed. To be Jewish has nothing to do with any race; it is an attitude. To be Jewish means to be calculating, to be under the world of law and not love.</description>

‌Chapter title: Every moment god knocks‌ 9 November 1975 am in Buddha Hall Question 1
HUMPTY DUMPTY SAT ON A WALL HUMPTY DUMPTY HAD A GREAT FALL ALL THE KING&#39;S HORSES AND ALL THE KING&#39;S MEN COULDN&#39;T PUT HUMPTY DUMPTY TOGETHER AGAIN.
IT IS NOT ABOUT HUMPTY DUMPTY, It is about you. It is about humanity, the human mind: the fragmented human mind which is not a unity but has become a crowd -- a crowd fighting amongst itself, a crowd continuously in war.</description>

‌Chapter title: Politics And Love‌ 5 November 1975 am in Buddha Hall Question 1
YOU SAID, &#34;TEACHING IS THE BEST WAY OF LEARNING BUT YOU HAVE
ALSO SAID, &#34;THE WORLD IS IRRELIGIOUS BECAUSE OF TOO MANY
PREACHERS. &#34;WOULD YOU PLEASE SPEAK ON THE SUBTLE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN HELPING OTHERS AND TRYING TO CHANGE OTHERS.
THERE IS A VAST DIFFERENCE, and tremendously significant, between trying to change the other and helping him.</description>

‌Chapter title: The fear of happiness‌ 7 November 1975 am in Buddha Hall Question 1
OSHO, WILL I KNOW WHEN I AM READY TO FACE YOU?
YOU WILL FACE ME; knowledge will come later on. Not the otherwise -- not that knowledge will come first and then you will face me. Knowledge will not precede; reality will precede. Knowledge is a shadow: it follows.</description>

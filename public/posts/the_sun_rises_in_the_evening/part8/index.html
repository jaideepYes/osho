I FIND THAT ALL MY UPSETS, CONFLICTS, TURMOILS, HAVE TO DO WITH THIS DESIRE TO BE SPECIAL AND NOTHING ELSE.\nSUDHA, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO HELP because you are not ordinary – nobody is, nobody can be. Everybody is unique and extraordinary. The problem arises when you start trying to be that which you already are, then you fail. If you were ordinary, there would be no difficulty in attaining to extraordinariness; there would be every possibility. But the fish is in the ocean and is trying to be in the ocean; failure is absolute – it is doomed.\nHow can you be ordinary? This whole existence is extraordinary. Each pebble on the shore is extraordinary, each grass leaf is extraordinary. And I am not only talking about lotuses and roses – of course, they too are extraordinary – but an ordinary grass flower is not ordinary. All that exists is divine, how can it be ordinary?\nDon’t try to be ordinary; otherwise, you will go on failing and you will create misery for yourself. Even I cannot help, even I cannot go against the Tao, against the fundamental law of life. God only creates the extraordinary; this whole existence is special. These raindrops, this morning, the people around you this moment is extraordinary; it can’t be repeated again, no, never – not even in the whole of\neternity can it be repeated again. You will never find these raindrops falling again, this sound, this morning, these people. This whole situation is extraordinary; it only happens once.\nYou will not find another Sudha all around the world. You can go on searching, and not only in the present time, but even in the past or in the future, and no Sudha will ever be repeated. This is how we are. Once you start trying to be extraordinary you will get into difficulty.\nTo accept yourself as you are, and to accept the whole as it is – if you can understand the extraordinariness of everything that is – you have become ordinary.\nSudha, it is not that you want to be extraordinary, you want to be special COMPARED WITH other people. That too is absurdity – no comparison is possible. How can you be compared with anybody? – nobody is like you. You don’t compare a dog with a parrot, or do you? There is no similarity, there is no likeness, how can you compare a dog with a parrot? or a tree with a man? or a rock with a river? In fact, no two individuals are alike, hence they are incomparable. You are you, and the other is other.\nTo understand this is to be both extraordinary and ordinary. Extraordinary in the sense that existence only creates unique people, and ordinary in the sense that everybody is extraordinary. There is nothing extraordinary in being extraordinary; everybody is so. The comparison disappears; and when there is no comparison, there is no possibility of the ego.\nYou ask me: PLEASE HELP ME TO BE HAPPY...\nI can only help you to be not miserable, I cannot help you to be happy. But if you are not miserable, you will be happy. But no direct way is possible to make you happy. If it were possible, I would have made you happy long before now. I am not a miser, I would have given it to you if it were possible to give at all – but there is no possibility.\nHappiness is not something that is going to happen to you from the outside. Once you stop being miserable, happiness is, happiness wells up within your being. It simply arises out of you; you start blooming – the hindrances have been removed.\nAnd this seems to be your greatest obstacle: you want to be extraordinary. I declare it, Sudha, you are. But remember, everybody else is too. So now there is no need to be worried, I certify you; you need not prove it. Let this obstacle disappear. Accept your extraordinariness, rejoice in it, celebrate it. Walt Whitman says ‘I celebrate myself, I sing myself...’ Celebrate and sing. You are extraordinary, God has not made another person like you, will never make another person like you. It is only once that God exists as you, in you, in this form. This form is unrepeatable.\nNow, what is lacking? All your misery is arising because you are trying to become it. It is your being; becoming is irrelevant. And then suddenly you will see... If you can see the point... Don’t think about it, Sudha, just see the point – it is so crystal clear – and a great burden from your chest will disappear. So you are extraordinary! You will take a deep breath, you will relax, and suddenly there is happiness.\nHappiness is not something that we have to produce or do anything for; it is natural, it is spontaneous. I can help you not to be in misery. Misery is your creation, happiness is God’s\ncreation. Misery is the gift that you have given to yourself, happiness is the gift that God has given to you. But you cling to misery, and when you cling, you feed it by your clinging. Drop it. Start dancing and singing and celebrating. End it right now. And don’t say ‘Tomorrow’, because tomorrow never comes. And don’t say ‘I will think it over’; either you have understood or you have missed. Thinking is not going to help. It is a simple fact.\nLet me repeat it again: everybody is extraordinary, so nobody needs to try. Don’t suffer with this unnecessary inferiority. And if you suffer from it, you can go on suffering for ages; you can go on creating, and you can go on finding new ways and means. Somebody has a longer nose than you – you are inferior. Somebody has blond hair – you are inferior. Somebody has those beautiful eyes – and you are inferior. Somebody is more intelligent – and you are inferior. Somebody is a little taller – and you are inferior. If you go on looking and searching for misery, it is available; you can find it in every person that passes by, you will find something or other is missing in you. But this is your way of looking at things that creates misery.\nForget everybody, just look into the gifts that God has given to you, and gratitude arises. In fact, there is no reason, no RAISON D’ETRE for this existence to be, no reason for this rain this morning, for this melody, this beautiful song, that the clouds are singing around you. If it were not there we could not have complained. If it were not there, we could not have asked that it should be. It is simply there without our asking. It is there. We have not even knocked at the door, and the door is open. And millions of gifts are showering on you; just look at those gifts, and you will be surprised. You will be surprised at how you have been missing them. Just the joy of breathing is enough tO be grateful for, just the joy of meeting a friend is enough to be grateful for, just the joy of sitting silently doing nothing... The joy of a morning or an evening, the joy of night... Just go on looking for the joyous, and you will find it.\nYou only find that which you look for.\nYou have been looking for misery; now, you can create misery. Today it is raining and tomorrow it will not be raining, then tomorrow you can be miserable – ‘Why is it not raining today ?’ And when it is raining you are not grateful.\nStart feeling grateful. Happiness comes closer and closer the more and more you become grateful. Gratitude functions like a magnetism; the complaining mind repels happiness – it closes doors. It all depends on you. I can show you the way, but you will have to walk on it. Buddha has said ‘Buddhas can only point the way; they cannot walk for you.’ You will have to walk. I am showing you the way, but you have become very clever, efficient, in creating misery for yourself. Change the direction of your energies; channelize them toward the joy, the beauty... this cuckoo calling from far away. And, slowly slowly, you will see that so many things were there but you were not seeing them. Your eyes were full of misery hence you were missing them. Your eyes were clouded, they were hazy, foggy, that’s why you were missing.\nAnd one can miss by a small margin; one can miss by only a small thought. A small thought can become a barrier and you can miss the whole beauty of the vast Himalayas. You can be there, watching the beautiful peaks of the Himalayas, and the sun falling on the Himalayan snow, showering gold all around, and a thought comes into your mind, and the Himalayas have disappeared, the thought clouds you. You remember something: the other day somebody had insulted you, and that’s\nenough. Or you start planning for the future, ‘Tomorrow I have to leave’, and the Himalayas have disappeared. And the thought is so small, and the Himalayas are so big... But even a small thought can hinder. The thought is so close to you, and it can stand in between. Just a small particle of dust can fall in your eye, and just a small particle – almost invisible – can make you blind, and you cannot open your eyes, and you cannot see the sun shining.\nSudha, do only one thing: start dropping the very concept of inferiority, the very concept that you have to be extraordinary. Now, even this question contains it; she has signed the question... your ORDINARY BUDDHA, SUDHA. Even in that, the ego is claiming that ‘I am no ordinary BUDDHA. I am an ORDINARY Buddha.’ You follow me? ‘Buddhas are extraordinary people; I am not like them – I am an ordinary Buddha.’ This is claiming extraordinariness.\nHELP ME FO BE ORDINARY.\nYou want to be extraordinarily ordinary? The ego can go on playing games, subtle games. You will have to look through and through. Just remember two things. One, you are already that which you want to be, hence there is no need to do anything for it. You can call it ordinariness, you can call it extraordinariness – it makes no difference – you are already that, you can never be anything other than that. What you call it does not matter. If you are in love with the word ‘ordinary’ then everybody is ordinary. If you love the word ‘extraordinary’ then everybody is extraordinary. Remember only one thing, that whatsoever you claim for yourself, you have claimed for the whole. And that is the trouble, you would like to be special, not like everybody else.\nIt happened...\nThere is a beautiful parable...\nA man worshipped God for many years and was always asking ‘Fulfil only one of my desires.’ God must have got tired, bored. One day he appeared and he said ‘Okay, you won’t leave me alone. Morning, evening, you continuously go on harping on the same note “Fulfil one of my desires.” Okay, I am here, what is your desire?’\nAnd the man said ‘Whatsoever I ask should be immediately given to me, that is my desire.’ Very cunning man! God must have thought – out of his innocence – that he would ask for one thing; he asked for it all! He said that he had only one desire that ‘Whatsoever I ask should be given immediately to me.’ But you cannot defeat God, because cunningness never defeats innocence. God said ‘Perfectly okay, this will be so, but remember one thing: whatsoever you ask, your neighbours will get double.’\nNow, the man was finished. Months passed, and God would come again and again. ‘You have not asked anything...?’ He stopped praying, and God would come again and again, morning, evening, and he would say ‘What! You have not asked yet?’ And the man became very bored with God. He thought and thought, but whatsoever he will get, neighbours will get double. ‘It is pointless!’ He always wanted to have a beautiful palace, ‘But what is the point now? The neighbours will have doubly big palaces.’ The very idea was crushing him. killing him; he lost all joy of life. Now there was no possibility of ever being happy, and this God would come morning and evening and torture him. So one day he said ‘Okay, give me a beautiful golden palace.’ Immediately his hut became a\ngolden palace, and he saw that the whole town had golden palaces – bigger palaces, doubly bigger, all golden – only his was the poorest one.\nHe went to a lawyer – because where else can you go when such legal problems arise? The lawyer said ‘You don’t be worried’ – and of course God cannot win with a lawyer – the lawyer said ‘You ask “Now, make a big well in front of my house without a wall”.’ So a big well appeared before his palace and two wells appeared before everybody else’s. The lawyer said ‘Now ask “Make me one-eyed, let one eye disappear”.’ The man said ‘What are you saying?’ and the lawyer said ‘Just wait. Law is law.’ His one eye disappeared and both of his neighbours’ eyes disappeared. Now, the whole town blind... two wells in each palace garden... people started falling in wells, people started dying. And the man was utterly happy. He said ‘Now, my desires are fulfilled!’\nSo, I know, Sudha, you will be in difficulty: I declare you extraordinary, but everybody else, all your neighbours – even Pramod – is doubly extraordinary.\nAnd please, don’t go to a lawyer! The second question:\nQuestion 2\nCAN I KNOW A QUESTION THE ANSWER OF WHICH YOU DO NOT KNOW?\nIn fact, I don’t know the answer of any question. All that I go on doing is destroying the questioner, and the question. It is not answering. Just look at what happened to Sudha – destroyed, murdered! Is this an answer? I don’t know a single answer, but once you ask a question, you are in my hands. Then I push you this way and that, then I hit you this way and that. Ask the question, and you are trapped; first I try to destroy the question, and then the questioner.\nBut that is the whole function of a Master. The Master is not there to answer your stupid questions; he has to destroy your stupidity so that no questions arise again. So you cannot ask a question without being trapped in it.\nThe questioner is a new person it seems, his name is P. Jagannath Patro. He must be a new arrival – unacquainted with the way things are dealt with here.\nI am reminded of a story...\nMulla Nasruddin was made a Justice of the Peace, a J.P. The first day he was in the court a man came rushing in. And the man was only wearing one underwear – almost naked – and was shouting ‘I have been robbed! Catch the people who have cheated me and robbed me!’\nAnd Mulla Nasruddin asked ‘Where have you been robbed ? In this town ?’ He said ‘Yes, in this town, just on the outskirts. I was going to Mecca on a religious pilgrimage. My money has been taken away, my clothes have been taken away – my wife also! I have been utterly robbed. Save me, and you are the magistrate here so do something.’\nMulla said ‘No, this case does not come under my jurisdiction. It is not under my rule. You go to the neighbouring villages.’ He said ‘Why? I have been robbed here.’ And the Mulla said ‘No, because those people who have robbed you can’t belong to this town, they must belong to the neighbouring villages.’ The man said ‘How can you be so certain?’ He said ‘I am absolutely certain. Things are done totally here. If they were of this village, they would have taken your underwear too. We don’t do things so partially. You go to some other village; these people must belong to some other place, they can’t belong to my village, that much is certain. I know my people, they do things in a total way, in an absolute way. Your underwear is enough proof that you have not been robbed by my people.’\nWhen you ask a question, you are giving your head to me. That’s why a disciple asks a question: he is asking ‘Cut my head off’. The question is just an excuse, he is saying ‘Destroy this mind.’ I am not answering you because the answer is not going to help; it will make you more knowledgeable. I am not here to make you more knowledgeable. All the knowledge that you have has tO be taken away; you have to be robbed of it, and totally robbed of it – not even an underwear has to be left.\nIf I can destroy all that you have been carrying all along as knowledge, if I can help you to unlearn what you have learned, if I can uncondition you of all your conditionings, then knowing will arise in you. Knowing is your inner capacity, it is your intuition.\nThe question is arising in you because your knowing is obstructed, because your knowing ‘I’ is not functioning, hence the question; otherwise, you would solve it yourself, you would not go and ask anybody.\nAnd who can solve your question if you cannot solve it? And how can anybody else solve it? Your question implies your whole life in it; it is not just a question, it is only an indicator of a thousand and one things. When you ask a question, that question nobody else can ask, only you can ask it. That is specific, because to ask that question you had to live a certain kind of life, you had to be conditioned in a certain way, you had to pass through certain experiences. Nobody else has passed through those experiences except you. The question arises in you; it is the flowering of all the nonsense that has been taught to you, all the scriptures that have been fed into your bio-computer, all the books that you have read. The churches, the priests, the parents – all are implied in it.\nA question is not a simple thing, it is a very complex phenomenon. And I am not here to answer it. If I answer it, you will gather a little bit more knowledge, you will go home knowing a little bit more than when you had come. I will not have helped you, I will have burdened you more. Your knowledge is the rock that is hindering you from knowing Knowledge is the poison that doesn’t allow you to know. The knowledge has to be utterly destroyed so that you can be left alone and naked.\nOne can move towards God only when one is utterly naked. That nakedness is innocence, that nakedness is child-like, that nakedness is the purity of the heart, that nakedness IS the heart. Mind is full of knowledge, the heart is absolutely empty.\nThe work of a Master is to help you unburden. So I don’t answer your questions, I destroy them. And if the situation is right, I not only destroy the question, I destroy the questioner too. And if you are not, then you will know what is. When you are not, God is.\nYou ask me: CAN I KNOW A QUESTION THE ANSWER OF WHICH YOU DO NOT KNOW?\nNow, why have you asked this question? It must be coming out of a great ego, as if you are in an argument with me, as if you would like to defeat me. You would like to ask a question the answer of which I don’t know – why? So that you can have the feeling that you are the person who has such a question that not even an enlightened person can answer it?\nYou are not interested in solving the problems of your life, you are more interested in showing your knowledge. But you cannot defeat me because I don’t answer questions at all. If I were answering questions then there are thousands of questions which I could not answer. But I am not answering questions at all – that is not what is going on here. This is not a place of discussion, argument, this is a place of love. You are not here to debate with me. If you are here to debate with me, you are wasting your time. If you are here to be with me – not to debate, but to feel, but to be – if you are here to feel my presence, then only should you be here, otherwise not.\nIf I were only answering questions then you could ask thousands of questions. And they would not have to be very great; you could ask simple questions: Where is Timbuktu? and I might not be able to pinpoint exactly where it is; I have only heard the name. Timbuktu is a small place – sometimes I cannot even figure out where a certain country is. My geography is weak, my mathematics too; about history I am absolutely absurd – everything is topsyturvy. Then you could ask a thousand and one questions: When was Socrates married to Xanthippe? I would not be able to answer you. You can find millions of questions – that is not the problem at all – but that is not the purpose of your being here or my being here. It is not a kind of competition between the questioner and The answerer – we are not debating about anything – we are just here to be together, we are learning the ways of togetherness.\nYou are here to soak the energy that I am. You are here to drink the alcohol that I am. This is a place for drunkards.\nNow, sir, Jagannath Patro, you have come into wrong company. This is not the place for you unless you are ready to move in a totally different dimension – the dimension where the question is not answered but destroyed.\nWhen a mind comes to a state where no questions are left because all questions have been destroyed, when a mind is in a non-questioning state, that is the clarity, that is the transparency, that is where SATORI happens, that is where one comes in contact with existence.\nIt is not by becoming knowledgeable that you will know, it is by becoming innocent that you will know. The third question:\nQuestion 3\nWHY ARE METHODS NEEDED WHEN RELEASEMENT CAN HAPPEN INSTANTLY, HERENOW? I AM SO TIRED OF TRIPS. HOW MANY MORE MUST I TRY ONLY TO FIND? THEY DON’T WORK EITHER? I KNOW THE PROBLEM IS IN ME AND I KNOW THERE IS NO PROBLEM. SO NOW WHAT?\nCelebrate now. Sing, dance, love, be.\nYou say: WHY ARE METHODS NEEDED WHEN RELEASEMENT CAN HAPPEN INSTANTLY, HERENOW?\nBecause you cannot trust me, that’s why. You cannot trust me. I go on declaring that you are Buddhas, already enlightened, but you are sceptical about it. You can believe – that too very grudgingly – that a Gautam Buddha may have become enlightened, maybe, perhaps. A Jesus became enlightened, maybe. You can grudgingly concede that much, but to concede that you are enlightened is too much. You cannot give such a gift to yourself; you are so against yourself, you are so condemnatory towards yourself. You can immediately accept it if somebody says that you are a sinner. Just think of it; if somebody says you are a sinner, you are ready to bow down. Even if on the surface you deny it, deep down you know that he is right because from the very beginning you have been taught – you have been poisoned – that you are a sinner. The teaching has gone into your very blood and bones and marrow; it has become part of you that ‘you are a sinner’. All the religions of the world have been teaching this; for centuries, generations upon generations have been doing only one work: condemning man.\nYou are not even aware of the self-condemnation that you have for yourself, the hate that you have for yourself You don’t love yourself, how can you allow yourself to be a Buddha?\nReleasement can happen this moment, but you won’t allow it, hence methods are needed. If people can trust me, then there is no need for any method. The method is not going to help the releasement. Let me remind you, the method is only going to help you trust me. So I send you into therapy groups. Teertha and Divya and Siddha and Amitabh and Pradeepa – these people will work on you. They will help only one thing: they will help you to trust me.\nThe whole function of therapy groups here is totally different than it is in the West; it has a totally different meaning and significance. It is to create trust, it is to create a little love for yourself, it is to create acceptance. Then I send you into meditations; those meditations are cathartic.\nA cathartic meditation is just throwing all the repressed energy that is boiling in you, that won’t allow you to trust. Dynamic, Kundalini, and others will take away much energy that hinders; it will be released. Slowly slowly you will become capable of trusting. It is only because of lack of trust that methods have to be invented. If you trust already, then there is no need for any method.\nYou ask me: WHY ARE METHODS NEEDED WHEN RELEASEMENT CAN HAPPEN INSTANTLY HERENOW?\nReleasement will always happen instantly; whether it happens today or tomorrow it will always happen instantly, suddenly. It is a sudden experience, a lightning, and the whole past disappears; you are abruptly cut from the past, you become discontinuous with it. The old disappears and the new is born. And the new is not a modification of The old; it has no relationship with the old, it is simply unrelated with the old. The old has not caused it either, it is not an effect of the old, it is utterly unrelated with the old.\nKrishnamurti has been saying the same thing for at least fifty years, but nothing much has happened. He goes on saying that it is possible just now – be aware, be awake. And people go on listening, because the problem is they cannot trust Krishnamurti that this can be just now. Their minds are\nspinning and weaving inside ‘This is not possible – how can it be possible? What will happen to my past karmas? I have to undo them. And what about all the crimes and the sins I have committed? I have to be punished for them. And what about the Judgement Day? How can it happen right now?’ Deep inside these unconscious rumblings go on and on. And you go on listening...\nSeeing the failure of Krishnamurti, I have invented methods. I am saying essentially the same thing, because the message cannot be different. But I had to invent methods so that they can destroy your mistrust. Methods will help you to become unblocked; they will help you to become more flowing, they will help you to be less frozen – they will melt you, they will warm up the process of your being.\nReleasement is going to happen instantly, any moment it is going to happen. But if you are ready, it can happen this very moment – not even a single moment more do you have to wait.\nWHY ARE METHODS NEEDED WHEN RELEASEMENT CAN HAPPEN INSTANTLY, HERENOW?\nBecause of you, not because of me. From my side I am very much puzzled why it is not happening to you. It should happen, why is it not happening? Why do you go on listening without understanding it? Why do you listen only intellectually? Why can’t you listen from the heart, from your totality? It is a constant wonder to me – a miracle – that people can go on listening every day and can remain the same, hence the methods. The methods are not for the releasement, you are not going to become enlightened through any meditation, no; nobody has ever become enlightened through any meditation, but the meditations help. In a negative way they help; they remove the rocks and the stream starts flowing. They don’t create the stream, they can’t create it – how can rocks create the stream? They have nothing to do with the nature of the stream, but they can prevent it.\nBecause there are things which are preventing you from trusting the moment, trusting God, trusting life, trusting existence, you are shrunk in fear, in doubt. In doubt and fear you have armoured yourself just to be secure, safe; you have created a great armour around yourself. Your body is no more an opening to existence; it has become closed. Your windows, your doors, are all closed. The sun rises – yes, the sun rises in the evening – but it cannot penetrate in you. It goes on rising, it goes on knocking on your door, but the knock is subtle – so subtle, so silent, that you cannot hear it in your noisy mind, in that constant chatter that goes on inside you.\nThese methods are negative methods; they will not give you enlightenment, but they will remove the barriers. And once the barriers are removed, once all the barriers are removed, enlightenment happens. It is nothing that you have to achieve; when you are available... the release, the liberation.\nYou say: I AM SO TIRED OF TRIPS.\nReally? I don’t think so. If one is really tired, then one’s trips are finished. You are still hoping – maybe there is still some trip, some way of tripping so that you can attain. You are still hoping. You are looking out of the corner of the eye. ‘Maybe I have failed ninety-nine times; but who knows ? I may succeed the hundredth time. I have failed up to now, but who knows? I may be trying the wrong methods, and there may be some right method. I have failed because I may have been with wrong Masters, and there may be some right Master. I have failed because I have not put all of my energy into it; if I put all of my energy into it I may succeed. I have failed because the time was not ripe for it and now the time may be ripe.’ And a thousand and one excuses you can always find when you\nwant to go on a new trip. If you are really tired, then who is preventing you? Then forget all about trips, relax, celebrate, be.\nI AM SO TIRED OF TRIPS. HOW MANY MORE MUST I TRY ONLY TO FIND THEY DON’T WORK EITHER?\nNothing ever works, nothing has ever worked, because nothing is needed for it to work. Life is going perfectly well – there is no need to do anything whatsoever. But this vision comes slowly slowly, when you have failed again and again and again. It sinks in very slowly. Our minds are very stubborn, hard, rock-like; they are not soft soil – they don’t allow anything to sink in easily. Hence sometimes it takes lives for a person to realize that nothing ever works. And that is a great moment when one realizes that nothing ever works, nothing can work. ‘My whole effort to attain was absolutely wrong from the very beginning. It was wrong because what I am trying to achieve is already the case. It is wrong because I am searching and it is already there inside me.’\nAll efforts are meaningless. If a person is intelligent, he will understand it soon. If he is not intelligent, he will take a little longer; it depends on your intelligence. A very intelligent person, attentive, alert, aware, will see the point in a single moment; with a single blow his head will disappear. He will see the point and all is finished – all misery, all hell, all search.\nI AM SO TIRED OF TRIPS, you say. HOW MANY MORE MUST I TRY ONLY TO FIND THEY DON’T WORK EITHER?\nIt all depends on you. You can make a trip out of me\nNow, the question is from Hal Duggan, and he is taking sannyas on the twentieth. It depends on you; that too can become a trip. From my side it is not; it is the end of all trips. It is just a declaration that enough is enough. Sannyas is a declaration that ‘I am not going into any more trips’, that all methods have failed, and all paths have failed, that all paths lead astray, that ‘I am not going to be caught into any method, into any path, anymore.’ Sannyas is a renunciation of all methods, all paths, all trips – psychedelic or otherwise.\nBut you can also make sannyas a trip – it depends on you – and then you will miss again. Sannyas is not a trip. It is the realization that all trips are bound to fail. It is coming out of all trips, it is coming home. It is realizing the fact that you don’t waste your energy and time in searching for anything anymore, you don’t go on waiting for anything to happen in the future, because it is already happening – it has always been happening. Dance, sing, celebrate, be.\nGod is, he has not to be searched for. God already is, you are not to discover him. All you have to do is dance a mad dance, you have to dance in such a mad way that all the doors are thrown open. You have to sing with such totality that the ego dissolves into that totality. You have to be in prayer, in gratitude, with such passion and intensity that the whole starts flowing towards you; your waiting becomes a magnetic field.\nSannyas is not a trip. So, Hal Duggan, remember it, it is not a trip. Don’t reduce sannyas to a trip.\nI am not a trip. I am not here to create new bondages for you, I am here to make you free, totally free. That’s why I don’t give you any discipline, I give you only awareness. That’s why I don’t give you\nany character, I give you only alertness. And out of alertness if a character arises, good. And out of awareness a character certainly arises, but a very fluid and flowing character. It is not a fixed mode of life, because all modes are dead, stagnant. A character arises out of consciousness, but the consciousness goes on changing, so the character goes on changing; the consciousness goes on reflecting each moment the new reality that is happening, and the character goes on corresponding to the new reality that is happening. There is continuous adjustment, spontaneous adjustment, between you and the whole.\nThe people who have fixed characters are always maladjusted, because they have a fixed character and life has no fixed character. God is characterless, and if you have a character you will never meet God, because your character will confine you into a certain strait jacket; you will become a stereotype, you will not be a living being anymore; you will be a noun not a verb.\nGod is a verb not a noun. God is a process, a dynamism; and a man of character, the so-called man of character, is dull, dead. He has to be dull and dead, because if he were aware he would have to see the changes that are happening around him and he would have to change accordingly. He has to remain drugged in his unconsciousness, he has to remain fixed with his character because he is always afraid that something may happen and he may have to change his character. He does not want to change his character so he goes on remaining unaware of all that is changing. He also creates a society which is unchanging. That’s why in the East the society has remained unchanging, it is because of the so-called ‘character’-obsession. If a man has to have a fixed character, then the society has also to be a fixed pattern; only then will he be adjusted, otherwise there will be difficulty.\nIn the East thousands of years have passed and things have remained almost the same; they have not changed – they have not been allowed to change because then there is fear. And that’s what is happening in the West now: because things are changing, people are losing character, and the Western religious leaders are very much worried. Life is changing fast; science has released so many energies that life goes on changing. And one has to change with it, one has to keep pace with life. And if one has to keep pace with life, one cannot stay in a fixed mode. It is very easy to live in an Indian village and remain in a fixed mode; it is very difficult to live in New York with a fixed mode of life – you have to be more fluid.\nSo the Eastern people think that Western people don’t have any character. What the reality is in fact is that the West has become more alive, more changing, and the East is still dull and dead, fixated, obsessed and afraid. ‘If anything changes on the outside then I will have to change inside too, because my inside has to correspond with the outside.’\nSmall changes bring difficulties. For example, since electricity came to India, many Jainas have started eating in the night. Now, for centuries they have not eaten in the night – they had a fixed mode – but when electricity came, suspicions arose, doubts arose. Now, what is the problem? Electricity is there, light is there – there is no fear of any insect or any ant entering into your food – you will not be killing anything. Now in the night you can have more light than you have in the day, so many Jainas started eating in the night. Now, what is the problem? And when one thing falls, then other things start falling, because everything is connected; all things are connected with each other. If you can eat in the night and Mahavir is wrong about it, maybe he is wrong about other things too.\nThat’s why the church has been fighting against science, because it creates suspicion. The church has believed that the earth is flat, and then science started saying it is not flat, it is a globe. Now,\nif Jesus is wrong about one thing, why can’t he be wrong about other things ? Then he is no more infallible; suspicion will arise. He may be wrong about God too, he may be wrong about the Judgement Day, he may be absolutely wrong, who knows? because he is fallible.\nReligions have always insisted that nothing should change; these religions are all in the service of death. I am giving you a totally new vision: a religion of life not of death, a religion of intelligence not of stupidity, a religion of dynamism not of stagnancy, a religion which will keep you flowing with the flow of the total and will not in any way hold you back from the movement of the total. It will keep you in tune with the whole. I don’t give a character to you, I only give consciousness. My whole emphasis is on consciousness.\nSitting is Zen, walking is Zen, talking is Zen, being silent is Zen. All should be only awareness. Awareness should be your God. Let awareness be the only fundamental law, and then you will be out of all trips; otherwise, it is difficult. You can go on changing from one trip to another. A Christian can become a Hindu; this is just changing the train – the trip remains. A Hindu can become a Christian, and nothing changes, only words; he will not go to the temple, he will go to the church.\nAnd the same can be done with me too, but remember that will be your responsibility. I can also become a trip to you. I don’t want to become a trip to you, I want to become a liberation to you. From my side I want you to be liberated, but still, your cooperation will be needed. The very idea of liberation, and you can catch hold of it and make a trip out of it. And your mind is very very efficient in making trips out of everything. Beware.\nHal Duggan, on the twentieth you are going to become a sannyasin. Remember, this is not a trip, this is the end of all trips. Let it be the end of all trips. How long are you going to journey and journey and journey? Now, come home. Now, come to rest. Enough of the trips. Learn from me how to rest, how to relax, how to be.\nThe fourth question:\nQuestion 4\nLAST NIGHT I HAD THIS DREAM: IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, THE SUN APPEARED, COMPLETELY OUT OF ITS PLACE. THIS FILLED ME WITH A SACRED TERROR WHICH WAS OUTSIDE OF ANY DREAM. BUT AT THE CENTRE OF THE TERROR CAME THE REMEMBRANCE OF YOU AND THE STATE YOU REPRESENT, WHICH IS BEYOND ALL FEAR, AND IT VANISHED, LEAVING ME IN AN EMPTINESS FOR SOME MOMENT. I FELT I UNDERSTOOD A LITTLE OF HOW LOVING YOU MADLY CAN ENABLE ME TO GO ANYWHERE!\nAnadideva, this is a beautiful experience.\nModern researchers, particularly dream researchers, have stumbled upon a new kind of dream just recently; they call it the breakthrough dream. This is a breakthrough dream. The normal dream, the ordinary dream, and the breakthrough dream are totally different dreams. This is the difference, this is of great importance to you, to you all. If you can bring this quality to the dream, you will be able to go beyond dreaming.\nA breakthrough dream is a dream in which some kind of awareness arises in you. The ordinary dream is unconscious, passive; you simply go on watching – no awareness arises in you – you are simply identified With the dream. You don’t remember a thing, you don’t remember yourself; you are not aware at all, you are lost in the dream. The ordinary dream possesses you. The breakthrough dream is different: it is not passive, it is active; it is not just possessing you, you remain in some way alert in it.\nGurdjieff used to teach his disciples about such dreaming. This is a key to work deeper into your consciousness. He used to say to his disciples ‘Try to remember yourself in the dream, and the only way to do it is if you remember the whole day, only then you can remember.’ So the method was that the person who was given this work had to remember continuously the whole day. Walking on the street he remembers ‘This is a dream. All these shops, these people, this man passing by, this noise – all this is a dream. This woman who looks so beautiful is a dream. This tree is a dream.’ The whole day the man continues thinking ‘This is dream, this is dream’; he repeats it millions of times – ‘This is dream’. Naturally, the idea that this is dream penetrates more and more into his unconscious, and soon it is transferred to the conscious. Then, one day, suddenly – it takes three to six months of constant repeating ‘This is dream, this is dream, this is dream’ – one day, suddenly, in dream, he remembers this is dream, and that very moment, a new energy has entered into dreaming, he is alert, aware.\nAnd this is not a new method. In the East, we have used it for centuries. In fact, The whole idea that the world is maya is nothing but a philosophic statement of this technique. ‘The world is maya’ means the world is dream. You have to remember it: ‘This is a dream, this is a dream, this is a dream’; and, then, one day, in a dream, you remember this is a dream. And then, suddenly, there is a gap between you and the dream. The dream is there, you are here, and there is a gap – you have awakened in the dream. And the moment you awaken in the dream, the dream loses all vitality, it disappears; it starts disappearing, and great emptiness arises.\nThis is what has happened to you, Anadideva: you have stumbled upon a breakthrough dream.\nJust the other day I was talking about four stages of consciousness: waking, dreaming, deep sleep, and TURIYA, the fourth. Ordinarily you remain in the waking, because you can’t even remember in waking; your waking is almost asleep. You are only awake for the name’s sake. Very rarely are you awake even when you are in a wakeful state – very rarely. If somebody comes up suddenly with a revolver in his hand and puts the revolver on your chest, maybe for a moment you will become alert. Those moments in your whole life can be counted on fingers.\nOnce I was travelling with a friend and the car fell into a river. The friend was driving. When the car fell, just for a few seconds everybody in the car became alert that it was going to fall, because somehow the brake was not working, and the speed was such that on a certain turn it became absolutely clear that now... Everybody in the car became alert that it was finished. And the next moment we were all in the dry bed – it was summer time – and the car was upside down. The moment we came out... nobody was hurt, but everybody was transformed. The man who was driving told me ‘You have been talking about awareness, awareness, awareness, and I have been listening to you for years. Now, for the first time, I felt what you mean by awareness. For a moment, just on the verge of falling, I became aware; now I know what it is. All became silent. Although death was so close all was utter bliss.’\nVery rarely do you become aware. But if you start trying to become aware – that is what VIPASSANA is: an effort to be aware, watching, watching each act that you are doing – slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, very slowly, you start feeling a new kind of awareness, a new kind of presence. That presence makes you a different kind of individual – more integrated, more centred.\nJust the other day I told you the story of the Buddhist monk who was invited by the prostitute to live with her for four months in the rainy season. Now, Prabuddha has asked a question, and he says the story was ugly. ‘Why could the Buddhist monk not move in love-making with the prostitute? Why was he afraid?’\nHe was not afraid. And the story is not ugly. Maybe Prabuddha became too interested in Amrapalli and her beauty. Prabuddha must have started thinking ‘If I had been there... I would not have missed! And this foolish monk... and what was wrong in it?’ It is not a question of wrong or right. But the monk was so centred, the monk was so present in himself, that all that the prostitute was doing to attract him must have looked to him very juvenile, foolish, silly. What the prostitute was doing to enchant him was great from the side of the prostitute. She was an artist in that art of alluring people, of hypnotizing people. And she was a beautiful woman. It is said that she was the next most famous person in Buddha’s time – the first was Buddha and Amrapalli was the second.\nBut if the monk is centred and has no feeling arising in him to go into love-making, why should he go? If he has transcended, why should he go? It is not that he was resisting; if he were resisting or repressing then it would be ugly. But why should he indulge if there is no desire in him? Just because of the prostitute? Why docs the story look ugly to Prabuddha? No, he was very kind to the woman, infinitely kind, infinitely loving. But, of course, the love of a centred man is totally different from the love of an uncentred man. He was a Buddha, that’s why Buddha had allowed him to go. He had arrived; all desiring had disappeared from him. Now it was just a toy.\nAnd the story is immensely beautiful, because remaining centred, he helped the woman. He really must have loved the woman, because that is the greatest gift he could have given to her. If he had become involved, the woman would have thrown him out sooner or later. If he had become involved, the woman would have never gone to Buddha to become a disciple. This was the greatest gift that the monk could have given to the woman – the gift of Buddha, the gift of disciplehood. He made himself absolutely available for the woman to watch, to see, in every possible way. He made his presence felt, and the woman came to know that this was something to be achieved, this was something worthwhile. All that she had been doing up to now was worthless, insignificant, non- essential. This man had essential richness – the richness of the essence. She fell in love with the monk on a higher plane; she fell in love not only with the monk but she fell in love with SAMADHI, with enlightenment.\nIn fact, that was the reason for the beauty of the monk. She had not gone into love because of the monk, the monk was a vehicle, the energy was that of enlightenment, he was luminous. She had fallen in love with that luminousness. The body of the monk was just like a lamp and the luminousness inside was the flame. You don’t fall in love with the lamp, you fall in love with the flame. If the monk had moved, the flame would have disappeared and the woman would have found an ordinary man – very ordinary, nothing special about him, nothing valuable about him.\nThe more the monk remained centred... And when I say remained centred I am not saying he was making any effort to remain centred. He was centred; it was effortless, it was spontaneous, it was\nnatural. If there were any effort involved, the monk himself would have been afraid to go. He was not afraid; he slept in the same room with the woman. And the woman danced naked around him, and he sat in silence and meditated there. He remained alone. The woman must have tried in every possible way – it was a challenge, it was a great challenge to her beauty. It was humiliating in a way, insulting in a way; she must have felt hurt, her ego must have felt hurt. She tried in every way to seduce the monk but failed again and again and again. Then she must have realized that he had some other kind of beauty, he had some other kind of presence. And she became enchanted with that space; she followed him, and became a disciple of Buddha. She became enlightened soon. Amrapalli was one of the enlightened disciples of Buddha.\nThe monk loved the woman, that’s why with great kindness and compassion he made his presence available. There is nothing ugly in it; it is absolutely beautiful. The monk was a benediction, a blessing.\nBut you go on moving in life, attracted by this thing and that; you are unaware. If you become aware, your attractions will start dropping, disappearing. And when you become aware in the dream, the dream disappears immediately, and there arises great silence. That silence is the third state, SUSHUPTI, deep sleep.\nA breakthrough dream means that you have moved into the third – and with a little bit of consciousness. That is a great experience, that is the first approach into the deepest layer of your being. Beyond that there is only one state more, TURIYA.\nPatanjali has said that deep sleep is closest to SAMADHI; it is. If you take one step more, you are a Buddha. SAMADHI IS the centre, turiya is the centre; around that centre the first layer is of sleep, the second layer is of dreaming, the third layer is of your so-called waking. You have to go deeper and deeper. Waking is the farthest from TURIYA, dreaming is a little closer. That’s why psychoanalysis goes into your dreaming. Rather than thinking about your waking experiences, psychoanalysis goes into your dreaming, because there you are more true, more honest, more simple, more natural. Yoga goes a little deeper, it goes into SUSHUPTI, deep sleep.\nA breakthrough dream is a dream which takes you to SUSHUPTI. And after SUSHUPTI there is only a single step more; Zen and Tantra take you into that single step.\nIt was a beautiful dream, Anadideva. I will read it again.\nLAST NIGHT I HAD THIS DREAM: IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, THE SUN APPEARED, COMPLETELY OUT OF ITS PLACE. THIS FILLED ME WITH A SACRED TERROR WHICH WAS OUTSIDE OF ANY DREAM. BUT AT THE CENTRE OF THIS TERROR CAME THE REMEMBRANCE OF YOU AND THE STATE YOU REPRESENT, WHICH IS BEYOND ALL FEAR...\nThis is beautiful that you could remember me in your dream. Every disciple has to learn that. I have to be with you not only in your waking but in your dreaming too. And if I am there, dreaming will disappear. The very remembrance will disconnect you with the dreaming layer.\nBUT AT THE CENTRE OF THIS TERROR CAME THE REMEMBRANCE OF YOU AND THE STATE YOU REPRESENT, WHICH IS BEYOND ALL FEAR, AND IT VANISHED, LEAVING ME IN AN EMPTINESS FOR SOME MOMENTS.\nThose moments of emptiness are of the third state, SHUSHUPTI, deep sleep. Now, try to do it again and again. Every night when you go to sleep, go with this thought vibrating in you, pulsating in you: ‘If there is a dream, I will remember.’ Remember me. While you are falling asleep, go on remembering so that it soaks into your sleep. While you are changing from waking to dreaming, let it be there – a subtle presence – and then slowly slowly you can transform all your normal dreams into breakthrough dreams, and each dream will lead you into the third state, deep sleep. And when you can be aware in deep sleep – even for a few moments – you are coming closer home. Then, one day, you will be able to remember me even in that emptiness, and that very day the sky opens up, that very moment the sun really rises in the evening.\nIt is very symbolic that you saw the sun rising in the middle of the night; it was in the dream state. Soon it will happen if you can remember me in the deep sleep beyond which nothing can be said, but beyond which all is, God is.\nThe last question:\nQuestion 5 OOOH OSHO!\nTHE WHOLE LIFE WATERFALLING ON ME!\nHEAVEN AND EARTH, WORK AND PLAY, EVERYTHING I HAVE EVER BEEN AND DONE, ALL THINGS I\nHAVE EVER WANTED TO WILL BE,\nPAST AND FUTURE SWELLING SWELLING IN BALLOON DANCING NOW!\nTHIS ENLIGHTENMENT IS SOME CRAZY BUSINESS!\nCrazy baby, crazy... absolutely crazy! But don’t be afraid. Go into it, and soon you will see the sanity of insanity, soon you will see that it is not crazy. You have been crazy all along before it. It looks crazy compared to your life that has happened up to now. People are living in madness, so when they come closer and closer to some inner light, compared to their life it looks crazy. Once it settles, the whole of life looks crazy, and only this light, this awareness, looks sane.\nBuddha was sane, although he himself was worried many times that he had gone crazy. Others were also saying that he had gone crazy. Naturally, when all are competing in the world, and everybody is rushing towards money, power, and prestige, and you start moving away from all this nonsense; when everybody is going extrovert, and you start moving inwards; when everybody is going in one direction and you start moving in the polar opposite direction, diametrically opposite direction, it looks crazy.\nOnce it happened...\nA drunkard was driving on a one-way street and was going in the wrong direction. He was puzzled, because everybody was going the other way. The policeman stopped him and asked him ‘Where are you going?’\nHe said ‘That I don’t know. One thing is certain, that wherever I am going I am late because everybody is coming back!’\nWhen you start moving towards meditation, suddenly the whole world, everybody, is going one way and you are going in the opposite direction. And everybody looks at you with suspicion ‘Where are you going?’ You will also look with suspicion at yourself, and the idea will arise again and again ‘Have I gone crazy?’\nBut one has to learn one thing: if you are feeling happy, don’t be worried, because craziness cannot give you happiness. If you are feeling less tense, don’t be worried, because craziness will give you more tension, more anxiety. If you are feeling more together, don’t be worried, then you are on the right track – you are moving towards well-being, you are moving towards wholeness.\nAnd that is what is happening, Punita.\nYou say: THE WHOLE LIFE WATERFALLING ON ME! HEAVEN AND EARTH, WORK AND PLAY, EVERYTHING I HAVE EVER BEEN AND DONE, ALL THINGS I\nHAVE EVER WANTED TO WILL BE,\nPAST AND FUTURE SWELLING SWELLING IN BALLOON DANCING NOW!\nLook at the beauty of the dance. Look at the benediction of nature falling like a waterfall on you. Look at the expanding consciousness swelling, swelling; it will fill the who!e sky soon – even the sky is not the limit.\nTHIS ENLIGHTENMENT IS SOME CRAZY BUSINESS!\nIt is, but the people who become involved in this crazy business are the only sane people, because theirs is the kingdom of God. Blessed are the mad, for theirs is the kingdom of God.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"9888","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_sun_rises_in_the_evening/part8/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_sun_rises_in_the_evening/>The Sun Rises in the Evening</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">8 Enough of the Trips</h1><div class=post-meta>47 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;9888 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Sun_Rises_in_the_Evening/part8.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part7>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

will create misery for yourself. Even I cannot help, even I cannot go
against the Tao, against the fundamental law of life. God only creates
the extraordinary; this whole existence is special. These raindrops,
this morning, the people around you this moment is extraordinary; it
can’t be repeated again, no, never – not even in the whole of</p><p>eternity can it be repeated again. You will never find these
raindrops falling again, this sound, this morning, these people. This
whole situation is extraordinary; it only happens once.</p><p><br></p><p>You will not find another Sudha all around the world. You can go on
searching, and not only in the present time, but even in the past or in
the future, and no Sudha will ever be repeated. This is how we are. Once
you start trying to be extraordinary you will get into difficulty.</p><p><br></p><p>To accept yourself as you are, and to accept the whole as it is – if
you can understand the extraordinariness of everything that is – you
have become ordinary.</p><p><br></p><p>Sudha, it is not that you want to be extraordinary, you want to be
special COMPARED WITH other people. That too is absurdity – no
comparison is possible. How can you be compared with anybody? – nobody
is like you. You don’t compare a dog with a parrot, or do you? There is
no similarity, there is no likeness, how can you compare a dog with a
parrot? or a tree with a man? or a rock with a river? In fact, no two
individuals are alike, hence they are incomparable. You are you, and the
other is other.</p><p><br></p><p>To understand this is to be both extraordinary and ordinary.
Extraordinary in the sense that existence only creates unique people,
and ordinary in the sense that everybody is extraordinary. There is
nothing extraordinary in being extraordinary; everybody is so. The
comparison disappears; and when there is no comparison, there is no
possibility of the ego.</p><p><br></p><p>You ask me: PLEASE HELP ME TO BE HAPPY...</p><p><br></p><p>I can only help you to be not miserable, I cannot help you to be
happy. But if you are not miserable, you will be happy. But no direct
way is possible to make you happy. If it were possible, I would have
made you happy long before now. I am not a miser, I would have given it
to you if it were possible to give at all – but there is no
possibility.</p><p><br></p><p>Happiness is not something that is going to happen to you from the
outside. Once you stop being miserable, happiness is, happiness wells up
within your being. It simply arises out of you; you start blooming – the
hindrances have been removed.</p><p><br></p><p>And this seems to be your greatest obstacle: you want to be
extraordinary. I declare it, Sudha, you are. But remember, everybody
else is too. So now there is no need to be worried, I certify you; you
need not prove it. Let this obstacle disappear. Accept your
extraordinariness, rejoice in it, celebrate it. Walt Whitman says ‘I
celebrate myself, I sing myself...’ Celebrate and sing. You are
extraordinary, God has not made another person like you, will never make
another person like you. It is only once that God exists as you, in you,
in this form. This form is unrepeatable.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, what is lacking? All your misery is arising because you are
trying to become it. It is your being; becoming is irrelevant. And then
suddenly you will see... If you can see the point... Don’t think about
it, Sudha, just see the point – it is so crystal clear – and a great
burden from your chest will disappear. So you are extraordinary! You
will take a deep breath, you will relax, and suddenly there is
happiness.</p><p><br></p><p>Happiness is not something that we have to produce or do anything
for; it is natural, it is spontaneous. I can help you not to be in
misery. Misery is your creation, happiness is God’s</p><p>creation. Misery is the gift that you have given to yourself,
happiness is the gift that God has given to you. But you cling to
misery, and when you cling, you feed it by your clinging. Drop it. Start
dancing and singing and celebrating. End it right now. And don’t say
‘Tomorrow’, because tomorrow never comes. And don’t say ‘I will think it
over’; either you have understood or you have missed. Thinking is not
going to help. It is a simple fact.</p><p><br></p><p>Let me repeat it again: everybody is extraordinary, so nobody needs
to try. Don’t suffer with this unnecessary inferiority. And if you
suffer from it, you can go on suffering for ages; you can go on
creating, and you can go on finding new ways and means. Somebody has a
longer nose than you – you are inferior. Somebody has blond hair – you
are inferior. Somebody has those beautiful eyes – and you are inferior.
Somebody is more intelligent – and you are inferior. Somebody is a
little taller – and you are inferior. If you go on looking and searching
for misery, it is available; you can find it in every person that passes
by, you will find something or other is missing in you. But this is your
way of looking at things that creates misery.</p><p><br></p><p>Forget everybody, just look into the gifts that God has given to you,
and gratitude arises. In fact, there is no reason, no RAISON D’ETRE for
this existence to be, no reason for this rain this morning, for this
melody, this beautiful song, that the clouds are singing around you. If
it were not there we could not have complained. If it were not there, we
could not have asked that it should be. It is simply there without our
asking. It is there. We have not even knocked at the door, and the door
is open. And millions of gifts are showering on you; just look at those
gifts, and you will be surprised. You will be surprised at how you have
been missing them. Just the joy of breathing is enough tO be grateful
for, just the joy of meeting a friend is enough to be grateful for, just
the joy of sitting silently doing nothing... The joy of a morning or an
evening, the joy of night... Just go on looking for the joyous, and you
will find it.</p><p><br></p><p>You only find that which you look for.</p><p><br></p><p>You have been looking for misery; now, you can create misery. Today
it is raining and tomorrow it will not be raining, then tomorrow you can
be miserable – ‘Why is it not raining today ?’ And when it is raining
you are not grateful.</p><p><br></p><p>Start feeling grateful. Happiness comes closer and closer the more
and more you become grateful. Gratitude functions like a magnetism; the
complaining mind repels happiness – it closes doors. It all depends on
you. I can show you the way, but you will have to walk on it. Buddha has
said ‘Buddhas can only point the way; they cannot walk for you.’ You
will have to walk. I am showing you the way, but you have become very
clever, efficient, in creating misery for yourself. Change the direction
of your energies; channelize them toward the joy, the beauty... this
cuckoo calling from far away. And, slowly slowly, you will see that so
many things were there but you were not seeing them. Your eyes were full
of misery hence you were missing them. Your eyes were clouded, they were
hazy, foggy, that’s why you were missing.</p><p><br></p><p>And one can miss by a small margin; one can miss by only a small
thought. A small thought can become a barrier and you can miss the whole
beauty of the vast Himalayas. You can be there, watching the beautiful
peaks of the Himalayas, and the sun falling on the Himalayan snow,
showering gold all around, and a thought comes into your mind, and the
Himalayas have disappeared, the thought clouds you. You remember
something: the other day somebody had insulted you, and that’s</p><p>enough. Or you start planning for the future, ‘Tomorrow I have to
leave’, and the Himalayas have disappeared. And the thought is so small,
and the Himalayas are so big... But even a small thought can hinder. The
thought is so close to you, and it can stand in between. Just a small
particle of dust can fall in your eye, and just a small particle –
almost invisible – can make you blind, and you cannot open your eyes,
and you cannot see the sun shining.</p><p><br></p><p>Sudha, do only one thing: start dropping the very concept of
inferiority, the very concept that you have to be extraordinary. Now,
even this question contains it; she has signed the question... your
ORDINARY BUDDHA, SUDHA. Even in that, the ego is claiming that ‘I am no
ordinary BUDDHA. I am an ORDINARY Buddha.’ You follow me? ‘Buddhas are
extraordinary people; I am not like them – I am an ordinary Buddha.’
This is claiming extraordinariness.</p><p><br></p><p>HELP ME FO BE ORDINARY.</p><p><br></p><p>You want to be extraordinarily ordinary? The ego can go on playing
games, subtle games. You will have to look through and through. Just
remember two things. One, you are already that which you want to be,
hence there is no need to do anything for it. You can call it
ordinariness, you can call it extraordinariness – it makes no difference
– you are already that, you can never be anything other than that. What
you call it does not matter. If you are in love with the word ‘ordinary’
then everybody is ordinary. If you love the word ‘extraordinary’ then
everybody is extraordinary. Remember only one thing, that whatsoever you
claim for yourself, you have claimed for the whole. And that is the
trouble, you would like to be special, not like everybody else.</p><p><br></p><p>It happened...</p><p><br></p><p>There is a beautiful parable...</p><p><br></p><p>A man worshipped God for many years and was always asking ‘Fulfil
only one of my desires.’ God must have got tired, bored. One day he
appeared and he said ‘Okay, you won’t leave me alone. Morning, evening,
you continuously go on harping on the same note “Fulfil one of my
desires.” Okay, I am here, what is your desire?’</p><p><br></p><p>And the man said ‘Whatsoever I ask should be immediately given to me,
that is my desire.’ Very cunning man! God must have thought – out of his
innocence – that he would ask for one thing; he asked for it all! He
said that he had only one desire that ‘Whatsoever I ask should be given
immediately to me.’ But you cannot defeat God, because cunningness never
defeats innocence. God said ‘Perfectly okay, this will be so, but
remember one thing: whatsoever you ask, your neighbours will get
double.’</p><p><br></p><p>Now, the man was finished. Months passed, and God would come again
and again. ‘You have not asked anything...?’ He stopped praying, and God
would come again and again, morning, evening, and he would say ‘What!
You have not asked yet?’ And the man became very bored with God. He
thought and thought, but whatsoever he will get, neighbours will get
double. ‘It is pointless!’ He always wanted to have a beautiful palace,
‘But what is the point now? The neighbours will have doubly big
palaces.’ The very idea was crushing him. killing him; he lost all joy
of life. Now there was no possibility of ever being happy, and this God
would come morning and evening and torture him. So one day he said
‘Okay, give me a beautiful golden palace.’ Immediately his hut became
a</p><p>golden palace, and he saw that the whole town had golden palaces –
bigger palaces, doubly bigger, all golden – only his was the poorest
one.</p><p><br></p><p>He went to a lawyer – because where else can you go when such legal
problems arise? The lawyer said ‘You don’t be worried’ – and of course
God cannot win with a lawyer – the lawyer said ‘You ask “Now, make a big
well in front of my house without a wall”.’ So a big well appeared
before his palace and two wells appeared before everybody else’s. The
lawyer said ‘Now ask “Make me one-eyed, let one eye disappear”.’ The man
said ‘What are you saying?’ and the lawyer said ‘Just wait. Law is law.’
His one eye disappeared and both of his neighbours’ eyes disappeared.
Now, the whole town blind... two wells in each palace garden... people
started falling in wells, people started dying. And the man was utterly
happy. He said ‘Now, my desires are fulfilled!’</p><p><br></p><p>So, I know, Sudha, you will be in difficulty: I declare you
extraordinary, but everybody else, all your neighbours – even Pramod –
is doubly extraordinary.</p><p><br></p><p>And please, don’t go to a lawyer! The second question:</p><p>Question 2</p><p><br></p><p>CAN I KNOW A QUESTION THE ANSWER OF WHICH YOU DO NOT KNOW?</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, I don’t know the answer of any question. All that I go on
doing is destroying the questioner, and the question. It is not
answering. Just look at what happened to Sudha – destroyed, murdered! Is
this an answer? I don’t know a single answer, but once you ask a
question, you are in my hands. Then I push you this way and that, then I
hit you this way and that. Ask the question, and you are trapped; first
I try to destroy the question, and then the questioner.</p><p><br></p><p>But that is the whole function of a Master. The Master is not there
to answer your stupid questions; he has to destroy your stupidity so
that no questions arise again. So you cannot ask a question without
being trapped in it.</p><p><br></p><p>The questioner is a new person it seems, his name is P. Jagannath
Patro. He must be a new arrival – unacquainted with the way things are
dealt with here.</p><p><br></p><p>I am reminded of a story...</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla Nasruddin was made a Justice of the Peace, a J.P. The first day
he was in the court a man came rushing in. And the man was only wearing
one underwear – almost naked – and was shouting ‘I have been robbed!
Catch the people who have cheated me and robbed me!’</p><p><br></p><p>And Mulla Nasruddin asked ‘Where have you been robbed ? In this town
?’ He said ‘Yes, in this town, just on the outskirts. I was going to
Mecca on a religious pilgrimage. My money has been taken away, my
clothes have been taken away – my wife also! I have been utterly robbed.
Save me, and you are the magistrate here so do something.’</p><p>Mulla said ‘No, this case does not come under my jurisdiction. It is
not under my rule. You go to the neighbouring villages.’ He said ‘Why? I
have been robbed here.’ And the Mulla said ‘No, because those people who
have robbed you can’t belong to this town, they must belong to the
neighbouring villages.’ The man said ‘How can you be so certain?’ He
said ‘I am absolutely certain. Things are done totally here. If they
were of this village, they would have taken your underwear too. We don’t
do things so partially. You go to some other village; these people must
belong to some other place, they can’t belong to my village, that much
is certain. I know my people, they do things in a total way, in an
absolute way. Your underwear is enough proof that you have not been
robbed by my people.’</p><p><br></p><p>When you ask a question, you are giving your head to me. That’s why a
disciple asks a question: he is asking ‘Cut my head off’. The question
is just an excuse, he is saying ‘Destroy this mind.’ I am not answering
you because the answer is not going to help; it will make you more
knowledgeable. I am not here to make you more knowledgeable. All the
knowledge that you have has tO be taken away; you have to be robbed of
it, and totally robbed of it – not even an underwear has to be left.</p><p><br></p><p>If I can destroy all that you have been carrying all along as
knowledge, if I can help you to unlearn what you have learned, if I can
uncondition you of all your conditionings, then knowing will arise in
you. Knowing is your inner capacity, it is your intuition.</p><p><br></p><p>The question is arising in you because your knowing is obstructed,
because your knowing ‘I’ is not functioning, hence the question;
otherwise, you would solve it yourself, you would not go and ask
anybody.</p><p><br></p><p>And who can solve your question if you cannot solve it? And how can
anybody else solve it? Your question implies your whole life in it; it
is not just a question, it is only an indicator of a thousand and one
things. When you ask a question, that question nobody else can ask, only
you can ask it. That is specific, because to ask that question you had
to live a certain kind of life, you had to be conditioned in a certain
way, you had to pass through certain experiences. Nobody else has passed
through those experiences except you. The question arises in you; it is
the flowering of all the nonsense that has been taught to you, all the
scriptures that have been fed into your bio-computer, all the books that
you have read. The churches, the priests, the parents – all are implied
in it.</p><p><br></p><p>A question is not a simple thing, it is a very complex phenomenon.
And I am not here to answer it. If I answer it, you will gather a little
bit more knowledge, you will go home knowing a little bit more than when
you had come. I will not have helped you, I will have burdened you more.
Your knowledge is the rock that is hindering you from knowing Knowledge
is the poison that doesn’t allow you to know. The knowledge has to be
utterly destroyed so that you can be left alone and naked.</p><p><br></p><p>One can move towards God only when one is utterly naked. That
nakedness is innocence, that nakedness is child-like, that nakedness is
the purity of the heart, that nakedness IS the heart. Mind is full of
knowledge, the heart is absolutely empty.</p><p><br></p><p>The work of a Master is to help you unburden. So I don’t answer your
questions, I destroy them. And if the situation is right, I not only
destroy the question, I destroy the questioner too. And if you are not,
then you will know what is. When you are not, God is.</p><p><br></p><p>You ask me: CAN I KNOW A QUESTION THE ANSWER OF WHICH YOU DO NOT
KNOW?</p><p>Now, why have you asked this question? It must be coming out of a
great ego, as if you are in an argument with me, as if you would like to
defeat me. You would like to ask a question the answer of which I don’t
know – why? So that you can have the feeling that you are the person who
has such a question that not even an enlightened person can answer
it?</p><p><br></p><p>You are not interested in solving the problems of your life, you are
more interested in showing your knowledge. But you cannot defeat me
because I don’t answer questions at all. If I were answering questions
then there are thousands of questions which I could not answer. But I am
not answering questions at all – that is not what is going on here. This
is not a place of discussion, argument, this is a place of love. You are
not here to debate with me. If you are here to debate with me, you are
wasting your time. If you are here to be with me – not to debate, but to
feel, but to be – if you are here to feel my presence, then only should
you be here, otherwise not.</p><p><br></p><p>If I were only answering questions then you could ask thousands of
questions. And they would not have to be very great; you could ask
simple questions: Where is Timbuktu? and I might not be able to pinpoint
exactly where it is; I have only heard the name. Timbuktu is a small
place – sometimes I cannot even figure out where a certain country is.
My geography is weak, my mathematics too; about history I am absolutely
absurd – everything is topsyturvy. Then you could ask a thousand and one
questions: When was Socrates married to Xanthippe? I would not be able
to answer you. You can find millions of questions – that is not the
problem at all – but that is not the purpose of your being here or my
being here. It is not a kind of competition between the questioner and
The answerer – we are not debating about anything – we are just here to
be together, we are learning the ways of togetherness.</p><p><br></p><p>You are here to soak the energy that I am. You are here to drink the
alcohol that I am. This is a place for drunkards.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, sir, Jagannath Patro, you have come into wrong company. This is
not the place for you unless you are ready to move in a totally
different dimension – the dimension where the question is not answered
but destroyed.</p><p><br></p><p>When a mind comes to a state where no questions are left because all
questions have been destroyed, when a mind is in a non-questioning
state, that is the clarity, that is the transparency, that is where
SATORI happens, that is where one comes in contact with existence.</p><p><br></p><p>It is not by becoming knowledgeable that you will know, it is by
becoming innocent that you will know. The third question:</p><p>Question 3</p><p><br></p><p>WHY ARE METHODS NEEDED WHEN RELEASEMENT CAN HAPPEN INSTANTLY,
HERENOW? I AM SO TIRED OF TRIPS. HOW MANY MORE MUST I TRY ONLY TO FIND?
THEY DON’T WORK EITHER? I KNOW THE PROBLEM IS IN ME AND I KNOW THERE IS
NO PROBLEM. SO NOW WHAT?</p><p><br></p><p>Celebrate now. Sing, dance, love, be.</p><p>You say: WHY ARE METHODS NEEDED WHEN RELEASEMENT CAN HAPPEN
INSTANTLY, HERENOW?</p><p><br></p><p>Because you cannot trust me, that’s why. You cannot trust me. I go on
declaring that you are Buddhas, already enlightened, but you are
sceptical about it. You can believe – that too very grudgingly – that a
Gautam Buddha may have become enlightened, maybe, perhaps. A Jesus
became enlightened, maybe. You can grudgingly concede that much, but to
concede that you are enlightened is too much. You cannot give such a
gift to yourself; you are so against yourself, you are so condemnatory
towards yourself. You can immediately accept it if somebody says that
you are a sinner. Just think of it; if somebody says you are a sinner,
you are ready to bow down. Even if on the surface you deny it, deep down
you know that he is right because from the very beginning you have been
taught – you have been poisoned – that you are a sinner. The teaching
has gone into your very blood and bones and marrow; it has become part
of you that ‘you are a sinner’. All the religions of the world have been
teaching this; for centuries, generations upon generations have been
doing only one work: condemning man.</p><p><br></p><p>You are not even aware of the self-condemnation that you have for
yourself, the hate that you have for yourself You don’t love yourself,
how can you allow yourself to be a Buddha?</p><p><br></p><p>Releasement can happen this moment, but you won’t allow it, hence
methods are needed. If people can trust me, then there is no need for
any method. The method is not going to help the releasement. Let me
remind you, the method is only going to help you trust me. So I send you
into therapy groups. Teertha and Divya and Siddha and Amitabh and
Pradeepa – these people will work on you. They will help only one thing:
they will help you to trust me.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole function of therapy groups here is totally different than
it is in the West; it has a totally different meaning and significance.
It is to create trust, it is to create a little love for yourself, it is
to create acceptance. Then I send you into meditations; those
meditations are cathartic.</p><p><br></p><p>A cathartic meditation is just throwing all the repressed energy that
is boiling in you, that won’t allow you to trust. Dynamic, Kundalini,
and others will take away much energy that hinders; it will be released.
Slowly slowly you will become capable of trusting. It is only because of
lack of trust that methods have to be invented. If you trust already,
then there is no need for any method.</p><p><br></p><p>You ask me: WHY ARE METHODS NEEDED WHEN RELEASEMENT CAN HAPPEN
INSTANTLY HERENOW?</p><p><br></p><p>Releasement will always happen instantly; whether it happens today or
tomorrow it will always happen instantly, suddenly. It is a sudden
experience, a lightning, and the whole past disappears; you are abruptly
cut from the past, you become discontinuous with it. The old disappears
and the new is born. And the new is not a modification of The old; it
has no relationship with the old, it is simply unrelated with the old.
The old has not caused it either, it is not an effect of the old, it is
utterly unrelated with the old.</p><p><br></p><p>Krishnamurti has been saying the same thing for at least fifty years,
but nothing much has happened. He goes on saying that it is possible
just now – be aware, be awake. And people go on listening, because the
problem is they cannot trust Krishnamurti that this can be just now.
Their minds are</p><p>spinning and weaving inside ‘This is not possible – how can it be
possible? What will happen to my past karmas? I have to undo them. And
what about all the crimes and the sins I have committed? I have to be
punished for them. And what about the Judgement Day? How can it happen
right now?’ Deep inside these unconscious rumblings go on and on. And
you go on listening...</p><p><br></p><p>Seeing the failure of Krishnamurti, I have invented methods. I am
saying essentially the same thing, because the message cannot be
different. But I had to invent methods so that they can destroy your
mistrust. Methods will help you to become unblocked; they will help you
to become more flowing, they will help you to be less frozen – they will
melt you, they will warm up the process of your being.</p><p><br></p><p>Releasement is going to happen instantly, any moment it is going to
happen. But if you are ready, it can happen this very moment – not even
a single moment more do you have to wait.</p><p><br></p><p>WHY ARE METHODS NEEDED WHEN RELEASEMENT CAN HAPPEN INSTANTLY,
HERENOW?</p><p><br></p><p>Because of you, not because of me. From my side I am very much
puzzled why it is not happening to you. It should happen, why is it not
happening? Why do you go on listening without understanding it? Why do
you listen only intellectually? Why can’t you listen from the heart,
from your totality? It is a constant wonder to me – a miracle – that
people can go on listening every day and can remain the same, hence the
methods. The methods are not for the releasement, you are not going to
become enlightened through any meditation, no; nobody has ever become
enlightened through any meditation, but the meditations help. In a
negative way they help; they remove the rocks and the stream starts
flowing. They don’t create the stream, they can’t create it – how can
rocks create the stream? They have nothing to do with the nature of the
stream, but they can prevent it.</p><p><br></p><p>Because there are things which are preventing you from trusting the
moment, trusting God, trusting life, trusting existence, you are shrunk
in fear, in doubt. In doubt and fear you have armoured yourself just to
be secure, safe; you have created a great armour around yourself. Your
body is no more an opening to existence; it has become closed. Your
windows, your doors, are all closed. The sun rises – yes, the sun rises
in the evening – but it cannot penetrate in you. It goes on rising, it
goes on knocking on your door, but the knock is subtle – so subtle, so
silent, that you cannot hear it in your noisy mind, in that constant
chatter that goes on inside you.</p><p><br></p><p>These methods are negative methods; they will not give you
enlightenment, but they will remove the barriers. And once the barriers
are removed, once all the barriers are removed, enlightenment happens.
It is nothing that you have to achieve; when you are available... the
release, the liberation.</p><p><br></p><p>You say: I AM SO TIRED OF TRIPS.</p><p><br></p><p>Really? I don’t think so. If one is really tired, then one’s trips
are finished. You are still hoping – maybe there is still some trip,
some way of tripping so that you can attain. You are still hoping. You
are looking out of the corner of the eye. ‘Maybe I have failed
ninety-nine times; but who knows ? I may succeed the hundredth time. I
have failed up to now, but who knows? I may be trying the wrong methods,
and there may be some right method. I have failed because I may have
been with wrong Masters, and there may be some right Master. I have
failed because I have not put all of my energy into it; if I put all of
my energy into it I may succeed. I have failed because the time was not
ripe for it and now the time may be ripe.’ And a thousand and one
excuses you can always find when you</p><p>want to go on a new trip. If you are really tired, then who is
preventing you? Then forget all about trips, relax, celebrate, be.</p><p><br></p><p>I AM SO TIRED OF TRIPS. HOW MANY MORE MUST I TRY ONLY TO FIND THEY
DON’T WORK EITHER?</p><p><br></p><p>Nothing ever works, nothing has ever worked, because nothing is
needed for it to work. Life is going perfectly well – there is no need
to do anything whatsoever. But this vision comes slowly slowly, when you
have failed again and again and again. It sinks in very slowly. Our
minds are very stubborn, hard, rock-like; they are not soft soil – they
don’t allow anything to sink in easily. Hence sometimes it takes lives
for a person to realize that nothing ever works. And that is a great
moment when one realizes that nothing ever works, nothing can work. ‘My
whole effort to attain was absolutely wrong from the very beginning. It
was wrong because what I am trying to achieve is already the case. It is
wrong because I am searching and it is already there inside me.’</p><p><br></p><p>All efforts are meaningless. If a person is intelligent, he will
understand it soon. If he is not intelligent, he will take a little
longer; it depends on your intelligence. A very intelligent person,
attentive, alert, aware, will see the point in a single moment; with a
single blow his head will disappear. He will see the point and all is
finished – all misery, all hell, all search.</p><p><br></p><p>I AM SO TIRED OF TRIPS, you say. HOW MANY MORE MUST I TRY ONLY TO
FIND THEY DON’T WORK EITHER?</p><p><br></p><p>It all depends on you. You can make a trip out of me</p><p><br></p><p>Now, the question is from Hal Duggan, and he is taking sannyas on the
twentieth. It depends on you; that too can become a trip. From my side
it is not; it is the end of all trips. It is just a declaration that
enough is enough. Sannyas is a declaration that ‘I am not going into any
more trips’, that all methods have failed, and all paths have failed,
that all paths lead astray, that ‘I am not going to be caught into any
method, into any path, anymore.’ Sannyas is a renunciation of all
methods, all paths, all trips – psychedelic or otherwise.</p><p><br></p><p>But you can also make sannyas a trip – it depends on you – and then
you will miss again. Sannyas is not a trip. It is the realization that
all trips are bound to fail. It is coming out of all trips, it is coming
home. It is realizing the fact that you don’t waste your energy and time
in searching for anything anymore, you don’t go on waiting for anything
to happen in the future, because it is already happening – it has always
been happening. Dance, sing, celebrate, be.</p><p><br></p><p>God is, he has not to be searched for. God already is, you are not to
discover him. All you have to do is dance a mad dance, you have to dance
in such a mad way that all the doors are thrown open. You have to sing
with such totality that the ego dissolves into that totality. You have
to be in prayer, in gratitude, with such passion and intensity that the
whole starts flowing towards you; your waiting becomes a magnetic
field.</p><p><br></p><p>Sannyas is not a trip. So, Hal Duggan, remember it, it is not a trip.
Don’t reduce sannyas to a trip.</p><p><br></p><p>I am not a trip. I am not here to create new bondages for you, I am
here to make you free, totally free. That’s why I don’t give you any
discipline, I give you only awareness. That’s why I don’t give you</p><p>any character, I give you only alertness. And out of alertness if a
character arises, good. And out of awareness a character certainly
arises, but a very fluid and flowing character. It is not a fixed mode
of life, because all modes are dead, stagnant. A character arises out of
consciousness, but the consciousness goes on changing, so the character
goes on changing; the consciousness goes on reflecting each moment the
new reality that is happening, and the character goes on corresponding
to the new reality that is happening. There is continuous adjustment,
spontaneous adjustment, between you and the whole.</p><p><br></p><p>The people who have fixed characters are always maladjusted, because
they have a fixed character and life has no fixed character. God is
characterless, and if you have a character you will never meet God,
because your character will confine you into a certain strait jacket;
you will become a stereotype, you will not be a living being anymore;
you will be a noun not a verb.</p><p><br></p><p>God is a verb not a noun. God is a process, a dynamism; and a man of
character, the so-called man of character, is dull, dead. He has to be
dull and dead, because if he were aware he would have to see the changes
that are happening around him and he would have to change accordingly.
He has to remain drugged in his unconsciousness, he has to remain fixed
with his character because he is always afraid that something may happen
and he may have to change his character. He does not want to change his
character so he goes on remaining unaware of all that is changing. He
also creates a society which is unchanging. That’s why in the East the
society has remained unchanging, it is because of the so-called
‘character’-obsession. If a man has to have a fixed character, then the
society has also to be a fixed pattern; only then will he be adjusted,
otherwise there will be difficulty.</p><p>In the East thousands of years have passed and things have remained
almost the same; they have not changed – they have not been allowed to
change because then there is fear. And that’s what is happening in the
West now: because things are changing, people are losing character, and
the Western religious leaders are very much worried. Life is changing
fast; science has released so many energies that life goes on changing.
And one has to change with it, one has to keep pace with life. And if
one has to keep pace with life, one cannot stay in a fixed mode. It is
very easy to live in an Indian village and remain in a fixed mode; it is
very difficult to live in New York with a fixed mode of life – you have
to be more fluid.</p><p><br></p><p>So the Eastern people think that Western people don’t have any
character. What the reality is in fact is that the West has become more
alive, more changing, and the East is still dull and dead, fixated,
obsessed and afraid. ‘If anything changes on the outside then I will
have to change inside too, because my inside has to correspond with the
outside.’</p><p><br></p><p>Small changes bring difficulties. For example, since electricity came
to India, many Jainas have started eating in the night. Now, for
centuries they have not eaten in the night – they had a fixed mode – but
when electricity came, suspicions arose, doubts arose. Now, what is the
problem? Electricity is there, light is there – there is no fear of any
insect or any ant entering into your food – you will not be killing
anything. Now in the night you can have more light than you have in the
day, so many Jainas started eating in the night. Now, what is the
problem? And when one thing falls, then other things start falling,
because everything is connected; all things are connected with each
other. If you can eat in the night and Mahavir is wrong about it, maybe
he is wrong about other things too.</p><p>That’s why the church has been fighting against science, because it
creates suspicion. The church has believed that the earth is flat, and
then science started saying it is not flat, it is a globe. Now,</p><p>if Jesus is wrong about one thing, why can’t he be wrong about other
things ? Then he is no more infallible; suspicion will arise. He may be
wrong about God too, he may be wrong about the Judgement Day, he may be
absolutely wrong, who knows? because he is fallible.</p><p><br></p><p>Religions have always insisted that nothing should change; these
religions are all in the service of death. I am giving you a totally new
vision: a religion of life not of death, a religion of intelligence not
of stupidity, a religion of dynamism not of stagnancy, a religion which
will keep you flowing with the flow of the total and will not in any way
hold you back from the movement of the total. It will keep you in tune
with the whole. I don’t give a character to you, I only give
consciousness. My whole emphasis is on consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>Sitting is Zen, walking is Zen, talking is Zen, being silent is Zen.
All should be only awareness. Awareness should be your God. Let
awareness be the only fundamental law, and then you will be out of all
trips; otherwise, it is difficult. You can go on changing from one trip
to another. A Christian can become a Hindu; this is just changing the
train – the trip remains. A Hindu can become a Christian, and nothing
changes, only words; he will not go to the temple, he will go to the
church.</p><p><br></p><p>And the same can be done with me too, but remember that will be your
responsibility. I can also become a trip to you. I don’t want to become
a trip to you, I want to become a liberation to you. From my side I want
you to be liberated, but still, your cooperation will be needed. The
very idea of liberation, and you can catch hold of it and make a trip
out of it. And your mind is very very efficient in making trips out of
everything. Beware.</p><p><br></p><p>Hal Duggan, on the twentieth you are going to become a sannyasin.
Remember, this is not a trip, this is the end of all trips. Let it be
the end of all trips. How long are you going to journey and journey and
journey? Now, come home. Now, come to rest. Enough of the trips. Learn
from me how to rest, how to relax, how to be.</p><p><br></p><p>The fourth question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 4</p><p><br></p><p>LAST NIGHT I HAD THIS DREAM: IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, THE SUN
APPEARED, COMPLETELY OUT OF ITS PLACE. THIS FILLED ME WITH A SACRED
TERROR WHICH WAS OUTSIDE OF ANY DREAM. BUT AT THE CENTRE OF THE TERROR
CAME THE REMEMBRANCE OF YOU AND THE STATE YOU REPRESENT, WHICH IS BEYOND
ALL FEAR, AND IT VANISHED, LEAVING ME IN AN EMPTINESS FOR SOME MOMENT. I
FELT I UNDERSTOOD A LITTLE OF HOW LOVING YOU MADLY CAN ENABLE ME TO GO
ANYWHERE!</p><p><br></p><p>Anadideva, this is a beautiful experience.</p><p><br></p><p>Modern researchers, particularly dream researchers, have stumbled
upon a new kind of dream just recently; they call it the breakthrough
dream. This is a breakthrough dream. The normal dream, the ordinary
dream, and the breakthrough dream are totally different dreams. This is
the difference, this is of great importance to you, to you all. If you
can bring this quality to the dream, you will be able to go beyond
dreaming.</p><p>A breakthrough dream is a dream in which some kind of awareness
arises in you. The ordinary dream is unconscious, passive; you simply go
on watching – no awareness arises in you – you are simply identified
With the dream. You don’t remember a thing, you don’t remember yourself;
you are not aware at all, you are lost in the dream. The ordinary dream
possesses you. The breakthrough dream is different: it is not passive,
it is active; it is not just possessing you, you remain in some way
alert in it.</p><p><br></p><p>Gurdjieff used to teach his disciples about such dreaming. This is a
key to work deeper into your consciousness. He used to say to his
disciples ‘Try to remember yourself in the dream, and the only way to do
it is if you remember the whole day, only then you can remember.’ So the
method was that the person who was given this work had to remember
continuously the whole day. Walking on the street he remembers ‘This is
a dream. All these shops, these people, this man passing by, this noise
– all this is a dream. This woman who looks so beautiful is a dream.
This tree is a dream.’ The whole day the man continues thinking ‘This is
dream, this is dream’; he repeats it millions of times – ‘This is
dream’. Naturally, the idea that this is dream penetrates more and more
into his unconscious, and soon it is transferred to the conscious. Then,
one day, suddenly – it takes three to six months of constant repeating
‘This is dream, this is dream, this is dream’ – one day, suddenly, in
dream, he remembers this is dream, and that very moment, a new energy
has entered into dreaming, he is alert, aware.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is not a new method. In the East, we have used it for
centuries. In fact, The whole idea that the world is maya is nothing but
a philosophic statement of this technique. ‘The world is maya’ means the
world is dream. You have to remember it: ‘This is a dream, this is a
dream, this is a dream’; and, then, one day, in a dream, you remember
this is a dream. And then, suddenly, there is a gap between you and the
dream. The dream is there, you are here, and there is a gap – you have
awakened in the dream. And the moment you awaken in the dream, the dream
loses all vitality, it disappears; it starts disappearing, and great
emptiness arises.</p><p><br></p><p>This is what has happened to you, Anadideva: you have stumbled upon a
breakthrough dream.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the other day I was talking about four stages of consciousness:
waking, dreaming, deep sleep, and TURIYA, the fourth. Ordinarily you
remain in the waking, because you can’t even remember in waking; your
waking is almost asleep. You are only awake for the name’s sake. Very
rarely are you awake even when you are in a wakeful state – very rarely.
If somebody comes up suddenly with a revolver in his hand and puts the
revolver on your chest, maybe for a moment you will become alert. Those
moments in your whole life can be counted on fingers.</p><p><br></p><p>Once I was travelling with a friend and the car fell into a river.
The friend was driving. When the car fell, just for a few seconds
everybody in the car became alert that it was going to fall, because
somehow the brake was not working, and the speed was such that on a
certain turn it became absolutely clear that now... Everybody in the car
became alert that it was finished. And the next moment we were all in
the dry bed – it was summer time – and the car was upside down. The
moment we came out... nobody was hurt, but everybody was transformed.
The man who was driving told me ‘You have been talking about awareness,
awareness, awareness, and I have been listening to you for years. Now,
for the first time, I felt what you mean by awareness. For a moment,
just on the verge of falling, I became aware; now I know what it is. All
became silent. Although death was so close all was utter bliss.’</p><p>Very rarely do you become aware. But if you start trying to become
aware – that is what VIPASSANA is: an effort to be aware, watching,
watching each act that you are doing – slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly,
very slowly, you start feeling a new kind of awareness, a new kind of
presence. That presence makes you a different kind of individual – more
integrated, more centred.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the other day I told you the story of the Buddhist monk who was
invited by the prostitute to live with her for four months in the rainy
season. Now, Prabuddha has asked a question, and he says the story was
ugly. ‘Why could the Buddhist monk not move in love-making with the
prostitute? Why was he afraid?’</p><p><br></p><p>He was not afraid. And the story is not ugly. Maybe Prabuddha became
too interested in Amrapalli and her beauty. Prabuddha must have started
thinking ‘If I had been there... I would not have missed! And this
foolish monk... and what was wrong in it?’ It is not a question of wrong
or right. But the monk was so centred, the monk was so present in
himself, that all that the prostitute was doing to attract him must have
looked to him very juvenile, foolish, silly. What the prostitute was
doing to enchant him was great from the side of the prostitute. She was
an artist in that art of alluring people, of hypnotizing people. And she
was a beautiful woman. It is said that she was the next most famous
person in Buddha’s time – the first was Buddha and Amrapalli was the
second.</p><p>But if the monk is centred and has no feeling arising in him to go
into love-making, why should he go? If he has transcended, why should he
go? It is not that he was resisting; if he were resisting or repressing
then it would be ugly. But why should he indulge if there is no desire
in him? Just because of the prostitute? Why docs the story look ugly to
Prabuddha? No, he was very kind to the woman, infinitely kind,
infinitely loving. But, of course, the love of a centred man is totally
different from the love of an uncentred man. He was a Buddha, that’s why
Buddha had allowed him to go. He had arrived; all desiring had
disappeared from him. Now it was just a toy.</p><p><br></p><p>And the story is immensely beautiful, because remaining centred, he
helped the woman. He really must have loved the woman, because that is
the greatest gift he could have given to her. If he had become involved,
the woman would have thrown him out sooner or later. If he had become
involved, the woman would have never gone to Buddha to become a
disciple. This was the greatest gift that the monk could have given to
the woman – the gift of Buddha, the gift of disciplehood. He made
himself absolutely available for the woman to watch, to see, in every
possible way. He made his presence felt, and the woman came to know that
this was something to be achieved, this was something worthwhile. All
that she had been doing up to now was worthless, insignificant, non-
essential. This man had essential richness – the richness of the
essence. She fell in love with the monk on a higher plane; she fell in
love not only with the monk but she fell in love with SAMADHI, with
enlightenment.</p><p>In fact, that was the reason for the beauty of the monk. She had not
gone into love because of the monk, the monk was a vehicle, the energy
was that of enlightenment, he was luminous. She had fallen in love with
that luminousness. The body of the monk was just like a lamp and the
luminousness inside was the flame. You don’t fall in love with the lamp,
you fall in love with the flame. If the monk had moved, the flame would
have disappeared and the woman would have found an ordinary man – very
ordinary, nothing special about him, nothing valuable about him.</p><p><br></p><p>The more the monk remained centred... And when I say remained centred
I am not saying he was making any effort to remain centred. He was
centred; it was effortless, it was spontaneous, it was</p><p>natural. If there were any effort involved, the monk himself would
have been afraid to go. He was not afraid; he slept in the same room
with the woman. And the woman danced naked around him, and he sat in
silence and meditated there. He remained alone. The woman must have
tried in every possible way – it was a challenge, it was a great
challenge to her beauty. It was humiliating in a way, insulting in a
way; she must have felt hurt, her ego must have felt hurt. She tried in
every way to seduce the monk but failed again and again and again. Then
she must have realized that he had some other kind of beauty, he had
some other kind of presence. And she became enchanted with that space;
she followed him, and became a disciple of Buddha. She became
enlightened soon. Amrapalli was one of the enlightened disciples of
Buddha.</p><p><br></p><p>The monk loved the woman, that’s why with great kindness and
compassion he made his presence available. There is nothing ugly in it;
it is absolutely beautiful. The monk was a benediction, a blessing.</p><p><br></p><p>But you go on moving in life, attracted by this thing and that; you
are unaware. If you become aware, your attractions will start dropping,
disappearing. And when you become aware in the dream, the dream
disappears immediately, and there arises great silence. That silence is
the third state, SUSHUPTI, deep sleep.</p><p><br></p><p>A breakthrough dream means that you have moved into the third – and
with a little bit of consciousness. That is a great experience, that is
the first approach into the deepest layer of your being. Beyond that
there is only one state more, TURIYA.</p><p><br></p><p>Patanjali has said that deep sleep is closest to SAMADHI; it is. If
you take one step more, you are a Buddha. SAMADHI IS the centre, turiya
is the centre; around that centre the first layer is of sleep, the
second layer is of dreaming, the third layer is of your so-called
waking. You have to go deeper and deeper. Waking is the farthest from
TURIYA, dreaming is a little closer. That’s why psychoanalysis goes into
your dreaming. Rather than thinking about your waking experiences,
psychoanalysis goes into your dreaming, because there you are more true,
more honest, more simple, more natural. Yoga goes a little deeper, it
goes into SUSHUPTI, deep sleep.</p><p><br></p><p>A breakthrough dream is a dream which takes you to SUSHUPTI. And
after SUSHUPTI there is only a single step more; Zen and Tantra take you
into that single step.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a beautiful dream, Anadideva. I will read it again.</p><p><br></p><p>LAST NIGHT I HAD THIS DREAM: IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, THE SUN
APPEARED, COMPLETELY OUT OF ITS PLACE. THIS FILLED ME WITH A SACRED
TERROR WHICH WAS OUTSIDE OF ANY DREAM. BUT AT THE CENTRE OF THIS TERROR
CAME THE REMEMBRANCE OF YOU AND THE STATE YOU REPRESENT, WHICH IS BEYOND
ALL FEAR...</p><p><br></p><p>This is beautiful that you could remember me in your dream. Every
disciple has to learn that. I have to be with you not only in your
waking but in your dreaming too. And if I am there, dreaming will
disappear. The very remembrance will disconnect you with the dreaming
layer.</p><p><br></p><p>BUT AT THE CENTRE OF THIS TERROR CAME THE REMEMBRANCE OF YOU AND THE
STATE YOU REPRESENT, WHICH IS BEYOND ALL FEAR, AND IT VANISHED, LEAVING
ME IN AN EMPTINESS FOR SOME MOMENTS.</p><p>Those moments of emptiness are of the third state, SHUSHUPTI, deep
sleep. Now, try to do it again and again. Every night when you go to
sleep, go with this thought vibrating in you, pulsating in you: ‘If
there is a dream, I will remember.’ Remember me. While you are falling
asleep, go on remembering so that it soaks into your sleep. While you
are changing from waking to dreaming, let it be there – a subtle
presence – and then slowly slowly you can transform all your normal
dreams into breakthrough dreams, and each dream will lead you into the
third state, deep sleep. And when you can be aware in deep sleep – even
for a few moments – you are coming closer home. Then, one day, you will
be able to remember me even in that emptiness, and that very day the sky
opens up, that very moment the sun really rises in the evening.</p><p><br></p><p>It is very symbolic that you saw the sun rising in the middle of the
night; it was in the dream state. Soon it will happen if you can
remember me in the deep sleep beyond which nothing can be said, but
beyond which all is, God is.</p><p><br></p><p>The last question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 5 OOOH OSHO!</p><p>THE WHOLE LIFE WATERFALLING ON ME!</p><p><br></p><p>HEAVEN AND EARTH, WORK AND PLAY, EVERYTHING I HAVE EVER BEEN AND
DONE, ALL THINGS I</p><p>HAVE EVER WANTED TO WILL BE,</p><p><br></p><p>PAST AND FUTURE SWELLING SWELLING IN BALLOON DANCING NOW!</p><p>THIS ENLIGHTENMENT IS SOME CRAZY BUSINESS!</p><p>Crazy baby, crazy... absolutely crazy! But don’t be afraid. Go into
it, and soon you will see the sanity of insanity, soon you will see that
it is not crazy. You have been crazy all along before it. It looks crazy
compared to your life that has happened up to now. People are living in
madness, so when they come closer and closer to some inner light,
compared to their life it looks crazy. Once it settles, the whole of
life looks crazy, and only this light, this awareness, looks sane.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha was sane, although he himself was worried many times that he
had gone crazy. Others were also saying that he had gone crazy.
Naturally, when all are competing in the world, and everybody is rushing
towards money, power, and prestige, and you start moving away from all
this nonsense; when everybody is going extrovert, and you start moving
inwards; when everybody is going in one direction and you start moving
in the polar opposite direction, diametrically opposite direction, it
looks crazy.</p><p>Once it happened...</p><p><br></p><p>A drunkard was driving on a one-way street and was going in the wrong
direction. He was puzzled, because everybody was going the other way.
The policeman stopped him and asked him ‘Where are you going?’</p><p><br></p><p>He said ‘That I don’t know. One thing is certain, that wherever I am
going I am late because everybody is coming back!’</p><p><br></p><p>When you start moving towards meditation, suddenly the whole world,
everybody, is going one way and you are going in the opposite direction.
And everybody looks at you with suspicion ‘Where are you going?’ You
will also look with suspicion at yourself, and the idea will arise again
and again ‘Have I gone crazy?’</p><p><br></p><p>But one has to learn one thing: if you are feeling happy, don’t be
worried, because craziness cannot give you happiness. If you are feeling
less tense, don’t be worried, because craziness will give you more
tension, more anxiety. If you are feeling more together, don’t be
worried, then you are on the right track – you are moving towards
well-being, you are moving towards wholeness.</p><p><br></p><p>And that is what is happening, Punita.</p><p><br></p><p>You say: THE WHOLE LIFE WATERFALLING ON ME! HEAVEN AND EARTH, WORK
AND PLAY, EVERYTHING I HAVE EVER BEEN AND DONE, ALL THINGS I</p><p>HAVE EVER WANTED TO WILL BE,</p><p><br></p><p>PAST AND FUTURE SWELLING SWELLING IN BALLOON DANCING NOW!</p><p>Look at the beauty of the dance. Look at the benediction of nature
falling like a waterfall on you. Look at the expanding consciousness
swelling, swelling; it will fill the who!e sky soon – even the sky is
not the limit.</p><p><br></p><p>THIS ENLIGHTENMENT IS SOME CRAZY BUSINESS!</p><p>It is, but the people who become involved in this crazy business are
the only sane people, because theirs is the kingdom of God. Blessed are
the mad, for theirs is the kingdom of God.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part7>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

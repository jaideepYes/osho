‌CHAPTER 1
Always at Ease, Unmoved
11 June 1978 am in Buddha Hall
DO YOU NOT SEE HIM,
THE REALLY WISE MAN, ALWAYS AT EASE, UNMOVED? HE DOES NOT GET RID OF ILLUSION, NOR DOES HE SEEK FOR THE (SO-CALLED) TRUTH.
IGNORANCE IS INTRINSICALLY THE BUDDHA NATURE, OUR ILLUSORY UNREAL BODY IS THE COSMIC BODY. GETTING RID OF THINGS AND CLINGING TO EMPTINESS IS AN ILLNESS OF THE SAME KIND;</description>

‌CHAPTER 10
It is not too Late
20 June 1978 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
THE WEST HAS GIVEN BIRTH TO ARISTOTLE, NIETZSCHE, HEIDEGGER, CAMUS, BERDYAEV, MARCEL AND SARTRE. IS IT GOING TO GIVE BIRTH TO BUDDHAS BY ITSELF OR IS A COMMUNION WITH THE EASTERN CONSCIOUSNESS NEEDED?
CHINMAYA, THE BUDDHA-CONSCIOUSNESS is neither Eastern nor Western. It has nothing to do with geography or history, it has nothing to do with mind as such.</description>

‌CHAPTER 2
Waiting, Just Waiting
12 June 1978 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
A PEBBLE FALLING INTO WATER RIPPLES THE FAR SHORE.
A SPARK FANNED BY THE BREEZE STARTS A FOREST FIRE.
A MASTER’S PRESENCE SPREADS AWARENESS TO THE FAR CORNERS OF THE EARTH.
OSHO, WHAT IS YOUR WORK?
KABIR, IT IS NOT WORK AT ALL. The very idea of work is irrelevant with me.</description>

‌CHAPTER 3
Cutting off the Root
13 June 1978 am in Buddha Hall
CUTTING OFF THE ROOT (OF LIFE AND DEATH) DIRECTLY, THIS IS THE MARK OF BUDDHAHOOD;
IF YOU GO ON PLUCKING LEAVES (OF CREEDS) AND SEEKING BRANCHES (OF ABSTRACT PRINCIPLES),
I CAN DO NOTHING FOR YOU. DO NOT SEEK FOR THE TRUTH, DO NOT CUT OFF DELUSIONS.
TRYING TO GET RID OF ILLUSION, AND SEEKING TO GRASP REALITY, THIS GIVING UP AND KEEPING</description>

‌CHAPTER 4
Learn to Breathe this Air
14 June 1978 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
WHAT IF THERE ARE ONLY MIRRORS AND MIRRORS AND MIRRORS REFLECTING EACH OTHER?
PRABUDDHA, IT IS SO. That s precisely how it is, because all is consciousness.
Consciousness is a mirror – a mirror reflecting mirrors. When your consciousness is clean, clear, unobsessed by anything, unoccupied, this is how one realizes reality.</description>

‌CHAPTER 5
When we Attain to Reality...
15 June 1978 am in Buddha Hall
THE MOON REFLECTED IN THE STREAM, THE WIND BLOWING THROUGH THE PINES
IN THE COOL OF THE EVENING, IN THE DEEP MIDNIGHT, – WHAT IS IT FOR?
WHEN WE ATTAIN REALITY, IT IS SEEN TO BE NEITHER
PERSONAL NOR IMPERSONAL.
THERE IS NO SIN, NO PARADISE, NO LOSS OR GAIN; ABOUT THIS TRANSCENDENTALITY, NO QUESTIONS!</description>

‌CHAPTER 6
This is How it Comes
16 June 1978 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
HOW DO I FIND MY WAY?
RASHID, THERE IS NO WAY TO BE FOUND, and there is no one to find it – and there is no need either. The very idea of the way misleads, misguides. The way is possible only if God is far away; if there is a distance between you and the truth, then the way is needed to connect, to bridge.</description>

‌CHAPTER 7
The Essence is at Ease...
17 June 1978 am in Buddha Hall
HE ALWAYS WALKS BY HIMSELF; SAUNTERS BY HIMSELF:
FROM THE TIME I RECOGNIZED THE ROAD, I REALIZED I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH BIRTH AND DEATH.
WALKING IS ZEN, SITTING IS ZEN;
TALKING OR SILENT, MOVING UNMOVING, – THE ESSENCE IS AT EASE.
ENTERING THE DEEP MOUNTAINS I LIVE IN QUIET SOLITUDE.</description>

‌CHAPTER 8
Enough of the Trips
18 June 1978 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
PLEASE HELP ME TO BE HAPPY, TO BE ORDINARY. I FIND THAT ALL MY UPSETS, CONFLICTS, TURMOILS, HAVE TO DO WITH THIS DESIRE TO BE SPECIAL AND NOTHING ELSE.
SUDHA, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO HELP because you are not ordinary – nobody is, nobody can be.</description>

‌CHAPTER 9
It never leaves this place
19 June 1978 am in Buddha Hall
WE GET RID OF ILLUSION AND ACQUIRE THE TRUTH, BUT THIS IS DISCRIMINATION;
OUR MIND IS CLEVERLY FALSE.
ALL PRINCIPLES ARE NO PRINCIPLES; THEY HAVE NO RELATION
TO SPIRITUAL PERCEPTION.
IT NEVER LEAVES THIS PLACE, AND IS ALWAYS PERFECT. WHEN YOU LOOK FOR IT,
YOU FIND YOU CAN’T SEE IT.</description>

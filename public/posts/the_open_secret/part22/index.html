It is there, mm? -- something is there that you cannot catch hold of. It is not only that you cannot say it, you cannot verbalize it even within yourself, because that which can be verbalized within can be said too; whether you say it inside or you say it outside makes not much difference. But there are things which are beyond the grasp of the mind. You can only feel them, you cannot think them.\nYou have a kind of consciousness that they are there, but it is very vague, a great mist surrounds it. It is as if the morning sun has not risen yet and it is all misty. You cannot see but still you can see a little bit; it is not completely dark. You cannot say that you cannot see and you cannot say what it is that you are seeing; it is just in the middle. It is not in the head, it is not in the heart, it is just in the middle. So the head can have a kind of consciousness about it. It is lurking on the boundaries of the head but it cannot pinpoint it, it cannot figure it out.\nSoon it will become possible. Help it: whenever you are sitting silently, think about it, about what it is.\nAllow your heart to have a dialogue with your head. That will bridge your head and heart, and if they can be bridged it is immensely enriching.\nIt is very easy to live in the head. Millions of people are living there; that is the only kind of space they know. It is very difficult to live in the heart because the heart does not pay. But though it is difficult, it is possible. A few people live in the heart -- the poets, the lovers, the painters, the artists. But the real and the greatest thing is to bridge both and to live in such a way that neither the head interferes with the heart nor the heart interferes with the head.\nThen you attain to a third centre which is in control of both. You become a triangle, you become a trinity, and when you become a trinity and the third point has arisen, in the East we call it witnessing. One is thinking -- the head -- another is feeling -- the heart -- and the third is witnessing -- awareness of both with no choice. One is not choosing the heart against the head, one is not choosing the head against the heart at the cost of the heart. One is not choosing at all; one is simply watchful, aware of both. In that watchfulness both meet and a new centre arises in your being; that's really the soul. To go beyond the heart and the head is to enter into the soul.\nSo try to understand it. The message from the heart is there; it has not penetrated the head yet. Only the head can have a kind of understanding about it. The heart is dumb, the head is vocal. There are people who go on talking without exactly knowing what they are talking about; the head is vocal. The heart feels. It knows what it is that is worth saying but it has no language.\nYou must have heard an old ancient fable.… In a forest there used to live two men, two beggars -- one was blind, another was lame. They were friends, they needed each other because the blind could not see and the lame could not walk. So this was the arrangement between them, a synthesis, that the blind would carry the lame on his shoulders so that the lame could see and the blind could walk. It was going perfectly well.\nOne day the forest caught fire and each started trying to escape without the help of the other. They forgot for a moment; the danger was so much that they forgot their partnership and that it was essential for their existence. Soon they realised their mistake. Both were in danger, both could have been killed by the fire. But just in time they recognised that alone, separate, there was no way to survive. They searched for each other, helped each other and escaped from the forest.\nThat is the situation of the heart and the head. If they are together you can come out of this life that is a 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nforest on fire. So whenever you are sitting silently just listen to the heart. Let heart and head have a dialogue and soon you will see that they are coming closer, becoming more friendly. Once they are close enough things start jumping from the heart into the head. The head is vocal: it knows the language, the logic of how to say a thing. Once the heart has released its energy to the head, the head can express it.\nLet that synthesis happen. Once it happens you will be immensely blessed. For the first time you will find you have become a unity and great joy arises out of unity. Great misery is there when a person is split, and everybody is split. The feelings go on going in one direction and the thinking goes on going in another direction and they don't have any kind of understanding about each other. The man starts falling apart, into pieces, becomes fragmentary, loses all kind of centering. So become a witness to both thinking and feeling and centering will arise... it has to arise. That is your work here.\nAnd whenever you can manage to do groups, enquire -- then I will give you a few groups, mm? Good!\n[A sannyasin has just completed some groups and describes an amazing high space he is in. Then says he is very inquisitive to know what it is.]\nPlease don't try to understand it! Understanding will become a barrier; understanding is not necessarily always a help. When something beyond the mind is happening it is better to let the mind remain quiet.\nUnderstanding or the effort to understand it disturbs the mind, stirs the mind; thoughts start revolving, doubts start arising. It is better not to stir the mind at this moment, otherwise once the mind becomes very active the energy that is moving you higher and higher will disappear; the mind will drag it down.\nIt is better to leave the curiosity as it is. What is happening is good, it is really beautiful. You need not analyse it. Always remember: if you are ill go to the doctor and let it be diagnosed but if you are feeling healthy don't go to the doctor. Illness has to be diagnosed, not health. If you diagnose health you will be in trouble, you will disturb it. When you are feeling bad, miserable, something needs to be done.\nWhen something needs to be done, understanding is needed. Understanding is a tool for doing something, otherwise it is meaningless. When something is going beautifully nothing needs to be done; understanding is not needed. Try to understand a thing when you want to do something; then it is a must.\nBut when nothing is needed to be done you are just to float with it. No effort is needed but a kind of surrender. Then understanding is dangerous.\nIf you try to understand it -- you start conceptualizing, you start labelling and categorizing and you say\n'This is this and that is that, and this is happening'... you will stop the whole process because the energy will start moving into the mind. It is the same energy. Either it can take you higher and higher or it will take you deeper and deeper into analysis. It is the same energy and you won't have enough energy for both. That's why the people who are in the mind too much cannot go high; their energy is involved, occupied.\nSometimes innocent people, peasants and villagers, easily start going higher.\nIt is not just a coincidence that all Jesus' disciples were uneducated, uncultured, innocent, except Judas.\nHe was the only man with a head... and he betrayed Jesus. The other eleven disciples were simply very very ordinary people, with no idea about what was happening; they simply trusted Jesus. Judas betrayed. He was a scholar, a logician, an intellectual; he belonged to the intelligentsia. He could not move with Jesus, he could not participate in his prayers, he could not fly high with him. It was difficult for him to be turned on.\nHe was always thinking, analysing, conceptualizing and philosophizing; hence he missed!\nThese moments are of immense value. The mind has nothing to say about it. The mind has to be utterly quiet, in awe, in a kind of wonder... just silent. When something greater than the mind is happening, the mind has to be silent. Be completely silent. I understand: curiosity is natural, but don't be carried along by it.\nLet it be there but don't cooperate with it and don't ask; just go deeper and deeper.\nA different kind of understanding will arise one day through experience, not through intellect; it will be existential. It will not be analytical, it will be existential. And there is a great difference between analysis and when you understand something existentially. You can take a flower to a chemist; he will understand it analytically.\nAnalysis reduces everything to 'nothing but'. If you take a child, an alive child, to a chemical analyst, he will analyse the child: eighty percent water, twenty percent this... The blood and the bones and the marrow and everything will be accounted for; only the soul of the child will be missing in it. Aliveness will be missed -- and that's what the real thing was. Everything else was just a vehicle for that aliveness, for the soul; everything was just a support for it to exist herenow. The child was anchored in the body but was not the body itself. The child was more than the body, more than the sum total of its parts, but that more cannot 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nbe understood analytically.\nThat more is very close by. Don't analyse; simply go with it, go with it headlong. Let it take you wherever it wants to. There is no need to direct, there is no need to figure out anything; go into the unknown with it. And yes, a kind of understanding will arise. That understanding will be of the poetic approach, not of the analytic. It will be synthetical, not analytical; it will be existential.\nSomething beautiful is on the way. Be thrilled, be in celebration!\nThe Open Secret Chapter #23\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"1894","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_open_secret/part22/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_open_secret/>The Open Secret</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>9 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1894 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Open_Secret/part22.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part21>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

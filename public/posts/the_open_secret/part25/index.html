He is one of the most important saints in Christianity, in fact the next after Jesus. He brings something new to the world. Imbibe that spirit. He brings this spirit, that he is deeply in love with nature, to the world. Christianity has been against nature; that is Francis' rebellion. He is the first man in the West to call rivers sisters and mountains brothers... but he has not been listened to.\nHe is more a Taoist than a Christian; he has the same spirit as Lao Tzu, a kind of great rapport with nature. That is his message. So start talking to trees and rivers and mountains. They are your sisters and brothers because we all come from the same source.\nA dialogue with nature will give you great insight into your being because to talk to a tree is to talk to your own unconscious, and to talk to a rock is to talk to your own body. Man has these four bodies. The first body is just like minerals; it consists of the mineral world. The second body is like the vegetable world, the third body is like the animal world and the fourth body is the human body. The fifth, the divine body, is still a promise; it has to be attained.\nSo when you are in a deep dialogue with a tree you are in a deep dialogue with your own vegetable layer and when you talk to animals you are talking to your own animal past. When you look into the eyes of a dog or a cat or a cow, you are looking into your own past and it has great messages for you. It is your own\nunconscious...\nAnand means bliss, and nirvanam means the ultimate dissolution. One is completely lost, just like a river loses itself into the ocean.\nIn English there is only one word which can become close to it in its root sense; that is the word\n'absolute'. It comes from a Latin root which means dissolution, utter dissolution... when one is not separate, when one has become one with the whole. The latin word 'absolutum' (absolute) is the past participle of\n'absolvere' which means to loosen, dissolve. That is the meaning of nirvanam: a blissful dissolution. And bliss is only when you are not; misery is there if you are there. Misery is another name for the ego; bliss is another name for egolessness.\nSo one can never say 'I am blissful,' no. Linguistically it is possible, existentially it is not. One cannot say existentially 'I am blissful!' 'I am' is always miserable; 'I' is misery. When one is blissful one feels\n'Blissfulness is. Where am I?' Then blissfulness is found and the 'I' is not found at all. You can go on searching for it but you will not find a trace of it. That dissolution is nirvanam. So get lost in bliss... Or get lost and you will be blissful!\n[A sannyasin says he has sadistic fantasies of beating women, but has not acted them out.]\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nAnd you can find a masochistic woman... And if you cannot find just tell me; I know one!\nBut that won't help. Even if you can find a woman, that won't help; it will not bring you out of it. It has something to do with your unconscious; just beating a\nwoman won't help. You can go on beating women your whole life. It may become even more strengthened; acting out won't help. There is some complex inside which has to be loosened.\nYou are angry with your mother, you have not been able to forgive her yet; that is causing the fantasy.\nBeating another woman will not help; that will be a substitute. You will be beating your mother in the form of the woman but you know that she is not your mother. And the fantasy does not stop at beating: it really wants to kill. Beating is just the beginning. Once you have started beating then the fantasy will start coming,\n'Now kill her!'\nAnd this happens. It is very difficult to be brought up rightly, it seems almost impossible. Not only today, it has been so always, and I don't see a possibility that it will ever be much different because in the very nature of things the child has to become angry with the parents, and the parents have to go into situations where they create the anger.\n[Out of necessity parents have to prevent children from doing things that are harmful for them, Osho continues, but the child in his unawareness just hears what seems like a perpetual 'no'... and he begins to build up anger and resentment.]\nThis has to be worked out. By beating a woman nothing will be of...\n[The sannyasin says: During Primal and Encounter I didn't contact any of this anger.]\nIt is there, otherwise that sadistic tendency cannot arise. There are other possibilities also; I'm coming to them. First there is a very very hidden layer of anger. You have not been able yet to forgive your mother in particular. And the problem becomes more complicated because we are taught to respect the mother and the father, so we repress such ideas. We don't allow them to come in front of our consciousness; we go on putting them away. A great barrier has to be created so the idea and the guilt about it never cross the boundary. You never go into the basement, nobody ever does. Unless one goes very very deep into meditation, one never goes into the basement. Things want to come up from the basement\nbut we create barriers so they don't cross. They can cross only in a camouflage. This is a camouflage. They cannot come directly as they are, naked as they are; they can come only with masks.\nThe idea comes, the fantasy comes that beating a woman will be beautiful. Now this is a mask idea; this can pass. Killing the mother or beating the mother will not be allowed by your censors, by your guards. It won't come in, so the idea takes a new form, takes a new shape, wears a mask and then crosses the barrier: it comes as a sadistic tendency.\nIt will look absurd, because why? It has to have some meaning, some explanation why: it becomes sexual, beating becomes a sexual activity. Then the repressed idea to beat the mother or kill the mother joins hands with repressed sexuality. They are both in the basement. They join hands, they join their forces so both can hide in each other. This is the complex, this is how complexes are created. A few repressed ideas join hands together. They start conspiring against you -- they have to: they have never been accepted and they have been always rejected. They want to take revenge so your repressed sexuality and the repressed idea to beat or kill the mother have joined hands. Now the idea of beating a woman has a sexual tinge to it.\nMany people enjoy beating women -- not only enjoy, they get sexually aroused only when they beat. If they can beat, they suddenly become very sexually interested in the woman. So sadism is never a pure sadism; it is always sexual.\nNow that too is joined with the mother. Each boy, some day or other has wanted to make love to the mother and has thought, fantasized about replacing the father. That too has been thrown into the basement, mm? That is very ugly, obscene, criminal, a sin... even to think like that All these things are there. They conspire and they create a new thing which your consciousness cannot recognise: one part from one thing, another part from another thing. It is a new shape, it is a new mechanism: it comes as sadism.\nYou will have to unveil your unconscious. You will have to go there and you will have to face the naked truth. So don't judge and don't condemn: allow your unconscious total freedom to say what it wants to. If the idea comes that you wanted to make love to your mother, don't say, 'No ! That is stupid -- I never wanted 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nto.' Then you will be repressing. Don't say 'This is bad !', otherwise you will be judgemental and again you will throw it back. It is perfectly okay. Every child has thought that, felt that. They may not be alert about it but it has been there.\nSadism is not a single disease. It is many diseases together and that's why it cannot be tackled directly...\nbecause it has such complexity. You cannot tackle it from one aspect; all the aspects have to be understood.\nIt has to be analysed in its separate aspects, watched, observed, and in that very observation you will find the complex is disappearing. That day you will become for the first time mature, that day you will become for the first time free of your parents. That day you are no more your 'mother's good boy'; that day you are on your own. That is the second birth.\nSo just allow it. Actually going into it is not going to help; it may create more problems. But next time you come, if it is difficult for you to allow it, we can make some arrangements, mm? It has to be dissolved, but first you try on your own: just allow it, just go into it very lovingly, with no judgement. And by and by the unconscious will start whispering, first in very very small whispers because it is afraid of you, mm? --\nyou have been so much against it.\nOnce it becomes courageous and knows you are not rejecting any more it will gain courage, voice. It will become strong, it will start talking more clearly, it will become more articulate. And it has great mysteries to reveal to you: it has all the keys of your transformation. Once the basement is vacated completely, once the basement is no more full of all repressed things, once they have all evaporated from there, great freedom and great purity comes -- the purity of emptiness. A very austere beauty arises inside.\nDuring these six months, whenever you have time just sit silently and allow the\nunconscious. Go with it totally, let it have its say, persuade it to say whatsoever it wants to say. Tell it constantly that there is no need to hide, no need to wear masks, no need to come in different forms. It can come directly; there is no condemnation on your part. Say it again and again. By and by the unconscious will gather courage, will come closer.\nIt is almost like a bird; it is so afraid that it remains away. If you allow it a little bit it comes closer; if you give it food then it starts coming closer but watches you. Who knows? this food may be a trick: you may be just trying to trap or kill. But by and by the bird starts learning that you are not an enemy, you are a friend; it comes closer. One day suddenly it is hopping on your shoulder. That's how the unconscious has to be persuaded by and by. You do this, and if it has not happened, then when you come back. Good.\n[A sannyasin says there is a little girl in her who doesn't want to grow up -- perhaps because her parents split up when she was ten. Also she is very clinging in relationship. Osho checks her energy.]\nNothing to be worried about; it is not much of a problem. Just a small energy block is there. It is not very complicated, it can simply dissolve. These groups will do much; and then remind me about how you are feeling when you go. If something is needed then I will give you a technique so you can work; it will simply be gone.\nIt is there: just a small lump, just some energy has become hard there. It must have happened as a survival measure.\nWhen one feels that survival is at stake the heart becomes a little hard, otherwise you cannot protect yourself. You cannot remain vulnerable: you close a little bit just to become a little strong, just to resist and fight. That's what has happened. Some day in your past you must have felt that your survival was at stake, mm? that's why. So just as a measure to protect you, your energy has coiled upon itself. But when it happens it is difficult to go deep in love, because it goes on protecting even then, so it simply.… Now there is no need.…\nThe first group I have given you is trust, mm? Just do... groups and be here totally available, open, vulnerable and absorb as much energy as you can from me.\nIt will dissolve. If it has not dissolved then tell me when you go. I will give you a\nmethod and it will be gone. It is nothing to be worried about. We are dissolving mountains -- it is just a small, tiny molehill!\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThe Open Secret Chapter #26\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2289","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_open_secret/part25/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_open_secret/>The Open Secret</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>11 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2289 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Open_Secret/part25.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part24>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

in Christianity, in fact the next after Jesus. He brings something new
to the world. Imbibe that spirit. He brings this spirit, that he is
deeply in love with nature, to the world. Christianity has been against

another part from another thing. It is a new shape, it is a new
mechanism: it comes as sadism.</p><p>You will have to unveil your unconscious. You will have to go there
and you will have to face the naked truth. So don't judge and don't
condemn: allow your unconscious total freedom to say what it wants to.
If the idea comes that you wanted to make love to your mother, don't
say, 'No ! That is stupid -- I never wanted 1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on

otherwise you will be judgemental and again you will throw it back. It
is perfectly okay. Every child has thought that, felt that. They may not
be alert about it but it has been there.</p><p>Sadism is not a single disease. It is many diseases together and
that's why it cannot be tackled directly...</p><p>because it has such complexity. You cannot tackle it from one aspect;
all the aspects have to be understood.</p><p>It has to be analysed in its separate aspects, watched, observed, and
in that very observation you will find the complex is disappearing. That
day you will become for the first time mature, that day you will become
for the first time free of your parents. That day you are no more your
'mother's good boy'; that day you are on your own. That is the second
birth.</p><p>So just allow it. Actually going into it is not going to help; it may
create more problems. But next time you come, if it is difficult for you
to allow it, we can make some arrangements, mm? It has to be dissolved,
but first you try on your own: just allow it, just go into it very
lovingly, with no judgement. And by and by the unconscious will start
whispering, first in very very small whispers because it is afraid of
you, mm? --</p><p>you have been so much against it.</p><p>Once it becomes courageous and knows you are not rejecting any more
it will gain courage, voice. It will become strong, it will start
talking more clearly, it will become more articulate. And it has great
mysteries to reveal to you: it has all the keys of your transformation.
Once the basement is vacated completely, once the basement is no more
full of all repressed things, once they have all evaporated from there,
great freedom and great purity comes -- the purity of emptiness. A very
austere beauty arises inside.</p><p>During these six months, whenever you have time just sit silently and
allow the</p><p>unconscious. Go with it totally, let it have its say, persuade it to
say whatsoever it wants to say. Tell it constantly that there is no need
to hide, no need to wear masks, no need to come in different forms. It
can come directly; there is no condemnation on your part. Say it again
and again. By and by the unconscious will gather courage, will come
closer.</p><p>It is almost like a bird; it is so afraid that it remains away. If
you allow it a little bit it comes closer; if you give it food then it
starts coming closer but watches you. Who knows? this food may be a
trick: you may be just trying to trap or kill. But by and by the bird
starts learning that you are not an enemy, you are a friend; it comes
closer. One day suddenly it is hopping on your shoulder. That's how the
unconscious has to be persuaded by and by. You do this, and if it has
not happened, then when you come back. Good.</p><p>[A sannyasin says there is a little girl in her who doesn't want to
grow up -- perhaps because her parents split up when she was ten. Also
she is very clinging in relationship. Osho checks her energy.]</p><p>Nothing to be worried about; it is not much of a problem. Just a
small energy block is there. It is not very complicated, it can simply
dissolve. These groups will do much; and then remind me about how you
are feeling when you go. If something is needed then I will give you a
technique so you can work; it will simply be gone.</p><p>It is there: just a small lump, just some energy has become hard
there. It must have happened as a survival measure.</p><p>When one feels that survival is at stake the heart becomes a little
hard, otherwise you cannot protect yourself. You cannot remain
vulnerable: you close a little bit just to become a little strong, just
to resist and fight. That's what has happened. Some day in your past you
must have felt that your survival was at stake, mm? that's why. So just
as a measure to protect you, your energy has coiled upon itself. But
when it happens it is difficult to go deep in love, because it goes on
protecting even then, so it simply.… Now there is no need.…</p><p>The first group I have given you is trust, mm? Just do... groups and
be here totally available, open, vulnerable and absorb as much energy as
you can from me.</p><p>It will dissolve. If it has not dissolved then tell me when you go. I
will give you a</p><p>method and it will be gone. It is nothing to be worried about. We are
dissolving mountains -- it is just a small, tiny molehill!</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on

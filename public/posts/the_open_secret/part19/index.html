Let me see how far away you are!\nIt is strange but it is beautiful. It is not a confused state at all; it is very clear. You are feeling confusion because it is beyond your expectations. It is incomprehensible to you, that's why you are feeling confused.\nYou cannot figure it out because you don't have any past experience of this space. But it is not confusion: it is something new.\nWhenever something new happens it takes time to settle with you and you take time to settle with it. It is just a settling confusion. But it is not at all harmful or negative; it is very positive and very creative. You are feeling far away from here and far away from there because for the first time you are falling into your being\n. . . which is far away from everywhere. For the first time you are attaining to a kind of centering, for the first time you are becoming a soul. These are the first glimpses of it.\nDon't call it confusion, because to label it confusion is to name it wrongly. And whenever you name something wrongly you start reacting to it according to your labelling. If you call it confusion then it is something bad, something which has to be got rid of. If you call it creative chaos then there is no need to be worried about it. One has to go into it! One has to be happy about it: it is creative chaos, it is not confusion.\nAnd language sometimes can create trouble. One has to be really very particular about using words when one starts moving inwards. Just a small word can do much harm. Call it confusion and then it is ill, then you are not in a state of well- being. Something is wrong and the wrong has to be put right.\nYou have made a problem just by giving this experience a name. If you don't know what it is, it is better to keep quiet about it. Don't use any words; it is better to be silent about it. Let it reveal itself to you, because whatsoever you name it will be wrong. It will come from the past. And you don't know what it is.\nYou are ignorant about it, hence you are feeling confused. Your knowledge is of no use for this space, your knowledge is absolutely inadequate. It has no way to say anything about this space, hence your knowledgeable mind is feeling confused and you are mistaking it for your confusion. You are not your mind, you are not your knowledge, you are not your past. You are far bigger than that. They are only small fragments in your being; don't think that they are your whole being.\nSo my suggestion is: firstly, call it creative chaos, call it a state of transformation. It is as if you change your house, mm? -- you go from one house to another house. Everything goes topsy-turvy. You are just on the truck in the middle of moving. Everything packed and you are sitting on your suitcases. The new house has not arrived yet, the old has been left; you are on the road. Naturally, you will be in a confusion. If you need something you cannot find it. Even when you have arrived at the new house for a few days you will need to settle with the house, with its vibe, with its space.\nPsychologists say that it takes at least three days for a person to fall deeply into sleep in a new place and twenty-one days to be really part of that space. This must have been known to Buddha somehow, because he has said that his monks should not stay more than three days in one house, because after three days you 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nstart feeling it is your house. He said they should leave before that idea, that it was theirs, arose. They should not live in one town more than twenty-one days because then they would start feeling that they are part of the town. A monk should be a wanderer: he should not belong anywhere and nothing should belong to him.\nBuddha must have somehow come across this line -- three days, twenty-one days. Modern psychology has done much research into how the mind functions in a new place.\nSo it will take a few days; it depends on you how many. If you accept it totally then soon it will be settled. If you reject it will take a little longer time; if you go on fighting with it then still longer. It can take months and years. Accept it whole-heartedly. And whether you are here or there will not make any difference: accept it. It is a great guest that has knocked on your door. It is the guest for which you have been waiting for many lives. Now be a host, now receive this guest! Something really beautiful is there.\n[A sannyasin, newly arrived, says she works as a psychologist in a prison ]\nThat's very good! Introduce meditations and many things there.…\nBecause criminals can be helped immensely; you have just to make a few approaches. You can start with a small group: first with the staff if they feel, then with a few prisoners. It can be of immense help because prisoners really need some catharsis. They have become criminals because life and society did not allow them catharsis.\nIf you have violence and there is no outlet for it, one day or other it will explode and you will be possessed by it. You will do something for which you will suffer unnecessarily. And the violence can be released very easily with Dynamic Meditation... very easily. A person can become absolutely peaceful and non- violent.\nIf the world moves towards meditation a little more almost ninety percent of crimes will simply evaporate. Only ten percent of crimes will not evaporate through meditation because those are the crimes which are done in cold blood.\nThose are the crimes which are more political than psychological; psychological crimes can disappear very easily.\nMuch can be done; start a little bit. It can become a great pioneering work. Prem means love, and samya means equanimity, equilibrium, balance.\n'Sam' is one of the most important roots in Sanskrit; samadhi comes from 'sam'. It means ultimate equilibrium, where all the problems have disappeared. Samya is the first step towards samadhi. One starts balancing oneself, just as the tightrope walker balances himself -- sometimes leaning to the left and sometimes leaning to the right, continuously leaning this way and that way. Whenever he feels that some imbalance is coming he immediately puts it right. And that's how he walks just in the middle, although when you watch him you continuously see him leaning to the left, leaning to the right. He goes on leaning with the help of a stick, a staff, but his whole effort is to keep in the middle, just to be in the middle.\nSamya means just to be in the middle. Even if sometimes you have to lean, you have to keep in mind that the leaning is in service of being in the middle. One should avoid extremes because all extremes create neurosis. It is only in the middle that one is whole and healthy... and that applies to everything. It is very easy for the mind to go from one extreme to the other; the mind is an extremist. It is easy for the mind to eat too much and it is easy for the mind to go on a fast. The difficult thing is to remain in the middle and to eat only that much which is necessary, neither less or more. That is a difficult thing for the mind, and to do that difficult thing helps you to go beyond mind... in everything.\nAvoid the extreme, that is my message for you, and you will be immensely benefited. At every step you will be surprised at how much joy is possible if you can keep in the middle.\n[The tantra group was present and the leader said that some personal experiences of catharsis, and of regression to the womb happened to her. She was not sure whether to go into them in front of the group when she was the leader. She did go into it and the group energy was very strong after.]\nIf something like this happens sometimes you have to go into it. If you repress it you will not be flowing with your energy, and if you are not flowing with your energy you cannot flow with the group and the group cannot flow with you.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nSo even if sometimes it is silly and stupid there is no way to avoid it; you have to go into it, rather than pretending.… Because that will be a pretension -- that you are the leader so how can you go into some silly thing? But the whole purpose here is to drop the distinction between silliness and wisdom.\nA really wise man is one who can sometimes, when needed, be silly. A wise man who can never be silly is absolutely stupid because he will not have contradictions and the meeting of contradictions in him. He will not have any flavour. The flavour comes only when contradictions meet in you, when polarities come and meet in you.\nSo a wise man who is just wise and nothing else is not very wise. A really wise man allows foolishness also to have its say; he is unafraid of foolishness. He can absorb foolishness too, he can use foolishness too.\nThat wise man has a richer being.\nSo don't be worried: if sometimes you feel something is happening just sit in the middle of the group and tell everybody that this is happening and you are going into it and ask that they all please bless you!\nLet them bless you and go into it. They will be closer to you after that because they will see that you are not super-human, that you are not some holier-than- thou, mm? -- that you are as stupid as everybody else.\nSo next time it happens you just go into it and let everybody surround you and let them bless you, and after that they will be really flowing with you. It is good; nothing to be worried about.\nThe Open Secret Chapter #20\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"1843","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_open_secret/part19/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_open_secret/>The Open Secret</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>9 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1843 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Open_Secret/part19.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part18>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

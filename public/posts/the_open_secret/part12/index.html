And all that is true, good, beautiful, is beyond the mind. He valiantly continues ]\nThe mind is only utilitarian. It is useful in the world but its reach is very limited. And all that can become a contentment is beyond its reach. The mind is the faculty of thinking, the process of thought. But when you are full of thought, too occupied with thought, you don't have the space, the receptivity, that is needed to absorb God or beauty or benediction.\nWhen you are empty, only then does something become possible. With the world the mind is perfectly adequate; beyond the world the mind is the hindrance.\nSo use it in the world, I am not against its use, but don't be obsessed by it. One should be capable of putting the mind aside. That is what meditation is all about. It is not against the mind; it is simply the capacity to put the mind aside whenever it is not needed.\nIf you are talking to someone the mind is needed, otherwise language will not be possible. But when you are sitting alone it is not needed; it is mad to use it then. It is as if a man is sitting and continuously moving his legs. This is madness. Because when you are walking the movement of the legs is absolutely needed but when you are sitting this movement of the legs simply shows that you are insane. But that is happening in the mind continuously: when you are not talking\nyou are talking inside. When thought is not needed you are continuously thinking. Even while asleep one goes on dreaming.\nThe English word 'mind' comes from the Sanskrit root 'manu'; and the English word 'man' also comes from the same root, 'manu'. Man has become completely identified with the mind, hence man and mind both come from the same root. That is not true and that is not right either. Man is far more than the mind; the mind is only one of the faculties of man. Man is an immensity. The mind is only a window into the sky; it is 1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nnot the sky itself. The sky is far greater, but one has to come away from the window to see the sky. So come away from the window and see the sky !\n[A sannyasin who is leaving says he will have to go to gaol for half a year.]\nUse the opportunity. Because now the whole world is so crowded that the best place to meditate is gaol.\nYou cannot find a better place!\n[The sannyasin says: I've been to gaol before.]\nMm, that's very good; so you are experienced too! Use that opportunity for meditation. Don't be in a hurry to get out soon. Rather than working, meditate. And sometimes curses can become blessings; it all depends on how we take a thing, how we interpret it. Rather than thinking that you are being gaoled, think that you are gaoling the whole world outside. Nobody will be disturbing you and there will be no worry: no question of employment, no question of work, no question of money.\nSo I would like to tell you three things: One, be utterly obedient; then your meditation will not be disturbed at all. Follow the rules to the letter. Make it a point as if it is a discipline for you. So for six months let it be a discipline. And not as if it is forced on you: once you make it a discipline it is you who are\nwilling it. So it is not somebody else imposing it on you, because when you think somebody is imposing it on you there is natural rebellion. But when you think that you are accepting it for your own sake then there is a totally different quality to it.\nAnd for six months be utterly in tune with the world that you will be part of in there. Become part of it, as if this is your life -- with no resistance, with no reluctance, with no complaints, with no grudge; on the contrary, with gratitude that God has given you an opportunity to meditate for these six months.\nMeditate, pray and use all the time in becoming more and more silent. These six months will prove the best time in your life and you will never be the same again.\nSo go happily; nothing to worry about. Keep the box with you. And I will be there. Whenever you need me just put it on your heart and remember me. As soon as you are free, come back, mm? This is some work that I am giving you: these six months have to become absolutely meditative, so don't do anything that becomes a distraction; don't do anything that creates any tension in you.\nJust relax... and things will go really as they should. You will come out luminous!\n[A seeker has fallen in love with Osho but hesitates to take sannyas before he has resolved some private matters which he does not want to talk to Osho about in public.]\nThere is no public... there is no public. In fact bringing things out will make the resolving easier. The privacy may be one of the things that may not allow it to resolve itself. Many things go on continuing because we go on keeping them secret. They have to be exposed. Exposure is always good and healthy; and many things simply disappear by exposure -- just the fresh air and the light. And once they are exposed you stop clinging to them; there is no point.\nThis is one of the insights of psychoanalysis, that if a person goes on keeping things in himself it is very difficult to get rid of them. If he exposes them to the psychoanalyst it becomes easier. But the psychoanalyst is a single person. Group therapy goes one step ahead: one has to expose oneself in a group. Then things are-resolved far more easily, far deeper and far sooner. That's going to help. Just bring it out.\n[The seeker says: I was born a Hassidic rabbi... and I have a strong sense of betrayal.]\nNot at all... because I am a Hassid!\nNo, nothing. If you miss me you will miss Hassidism for your whole life. You will not find any Hassid if you cannot understand me.\n... That feeling is just a defence mechanism. In fact, if you are really a Hassid there is no way to betray it. One cannot betray it. Let this become one of the most precious understandings in you: if you know something, if you love something, there is no way to betray it. If you love me you can go against me and you will not be betraying; your love will protect you. Even going against me will not be a betrayal. And if going against becomes a betrayal then even if you are with me the betrayal is there.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThe fear simply shows that you have not understood the point.… [The seeker says: I don't agree that Jesus was the greatest Jew.]\nThere is no need to agree... there is no need to agree. This is not the point at all. You need not agree with what I say; you can only agree with me directly. There is no need to come through what I say. I say a thousand and one things and I contradict myself every day. If you start agreeing with me you will go mad!\nYou can't agree; nobody can agree with what I say. You can only agree with a few points but those will not be all that I say. Contradiction is my method. I go on shattering. I go on shocking, I go on offending people; that's my method. You need not agree - with what I say and still you can agree with me... and that is a totally different thing.\nSannyas is not agreeing with my statements. Sannyas is agreeing with my being,\nwith my love... with me! It is direct -- as if you have never heard what I have said and you have never read what I have said, and-yoU look at me and you agree with me. It is an agreement between two beings! t is not a philosophical agreement; it is existential.\n[The seeker says: I have never felt the kind of love I feel for you!]\nI know it ! And that's why I am insisting that if you miss me you will be betraying -- betraying Hassidism!\n... So that something has to be resolved. And the closer you come, the more you will understand what Hassidism is. Because these things are not dogmatic. Hassidism has nothing to do with Judaism, Hassidism has nothing to do with any theology. These are the purest approaches towards being.\nHassidism is the very heart of all the religions. You can call it Sufism, it is the same; you can call it Zen, it is the same. These are just different languages saying the same thing.…\n[The seeker says: Give me your blessings and I'll come back.]\nNo, my blessings are with you... but you will be in a great turmoil if you go without taking sannyas. You will be in much misery. If you want to choose that it is perfectly okay; but you will be in a misery and you will carry a problem inside. It is not good to carry a problem because all problems dissipate energy. And you are carrying a problem for the wrong reasons. If it were for right reasons I would never say to become a sannyasin. If I had felt, even for a single moment, that this would be a kind of betrayal for you then I would be the last man Because I would not help anybody betray anything.\n[The seeker says: I feel I'm a sannyasin but I'm just not ready for the uniform.]\nThese are just defences, because when one is ready for sannyas then one is ready for everything --\nwhatsoever comes with it: the whole madness! These are our logical ways of protecting, and you have protected yourself long enough. The time is ripe ! I can wait, I am not in a hurry but you will be in a constant turmoil. If you choose it, that's okay.…\nCome here! This (a handkerchief of Osho's) is for you. Keep this with you... and come back! Good.\n[A sannyasin who has done the Vipassana group was working in the kitchen. He wonders if it will be disturbing to go back to the kitchen. Osho says it will be helpful to both continue an hour's Vipassana meditation each day and work in the kitchen. The two will provide a balance. And through the kitchen many have become enlightened!]\n[A sannyasin says he has a block in his hara from the fear that he is holding on to. He feels it when he has been fasting. Osho checks his energy.]\nThere is a block and there is a story behind the block. And once you understand the whole thing of what is behind it it will start melting and disappear. It happens only to people who have committed hara-kiri, who have committed suicide through the hara in some past life. Otherwise this type of block ordinarily never happens.\n1/08/07\nCopyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\nThis happens only if the knife has gone into the hara centre. Then only does this kind of complex arise; this is just a protection. This time you cannot commit hara-kiri: this is just a natural protection. In the past life somewhere you committed hara-kiri.…\nHara-kiri is a special kind of suicide; it is not an ordinary suicide. People can only do it in Japan, nowhere else, because it needs a certain training to do it. First you have to be perfectly aware of where the hara is. In fact, except for the Japanese, people are not aware of it because no other people have worked to find it.\nIt is out of the hara that life arises. The child is joined with the mother at the navel and the hara is just below the navel, two inches below. Through the navel the child is nourished by the mother. All the nursing energy goes into the hara\nand through the hara it spreads all over the body. So if the knife can cut the hara directly, you will die immediately because the main root will be cut.\nThere will be no bloodshed and there will be no pain. Before your head comes to know of it you will be dead. There will be no pain: the cutting of the hara creates a painless suicide. If you commit suicide in any other way you will have to suffer pain. To cut the hara means to cut the main root through which you are joined with God or with universal energy. Suddenly it is broken: you are thrown apart.\nOnce it happens, once a person has committed hara-kiri, then in the next life this block arises. This block is just a natural protection so that you cannot commit hara-kiri. Now this time you cannot commit hara-kiri; this time there is no way. In Japan they use it to feel whether a man has committed hara-kiri some time in the past.\nSo it has nothing to do with this life, one thing; but it does have something to do with your past life and in that way it can be used in a very positive way. To commit hara-kiri needs a certain training of the mind, the body, a certain understanding of Zen. That understanding is there from your past. You can use it and you can help it grow; you can go into Zen very easily.\nBut don't be worried about it. There is no need to dissolve it because it is not blocking anything; it is simply a protection, that's all. But you can feel it -- when you fast you can feel it.\nNot at all! Don't be worried about it at all. It has nothing to do with your digestion, with your body or anything. You can completely forget about it but it can be used. It is indicative that in your past life you have worked in a certain training, the Zen training. So study more about Zen. Vipassana will be good, Zazen will be good. Any methods concerned with Zen will be very good, because once you do those methods suddenly your past life will start joining with them; there will be a great explosion.\n[The sannyasin says: I had a good time with Vipassana.] It will be very helpful.\nContinue -- Vipassana, Zazen, or anything like that. Anything silent, awareness, will help. And this is nothing to do with your body. You can forget about it and\nyou need not try to dissolve it. If you can go deep in meditation, particularly Vipassana, it will by and by dissolve. But you need not work to dissolve it because it has nothing to do with you. Meditation will help and it will go; but it will go only when your life energy has become perfectly certain that now you cannot commit suicide; otherwise it will not go.\nAnd that understanding, that assurance, can come only through deep Vipassana. Then who bothers to commit suicide? In Vipassana you become so non-attached to life, even life becomes so far away, so who bothers to commit suicide? Suicide indicates a great attachment to life. People who commit suicide are very much attached to life.\nHara-kiri is committed because of honour, too much attachment to life and honour. For example, you are defeated in a duel or in some fight and it is against your honour, against your ego: you commit hara-kiri. But this is deep attachment to life. When your attachment to life disappears this block will automatically dissolve. And because it is not hindering anything you need not worry about it. But it is there.…\nThe Open Secret Chapter #13 1/08/07 Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994\nOsho's books on CD-ROM, published and unpublished Query:-\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2777","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_open_secret/part12/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_open_secret/>The Open Secret</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: None</h1><div class=post-meta>14 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;2777 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Open_Secret/part12.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part11>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

anything that creates any tension in you.</p><p>Just relax... and things will go really as they should. You will come
out luminous!</p><p>[A seeker has fallen in love with Osho but hesitates to take sannyas
before he has resolved some private matters which he does not want to
talk to Osho about in public.]</p><p>There is no public... there is no public. In fact bringing things out
will make the resolving easier. The privacy may be one of the things
that may not allow it to resolve itself. Many things go on continuing
because we go on keeping them secret. They have to be exposed. Exposure
is always good and healthy; and many things simply disappear by exposure
-- just the fresh air and the light. And once they are exposed you stop
clinging to them; there is no point.</p><p>This is one of the insights of psychoanalysis, that if a person goes
on keeping things in himself it is very difficult to get rid of them. If
he exposes them to the psychoanalyst it becomes easier. But the
psychoanalyst is a single person. Group therapy goes one step ahead: one
has to expose oneself in a group. Then things are-resolved far more
easily, far deeper and far sooner. That's going to help. Just bring it
out.</p><p>[The seeker says: I was born a Hassidic rabbi... and I have a strong
sense of betrayal.]</p><p>Not at all... because I am a Hassid!</p><p>No, nothing. If you miss me you will miss Hassidism for your whole
life. You will not find any Hassid if you cannot understand me.</p><p>... That feeling is just a defence mechanism. In fact, if you are
really a Hassid there is no way to betray it. One cannot betray it. Let
this become one of the most precious understandings in you: if you know
something, if you love something, there is no way to betray it. If you
love me you can go against me and you will not be betraying; your love
will protect you. Even going against me will not be a betrayal. And if
going against becomes a betrayal then even if you are with me the
betrayal is there.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-1>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>The fear simply shows that you have not understood the point.… [The
seeker says: I don't agree that Jesus was the greatest Jew.]</p><p>There is no need to agree... there is no need to agree. This is not
the point at all. You need not agree with what I say; you can only agree
with me directly. There is no need to come through what I say. I say a
thousand and one things and I contradict myself every day. If you start
agreeing with me you will go mad!</p><p>You can't agree; nobody can agree with what I say. You can only agree
with a few points but those will not be all that I say. Contradiction is
my method. I go on shattering. I go on shocking, I go on offending
people; that's my method. You need not agree - with what I say and still
you can agree with me... and that is a totally different thing.</p><p>Sannyas is not agreeing with my statements. Sannyas is agreeing with
my being,</p><p>with my love... with me! It is direct -- as if you have never heard
what I have said and you have never read what I have said, and-yoU look
at me and you agree with me. It is an agreement between two beings! t is
not a philosophical agreement; it is existential.</p><p>[The seeker says: I have never felt the kind of love I feel for
you!]</p><p>I know it ! And that's why I am insisting that if you miss me you
will be betraying -- betraying Hassidism!</p><p>... So that something has to be resolved. And the closer you come,
the more you will understand what Hassidism is. Because these things are
not dogmatic. Hassidism has nothing to do with Judaism, Hassidism has
nothing to do with any theology. These are the purest approaches towards
being.</p><p>Hassidism is the very heart of all the religions. You can call it
Sufism, it is the same; you can call it Zen, it is the same. These are
just different languages saying the same thing.…</p><p>[The seeker says: Give me your blessings and I'll come back.]</p><p>No, my blessings are with you... but you will be in a great turmoil
if you go without taking sannyas. You will be in much misery. If you
want to choose that it is perfectly okay; but you will be in a misery
and you will carry a problem inside. It is not good to carry a problem
because all problems dissipate energy. And you are carrying a problem
for the wrong reasons. If it were for right reasons I would never say to
become a sannyasin. If I had felt, even for a single moment, that this
would be a kind of betrayal for you then I would be the last man Because
I would not help anybody betray anything.</p><p>[The seeker says: I feel I'm a sannyasin but I'm just not ready for
the uniform.]</p><p>These are just defences, because when one is ready for sannyas then
one is ready for everything --</p><p>whatsoever comes with it: the whole madness! These are our logical
ways of protecting, and you have protected yourself long enough. The
time is ripe ! I can wait, I am not in a hurry but you will be in a
constant turmoil. If you choose it, that's okay.…</p><p>Come here! This (a handkerchief of Osho's) is for you. Keep this with
you... and come back! Good.</p><p>[A sannyasin who has done the Vipassana group was working in the
kitchen. He wonders if it will be disturbing to go back to the kitchen.
Osho says it will be helpful to both continue an hour's Vipassana
meditation each day and work in the kitchen. The two will provide a
balance. And through the kitchen many have become enlightened!]</p><p>[A sannyasin says he has a block in his hara from the fear that he is
holding on to. He feels it when he has been fasting. Osho checks his
energy.]</p><p>There is a block and there is a story behind the block. And once you
understand the whole thing of what is behind it it will start melting
and disappear. It happens only to people who have committed hara-kiri,
who have committed suicide through the hara in some past life. Otherwise
this type of block ordinarily never happens.</p><p>1/08/07</p><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-2>Osho's books on
CD-ROM, published and unpublished</h3><p>Query:-</p><p>This happens only if the knife has gone into the hara centre. Then
only does this kind of complex arise; this is just a protection. This
time you cannot commit hara-kiri: this is just a natural protection. In
the past life somewhere you committed hara-kiri.…</p><p>Hara-kiri is a special kind of suicide; it is not an ordinary
suicide. People can only do it in Japan, nowhere else, because it needs
a certain training to do it. First you have to be perfectly aware of
where the hara is. In fact, except for the Japanese, people are not
aware of it because no other people have worked to find it.</p><p>It is out of the hara that life arises. The child is joined with the
mother at the navel and the hara is just below the navel, two inches
below. Through the navel the child is nourished by the mother. All the
nursing energy goes into the hara</p><p>and through the hara it spreads all over the body. So if the knife
can cut the hara directly, you will die immediately because the main
root will be cut.</p><p>There will be no bloodshed and there will be no pain. Before your
head comes to know of it you will be dead. There will be no pain: the
cutting of the hara creates a painless suicide. If you commit suicide in
any other way you will have to suffer pain. To cut the hara means to cut
the main root through which you are joined with God or with universal
energy. Suddenly it is broken: you are thrown apart.</p><p>Once it happens, once a person has committed hara-kiri, then in the
next life this block arises. This block is just a natural protection so
that you cannot commit hara-kiri. Now this time you cannot commit
hara-kiri; this time there is no way. In Japan they use it to feel
whether a man has committed hara-kiri some time in the past.</p><p>So it has nothing to do with this life, one thing; but it does have
something to do with your past life and in that way it can be used in a
very positive way. To commit hara-kiri needs a certain training of the
mind, the body, a certain understanding of Zen. That understanding is
there from your past. You can use it and you can help it grow; you can
go into Zen very easily.</p><p>But don't be worried about it. There is no need to dissolve it
because it is not blocking anything; it is simply a protection, that's
all. But you can feel it -- when you fast you can feel it.</p><p>Not at all! Don't be worried about it at all. It has nothing to do
with your digestion, with your body or anything. You can completely
forget about it but it can be used. It is indicative that in your past
life you have worked in a certain training, the Zen training. So study
more about Zen. Vipassana will be good, Zazen will be good. Any methods
concerned with Zen will be very good, because once you do those methods
suddenly your past life will start joining with them; there will be a
great explosion.</p><p>[The sannyasin says: I had a good time with Vipassana.] It will be
very helpful.</p><p>Continue -- Vipassana, Zazen, or anything like that. Anything silent,
awareness, will help. And this is nothing to do with your body. You can
forget about it and</p><p>you need not try to dissolve it. If you can go deep in meditation,
particularly Vipassana, it will by and by dissolve. But you need not
work to dissolve it because it has nothing to do with you. Meditation
will help and it will go; but it will go only when your life energy has
become perfectly certain that now you cannot commit suicide; otherwise
it will not go.</p><p>And that understanding, that assurance, can come only through deep
Vipassana. Then who bothers to commit suicide? In Vipassana you become
so non-attached to life, even life becomes so far away, so who bothers
to commit suicide? Suicide indicates a great attachment to life. People
who commit suicide are very much attached to life.</p><p>Hara-kiri is committed because of honour, too much attachment to life
and honour. For example, you are defeated in a duel or in some fight and
it is against your honour, against your ego: you commit hara-kiri. But
this is deep attachment to life. When your attachment to life disappears
this block will automatically dissolve. And because it is not hindering
anything you need not worry about it. But it is there.…</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;line-height:192%;text-align:left id=the-open-secret-chapter-13-10807>The Open Secret <span class=p>Chapter #13 1/08/07</span></h3><p>Copyright Osho International Foundation 1994</p><h3 style=padding-top:14pt;padding-left:5pt;text-indent:0;text-align:left id=oshos-books-on-cd-rom-published-and-unpublished-3>Osho's books on

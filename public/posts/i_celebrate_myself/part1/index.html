THEY ARE ALL LIKE THE MOON REFLECTED IN WATER, OR\nIMAGES IN THE MIRROR. HOW CAN WE SPEAK OF THEM AS BEING BORN\nOR AS PASSING AWAY?\n\"WHEN YOU COME TO THIS UNDERSTANDING, YOU WILL BE FURNISHED\nWITH ALL THE THINGS YOU ARE IN NEED OF.\"\nFriends,\nGood evening. And good news ...!\nThis evening we are starting a new series of talks: I CELEBRATE MYSELF. GOD IS\nNO WHERE: LIFE IS NOW HERE.\nThe statement of Friedrich Nietzsche that God is dead, is only symbolic because God has never been in the first place -- not even born. How can he be dead? But it was a tremendously powerful symbol to declare that God is dead.\nIt was a recognition that we have been worshipping a lie. And it was not only worshipping, we were being destroyed by a lie. We had been exploited by the priesthood of all the organized religions. Our dignity has been destroyed. We have been turned into puppets in the hands of a fiction.\nHis declaration that God is dead simply means that Man is born. That is the other side of the coin. And because man is born, he brings freedom to the earth, he brings joy to the earth, he brings dignity to the earth. And he destroys all that was clinging to the ultimate lie, God -- all the superstitions, heaven and hell, all theologies, all religions ... all kinds of false programming of man's being. They have also died with God.\nHence, I celebrate myself and I celebrate you.\nFriedrich Nietzsche's statement also includes another part: \"God is dead, therefore man is free.\" God was the slavery of man, he was the bondage. He was the prison that did not allow humanity to rise to its ultimate heights. He was keeping the whole of humanity reduced to subhuman beings, sinners. His death is a great moment to celebrate.\nHis death means man has come of age. He is no longer a child and he does not need a father figure. He can stand on his own feet. He is not a sheep, as all the religions have been telling him, and he does not need any shepherds. Jesus, Krishna, Mahavira, Mohammed, Moses ... no prophets are needed, no saviors are needed, no messengers of God are needed. They were all megalomaniacs, and in\nthe name of God they have been pushing human consciousness to the lowest levels of existence.\nThe death of God cleans the whole sky outside and cleans the inner world also, completely -- cleans you of all the belief systems, cleans you of all prejudices, cleans you of all guilt. That is what he meant by freedom. Freedom from guilt was possible only if God was dead. And once you are free from God you have the whole sky to yourself, inner and outer both -- you can open your wings in utter freedom. Without any inhibition, and without any suppression, you can live your life with joy, with song, with dance.\nGod not being there is a great event, the greatest event that has happened in the whole history of mankind. The absence of God gives you a certain solid presence. For the first time you are individuals, independent souls -- not creatures who have been created, but individual consciousnesses which have been in existence from eternity to eternity.\nThis is a glorious moment for those who can understand all the implications of God's death. They will immediately celebrate it, because it gives you a new sense of direction, a new uniqueness, a new destiny. It makes you a master of your own destiny. Nobody is there to guide you, and nobody is there to dominate you, and nobody is there to give commandments to you.\nFor the first time, in Nietzsche's statement, man comes of age. But very few people have heard that God is dead and they are still worshipping him. They are still praying in the churches, in the temples, in the mosques. They are still holding the lie as if it is the truth.\nAnd because of that lie their whole life becomes phony. They cannot laugh, they cannot enjoy. Their only duty, propounded by all the religions, is to be masochists -- torture yourself as much as you can. The more you torture yourself, the greater saint you are.\nAll the religions have been preaching nothing but masochism. That gives me a deep insight into God.\nMankind has to be masochist, guilty -- torturing himself, torturing and destroying his own roots in nature, going against nature ... suffering all kinds of stupidities because God was a sadist. All the religions, unknowingly, are propounding a God that is a sadist. He loves humanity to suffer. He loves people\nto torture themselves. He does not like your laughter, he does not like your joy. He does not like your pleasure, your blissfulness, your cheerfulness. He does not like your songs, and he does not like your dances and your celebrations. He has taken away all that was beautiful on this earth. He hates the earth!\nHe is against the earth. He is against life itself.\nSo what, in the name of God, your saints have been doing all these thousands of years is nothing but committing a gradual suicide. The more dead you are, the more you will find followers. The more alive you are, the religions will condemn you, the masses will condemn you, all the idiots of the world will be together to destroy you.\nJoy is not acceptable. Laughter is not acceptable. A sense of humor is not part of any religion. Life has become sad, misery, anguish, anxiety. Who is responsible for all this?\nThe first responsibility is a fictitious God who is represented by the priesthood around the world. Millions of people in this priesthood are living on your blood. They are parasites not priests. And their whole function is to keep you miserable, because only a miserable person can bow down to a fictitious God. And they have been respecting those -- giving them prestige and honor -- who were nothing but insane people.\nAnybody who goes against life is insane. Life is all that we have.\nIf you go against it, you are committing suicide. Maybe it is very slow suicide -- it may take a few years for you to die. One religion, Jainism -- unfortunately I have been born into that religion -- even supports the idea of suicide. Other religions unconsciously support it, but Jainism is clear about it.\nIt preaches that if you want to commit suicide, commit it because this life is not worth living. This earth is not your home, your home is beyond the clouds. They call it santhara, but it actually means slow suicide. Whenever a man goes on santhara, he becomes immediately a great saint. Santhara is a fast unto death -- no food, and in the end no water. For a healthy man to die it takes almost ninety days, and those ninety days are of immense self-torture. Jainism is simply making conscious that which every religion has as an implication.\nWhat have all the saints of the world been doing? And what is saintly in their actions, in their behavior, in their style of life?\nA man who was worshipped very much by the Christians in Egypt, remained sitting on a high pole for twelve years! It was a ruin of an old palace, and only one pillar was standing high. It was very difficult; it was a small place to remain on for twelve years. He could not sleep -- he had to tie himself to the pillar. He could not come down even to go to the toilet, so he was defecating from the pillar, pissing from the pillar ... and people were worshipping him ...!\nHe must have suffered immensely just to get this honor, honor from the ignorant masses.\nJust to get this prestige of being a great saint, he was living in utter dirtiness, ugliness.\nAnd he dropped from the pillar only when he died. A great memorial exists in his name because he has done the greatest penance against the original sin of Adam and Eve.\nStrange ways have been found how to take your pride. Now Adam and Eve have committed a sin? I don't think they have committed any sin. They were simply provoked by God to eat from the Tree of Knowledge and from the Tree of Eternal Life. To prohibit anything is to provoke -- it is a simple psychology. God could have learned much from Sigmund Freud.\nIn the Garden of Eden where God lived, there were millions of trees. If he had not prohibited those two trees, I don't think that even by now we would have found them ...\nmillions of trees with beautiful fruits. We would have still been chewing grass in the Garden of Eden just like the buffaloes. If anybody committed the sin it was God himself.\nAnd why did he prohibit his own children from eating from the Tree of Knowledge? No father would do it. Every father wants his children to be as wise as possible. And why should a father prevent his own children from eating the fruit which will make them eternal, immortal. Every father would love -- even ordinary fathers on the earth would love their children to be immortals.\nWhat kind of God was this? And if this is God -- who prevents his children from becoming wise, from becoming Socrates, and Gautam Buddha, and Lao Tzu, this is not a god worth having. If he has not died by himself, then somebody has to murder him. He has tortured humanity enough.\nAnd strange is the fact that it was the Devil who persuaded Eve to eat from the Tree of Knowledge. He showed her why God was preventing them. He does not want anybody to be equal to him -- and you call this God compassionate? And you call this God love? The Devil was far more loving, far more compassionate! In fact, he showed man the way of wisdom, the way of immortality.\nGod is preventing his own children because he does not want them to be wise, he does not want them to be immortal. If they are immortal and wise then they will be equal to God, and he is afraid of their equality -- a very jealous God. In fact, the Old Testament declares it through God himself. God says, \"I am a very jealous God.\" He certainly is. He was jealous of his own children. He is not even worthy to be called a father. If the Devil had not told Eve, \"You have to eat these fruits, only then will you know in your innermost being that you are also gods\n...\"\nAs the story is, it makes it clear that the Devil was more in favor of human individuality, respect, dignity. God was against man from the very beginning. The whole evolution that has happened in science ... `Science' in its very roots means knowledge. Anything that has evolved in the inner consciousness of man\n-- the awakened ones, the enlightened ones who have come to know that life is eternal, it is a festival, beginningless, endless -- would not have been possible without the Devil. The Devil was the first rebellion against a dictatorial God.\nAnd I have to tell you that the word `devil' is much more meaningful than the word\n`God'. `God' simply means nothing, but `devil' comes from the Sanskrit root div. From div are derived `devil' and `day' in English; in Hindustani from dev, devata, which means divine; from div, divas, which mean daybreak, the beginning of the day, the end of the night. The Devil seems to be more divine than God. God seems to be really a very mean fellow, and it is good that he is dead otherwise somebody would have to shoot him. It is good that he died by himself, and we had not to have his blood on our hands.\nBut once God is no longer there, your freedom becomes a tremendous responsibility. It should not fall down into licentiousness, it should rise into enlightenment. Freedom brings responsibility. And I want you to understand that responsibility does not mean duty, it means only the ability to respond. Ability to respond to what? To every situation, moment to moment you should be so aware that you can find original responses to every original situation. Nothing in existence ever repeats.\nThey say history repeats itself, because man is an idiot. But existence never repeats itself, because existence is intelligence, wisdom, eternity. History will also stop repeating once there are millions of buddhas around the world, millions of people who have the sense of being alert, aware, conscious, and who feel that they have a great responsibility moment to moment -- not according to any scripture but according to everyone's consciousness.\nFreedom brings many fruits, and many flowers, and many gifts to you. The death of God is not something to be sorry and sad for. It is something to rejoice, something to dance, something to celebrate. At last man is free from guilt, man is free from a constant judgmental eye from the sky.\nIt is strange that The Holy Bible says, \"Judge ye not,\" but God does only one thing, judge. And they have also determined a day called The Judgment Day. To man it is said,\n\"Judge ye not\" -- and God is continuously judging, and is going to judge finally at The Judgement Day. What kind of contradiction ...?\nJust today I have received a letter from a few Christians saying that the Bible says,\n\"Judge ye not.\" But I am not a Christian, and I don't have any obligation to follow the Bible. I am not a Hindu ... I am not a person who belongs to any religion, so I don't have any obligation to follow The Holy Bible or holy Koran, or holy Bhagavadgita. All holy scriptures as I have looked into them, are absolutely unholy.\nThese four or five Christians who have written a letter to me want me not to judge Christians or Catholics, because the Bible says, \"Judge ye not\" -- and they are judging me! And their Bible says, \"Judge ye not.\" I am not a Christian so I have no obligation to follow the Bible. They are Christians, they should not\njudge me. I am free to judge, and I am free to judge everybody because I don't have any prejudice against anybody. I don't belong to any organization, to any system of beliefs. A God who teaches people, \"Judge ye not,\" himself goes on judging -- and you don't see the contradiction?\nJesus says, \"God is love,\" but there seems to be no love flowing from the skies to humanity. In three thousand years we have fought five thousand wars. What kind of God is there who allows Genghis Khan to be born? Tamerlane to be born? Nadirshah to be born? These three generations of one family killed one hundred million people, and they were never defeated.\nWhat kind of God allows President Truman to drop atom bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki? What kind of God is allowing all the stupid politicians of the world to pile up nuclear weapons which will only prove to be a global death?\nBut as I told you, God is a sadist. He enjoys when you are suffering. He enjoys when you are in pain. He enjoys when you are poor. He enjoys when you are starving to death. His enjoyment is simply sick!\nThe word `sadism' comes from a French count, de Sade; he used to torture women. He was a super-rich man, a count, and had a vast territory under his control. So any beautiful woman would be dragged to his torture chamber. You all have love chambers; he had a torture chamber -- that was his love chamber. And as the woman entered she could not believe what was going to happen because all over the walls were hanging different kinds of instruments of torture. He also used to carry a box, a portable torture chamber --\nbecause who knows? He may find a woman in a hotel room and he may not have his instruments.\nAll those instruments ... First he would force the woman to be naked -- not in a loving way -- he would tear off her clothes, he would scratch her body, he would start beating her ... and he had all those instruments. You have heard only the word `screwing' -- he really used to use screws to make holes in the woman's body. Unless there was blood he did not get excited. When he saw the woman in utter torture, then he was in great sexual excitement, then he would make love.\nAnd perhaps something of de Sade exists in every masochist man. Unless there is a pillow fight, unless there is some conflict before going to bed, a man seems not to be excited. A woman who beats him, hits him, throws things at him,\nexcites him.\nThe only perfect couple possible in the world would be if one partner was a sadist, and the other partner was a masochist. `Masochist' also comes from another count who enjoyed torturing himself. His name was Masoch; hence the word `masochist'. Both were imprisoned for insanity, both were found guilty; one of torturing others, and one of torturing himself.\nGod must be a sadist on a far bigger scale than de Sade. He is omnipotent, omnipowerful, omnipresent -- everywhere. You cannot escape him; his eyes of judgment are following you day and night, twenty-four hours, wherever you are. He is threatening you that you will fall into hellfire for eternity.\nEven a man like Bertrand Russell refused to be a Christian for the simple reason\n-- he has given many other reasons, but the first reason was \"I cannot accept a God who is so unjust\" -- that in Christianity there is only one life.\nEven if you live a life of one hundred years, as Bertrand Russell almost managed to live, one century ... He counted very honestly the sins that Christians call sins\n-- they are not sins, they are just natural experiences. They have been converted into sins to torture you.\nMaking love to a woman is not sin, but it has become a sin. Both are feeling immensely guilty that they are doing something against God.\nSo he counted all those so-called sins which are not sins, but just for the argument's sake he counted all the sins that he had committed. And he also counted all the sins that he had dreamed about but he had not committed. Still he said, \"The most strict judge cannot put me in jail for more than four and a half years, and God is going to throw me into hellfires for eternity! There seems to be no proportion.\"\nIf you go on committing sin and don't do anything else, just sin and sin and sin from the moment you are born till the moment you are in your grave, then too, an eternity of hellfire is not just, it is not justice.\nGod seems to enjoy hellfire. God seems to enjoy poisoning all your pleasures -- you should not enjoy any of your senses. Different religions have different emphases, but the point is the same. Mohammedans are not allowed to listen to music. Strange? It is sin because you are enjoying a sense, your hearing. You are\ngiving pleasure to your ears, so you are not to be allowed to listen to great music.\nI cannot conceive in what way music can be a sin. But the idea is that enjoyment is sin, so whatever you can enjoy has to be condemned.\nJainism says you should not enjoy taste, you should eat without any taste. You are putting man into such a guilt. How can he avoid tasting? When it is sweet, it is sweet! When it is bitter, it is bitter! On his tongue there are sensitive buds which decide the taste. Unless you have plastic surgery and remove all the buds from your tongue, you cannot manage not to taste the food.\nBut they have poisoned your enjoyment. Just small enjoyments -- eating your food with love and joy with friends is condemned. And it is not only one sense, but all five senses.\nGautam Buddha is against touching a woman. Even touch is a sin, because touching a woman is a joy. She is warmer than you, she is more fragile than you, she is more beautiful than you. And what is wrong if touching a woman gives you joy? Joy cannot be wrong. And you are not harming anybody, you are not interfering by touching the woman against her will. She enjoys being touched; you enjoy being the toucher. Why should God come in between?\nBut he is there always, following you as a judge. He has become your inner conscience.\nYour inner conscience is false! It is created by the religions. So God does not depend only on himself, he depends on the priests to create a conscience in you. It is not consciousness, it is conscience -- a false entity which continuously goes on saying to you,\n\"This is not right. The scriptures are against ... God is against .… Don't do this!\" And your whole nature wants to do it.\nJaina monks are not allowed even to have a bath or a shower, every day, because that is enjoying the coolness of water, enjoying your body's freshness. You can see these people are criminals. The Jaina monk is not allowed even to make his teeth clean. He cannot use any toothbrush, or any toothpaste, or any mouthwash. It is so difficult to talk to a Jaina monk -- his breath is so disgusting, his whole body is disgusting.\nIn a hot country like India you perspire ... and Jaina monks have to travel on dirty, dusty paths. They cannot ride in any vehicle because that is pleasure; they have to walk. So they are walking on dusty roads in villages, and their perspiration under the hot sun, blazing hot, showering fire on the earth ... They become ugly, they become really tanned.\nTheir bodies, their skin shrinks. And dust upon dust, layer upon layer ...\nAll the religions have shared in some way or other the desire that man's every pleasure should be poisoned. Only then will he turn towards the priest to get some advice, because he is miserable. Make him miserable, take away all the possibilities of pleasure.\nI have not come across any Indian woman who knows what orgasm is. In fact, in the Hindi language there is no word equal to òrgasm'. The Indian woman has never known orgasm. Even the Western woman has started to know about orgasm just thirty years ago.\nIt was due to the research of psychologists, psychoanalysts and psychiatrists. Sigmund Freud, Havelock Ellis, Masters and Johnson -- they opened a new door to women's pleasure.\nFor centuries they did not know what orgasm was, so naturally, they were disgusted with sex. They thought that the man was simply using them, because they were not getting any enjoyment out of it. But the reason was that the man has not been allowing them to have an orgasm.\nIn the very primitive days he must have become aware that a woman can have multiple orgasms, and a man can have only one orgasm. So a man is not competent to fulfill a woman. Either he has to call his friends, or he has to get some hormonal injections, because a woman ordinarily is capable of having six orgasms one after the other.\nIt is better not to let her know that she is capable of any orgasm. It can be avoided, because the woman's vagina is insensitive. It has to be insensitive because it will be giving birth to a child. If it was sensitive, the birth of a child would have immensely increased pain; it is insensitive and still there is pain.\nSo the woman's orgasm has nothing to do with the vagina, it is just a reproductive mechanism. Her orgasm is not dependent on a man making love\nthrough the vagina --\nthat is good for reproduction. She has a separate part, just a very small part -- the clitoris -\n- which is not in the way of man's making love to her. Unless the man understands the physiology of the woman, which ordinarily no man understands\n...\nMan is the only inexperienced lover in the world, because neither does he have any experience before your marriage, nor does the woman have any experience before the marriage. This is a very strange world. When two people are going to live together for their whole lives they don't have any experience, they don't know what to do.\nThe woman's clitoris is the organ which gives her pleasure, and it is not part of her vagina. Man's ejaculation is just two minutes or three minutes at the most. And he has to be quick, because if you are committing sin, commit it quickly. Don't do it too long, otherwise, remember hellfire.\nUnless a man understands the physiology of a woman, which he has never bothered ...\nher whole body is sexually sensitive. Man's whole body is not sexually sensitive. The man's sexuality is very local; it is just in his sexual machinery. The woman's whole body is sexual, and unless the man plays with her whole body and arouses her body -- that is foreplay ... No man wants to do it, because it will take too long, and one has to be quick before God comes in. So no more foreplay!\nChristians particularly, introduced the missionary position, in which the beauty is under, and the beast is on top. The poor woman has to lie down almost dead, and only then is she considered to be a lady. Only prostitutes enjoy. No woman of honor will groan or moan, or start gibberish or screaming out of joy. So she has been told to be completely dead while the man is making love. It is one-sided love. The other side is completely dead; the other side has not been aroused.\nThe people who understand sexology say the woman should be on top so that she has more possibility of movement, and the man should be underneath her so he can remain silent, because his ejaculation happens in just two minutes! If he remains silent he can manage twenty minutes or thirty minutes. A woman needs\nat least ten minutes to become aroused. This disparity is there, and it can be fulfilled only if the man understands that the woman is not just a mechanism to be used. She is also a soul, equally alive, and has all rights to pleasure just as you have.\nSo foreplay is needed, and the man should be underneath and the woman should be on top. The man should lie down like a lady, and the woman should be a real rascal! Then only is there a possibility that they come to orgasm at the same time. When they both start throbbing and getting out of control, that is the moment when they know what sex contains. It is not only a reproductive organ, it is also an organ of immense pleasure. And that pleasure, according to me, gives you the first glimpse of meditation, because the mind stops, time stops. For those few moments there is no time, and there is no mind, you are just utterly silent and blissful.\nI say it -- it is my scientific approach to the subject -- because there was no other way for man to find out that if there is no mind and no time, you enter into a blissful state. Except for sex there was no other possibility for the mind to understand that there was some way of going beyond mind, beyond time. It was certainly sex which gave the first glimpse of meditativeness. And I am being condemned all over the world because I am telling people the truth.\nNobody has come up with any other idea to explain how you have found meditation. You cannot find it by just walking on the side of the road -- it is lying there and you go over and pick up meditation. Where have you found meditation? Not a single person in the whole world ... and I have been discussed around the world, condemned, just because I am talking about going from sex to superconsciousness. But nobody has given any explanation why they are condemning me because of my book -- which has been translated into thirty-four languages, has gone into dozens of editions, and is read by all the monks whether they are Hindu, Jaina, Christian, Buddhist. Monks are the best customers for that book.\nHere there was a Jaina conference just a few months ago, and my secretary, Neelam, informed me, \"It is strange. Jaina monks come and they ask for one book only, FROM\nSEX TO SUPERCONSCIOUSNESS. Then they hide it in their clothes and just get out of the door silently so nobody finds them out.\"\nThe book, FROM SEX TO SUPERCONSCIOUSNESS, is not about sex, it is about superconsciousness. But the only possible way for man to find that there is some door, some way to go beyond his thoughts into eternal silence ... Even though it lasts only one moment, that moment is eternity -- everything stops. You forget all the worries, all the tensions.\nHave you ever heard of any man getting a heart attack while he was making love? It should have happened more often if the religions were true. God would be so angry, that at least he could give a heart attack. Hellfire will be after death; right now ...\nBut no man has died while making love, because making love takes away your stress. It is stress that can give you a heart attack. It is stress that can drive you mad and insane. It is sex that keeps you sane, keeps you normal, keeps you within the boundaries of sanity.\nOtherwise you are going to be a pervert, and perversion does not give you the same key of superconsciousness.\nHomosexuals cannot have the same experience that is possible in a heterosexual relationship. Nor can lesbians have the same orgasmic experience. But ten percent of American men have accepted that they have homosexual tendencies, and thousands of women have married women -- lesbian couples. And this year it is expected that forty thousand babies will be born out of lesbian couples. From where are these babies coming? From artificial insemination. Now hospitals are not only carrying a blood bank, but a semen bank. So when a lesbian couple wants a baby, the one who is ready to take the trouble for nine months, gets an injection of somebody anonymous. An injection is not a joy. An injection cannot give you any orgasm. Although doctors call it \"the prick,\"\nit is not the prick.\nWhen my personal physician, Amrito, came for the first time from England -- and he is a member of the Royal College of Physicians, highly educated -- he would say to me,\n\"Now comes the prick!\" Then I would start laughing, \"Amrito, this is not the prick. You have been misguided.\" Now he silently gives me the injection without saying anything.\nThese forty thousand babies will be born this year in America through an injection. Now those women are completely out of the possibility of having an orgasm. And there are homosexuals all around the world, even very intelligent people.\nI have chosen this title, I CELEBRATE MYSELF from one of the most important poets of America, Walt Whitman. But he was a homosexual -- that's where he goes wrong. All his poetry becomes superficial; he knows nothing about orgasmic joy. But you will be surprised to know that even a man like Socrates was a homosexual; hence he could not become a Gautam Buddha. Howsoever intelligent, and howsoever great a logician he was, his dialogues are great but something is missing. He is not a man of great consciousness. He has become unnatural, he has gone against nature.\nBut religions are forcing people to go against nature. The third man in England's hierarchy of the church ... the archbishop in England's church is equivalent to the Polack pope. This man has only one man between him and the archbishop, and there is every possibility that this bishop will some time become archbishop of England. He has come with the idea that celibacy simply means no heterosexual relationship, but it does not include homosexuality, it does not include masturbation, it does not include making love to an animal -- sodomy, bestiality. It does not include anything. Celibacy simply prevents you from being heterosexual. Great religious leaders ...!\nFifty percent of monks in monasteries are homosexuals. And there are possibilities like the monastery of Mount Athos where thousands of monks live\n... They have not seen any woman since they have become monks, because no woman is allowed to enter -- not even a six-month-old girl is allowed into the monastery. When I heard this, I thought, \"Are those monks, monks or monsters?\" And they have their own church-state, so they have their own guards and police.\nFor one thousand years no woman has ever entered into the monastery. And anybody who becomes a monk in the Mount Athos monastery cannot get out alive again. Only when he is dead, will his body be taken out; it is a lifelong commitment. No intelligent man can commit himself even for tomorrow. Who knows what will happen tomorrow?\nThat's what I call responsibility. A man who is responsible will not commit\nhimself to anything, will not promise anything, because who knows about tomorrow? Let tomorrow come and we will see. I will respond with my totality whatever the situation, but I cannot commit myself. I have never promised anybody anything. I have never committed myself to anything in my whole life. Let the tomorrow come. One never knows, this may be my last day and I may not be there tomorrow to fulfill my promise.\nTime goes on changing -- I may not be the same tomorrow, you may not be the same tomorrow. Today there is great love between me and you. Tomorrow, who knows? Love disappears, not only disappears, but sometimes turns into hate.\nA man of awareness lives moment to moment -- that is his celebration. He enjoys everything of the world without any inhibition. Because God is dead he need not be worried. And with God, hell is dead, hellfire has been put off. With him, heaven is also dead. So don't be greedy for heaven, and don't be afraid of hell. Just live moment to moment with a dance, with a joy, with cheerfulness, with courage.\nEncounter every situation with your total consciousness, without any guilt. Enjoy music, enjoy food, enjoy love -- enjoy everything that is natural.\nGod has been against nature, God has been against enlightenment, and God has been against your experience of eternity.\nGod was your enemy.\nIt is good that he is dead.\nThis is the good news for this evening. Now your questions.\nQuestion 1\nThe first question:\nI HAVE BEEN SURROUNDED SINCE MY CHILDHOOD BY PEOPLE WHO\nWANTED ME TO BELIEVE IN GOD AND TO FOLLOW HIS COMMANDMENTS.\nWHY ARE THE GOD BELIEVERS ALWAYS TRYING TO CONVERT OTHERS?\nThis is a very delicate question.\nYou may not immediately grasp why God believers are always trying to convert others.\nThe reason is they have their own doubts, and by converting others they are able to repress their doubts. If they can convert many people ... by converting others they are also converting themselves. When they see that one thousand people have started believing in God -- \"Perhaps God is. My doubt was useless.\" When they see that the whole world believes in God -- the whole world cannot be wrong. That is the argument, very ancient, as ancient as man: the whole world cannot be wrong. And I say unto you, only single individuals, rare individuals have been right. When something is believed by the whole world, remember, it is certainly going to be wrong! The masses are living like somnambulists, sleepwalkers, in utter unconsciousness. Their belief systems cannot be right.\nI have told you a small story .…\nOne journalist died, and as journalists are pushy people he knocked immediately on the Pearly Gates. He took it for granted that he was going to Heaven and that he was going to have an interview with God. This would be the first interview ever.\nSaint Peter opened the doors. He asked, \"What do you want?\" He said, \"An interview with God, and this is my card.\"\nBut Saint Peter said, \"You cannot enter Heaven. Your name is not on the list. And anyway we don't need any journalists. We have a quota: one dozen journalists, and they are already in.\"\nAnd they are useless in Heaven because nothing happens, no sensation. All the saints are almost dead -- sitting on their white clouds, playing their harp, \"Alleluia! Alleluia!\" Now this is going to be forever, so what news ...?\nGeorge Bernard Shaw exactly defined what news is: When a dog bites a man, it is not news; when a man bites a dog, it is news.\nBut in Heaven, there are no dogs, only dead-as-dodo saints.\n\"So the newspaper started,\" Saint Peter told him, \"but only the first issue was published.\nThere was no news for the second issue. So even those twelve journalists are just waiting for nothing.\n\"It is good you knock on the other door; that is Hell, and there is always great news there.\nEverything that you may not have even imagined is happening, because all the great intellectuals are there, all the great politicians are there, all the great criminals are there ...\neverybody of any importance is there! So you go there.\"\nHe said, \"But being a journalist, I cannot go so easily. You will have to give me at least twenty-four hours to have a look around Heaven. If I can persuade some journalist from your quota to go to Hell, are you ready to accept me?\"\nSaint Peter said, \"It doesn't matter. If somebody is ready to go to Hell you can take his place. This is good. For twenty-four hours you can have a walk around.\"\nThe moment he entered Heaven he started spreading a lie that there was going to be a very great newspaper starting soon in Hell, and a chief editor, and an associate chief editor, assistant editors, and all kinds of journalists were needed. He went on spreading the news so it reached to all the twelve journalists.\nAfter twenty-four hours he went to see Saint Peter, to inquire whether anybody had gone out. Saint Peter immediately closed the door and told him, \"You remain in. All the twelve have gone out.\"\nHe said, \"My God! All have gone out? Then I don't want to be here. Something must be right, otherwise I could not have convinced twelve people.\"\nSaint Peter said, \"Are you sane or insane? You created the lie.\"\nHe said, \"I know I created the lie, but there must be something corresponding actually happening. I cannot remain here, just open the doors!\"\nThat is the reason why every religion is interested in converting people, because every religion, every priest, every pope, every saint, every Ayatollah Khomeini, every shankaracharya, are all deep down full of doubt because belief cannot destroy doubt.\nBelief can only repress doubt. A blind man can believe in light, but that does not mean he knows light. All your believers are blind people who don't know anything about the truth.\nHence the doubt is just repressed underneath the belief.\nTo keep one's belief strong enough, one needs to propagate it continuously. That's why all the religious propagandists you see are very fundamentalist, almost fanatics, fascists.\nHave you seen the Jehovah Witnesses? They go on shouting, beating their drums, shouting whether you listen or not. They don't look at your eyes, they just look at the ground and they go on shouting, and they go on reading passages from the Bible. Just to get rid of them people purchase their Bibles.\nWhy are these people so much interested in converting people? The psychological reason is they are afraid. Their own belief is very thin; anytime doubt may arise. Doubt is very existential. Belief is only a program that has been given by your parents, and by your priests, and by your teachers, and by your society. But it is only a program.\nIn the Soviet Union they are giving a different program: there is no God. Every child believes that there is no God. All communists believe there is no God.\nHalf of the world is communist now, so half of the world for the first time believes there is no God. It is not that they know, it is not that they have explored the outer sky, or they have explored the inner consciousness and have found that there is no God. They just have been told, just as you have been told that there is God.\nEvery religion tries to convert people, because those who are inside the fold are full of doubt. When the fold starts growing, their doubts are settled, their belief becomes thicker, weightier -- \"So many people cannot be wrong.\"\nAnd have you watched this? Whenever a person moves from one religion to\nanother religion, the new religion that he has entered gives him great respect and honor. The older religion condemns him, that he has betrayed, but the new religion gives him great honor because he has confirmed their belief -- \"Even people belonging to other religions are coming into our fold. Our fold must have the truth, otherwise why are people coming?\"\nAll these missionaries all around the world bringing people to Catholicism are just making the Catholics inside the fold believe, \"You are the real religion, and other religions are just so-so.\"\nA man of truth never tries to convert you.\nA man of truth conveys his experience to you. He shares his experience with you, but that does not mean that you have to agree with him. It does not mean either that you have to disagree with him. It was his joy to share, and that's where he is finished.\nNo man of truth has been ever a missionary. All missionaries are trying to convince the insiders that they are right because outsiders are coming in. All missionaries are trying to convince themselves also, that their belief system must have some truth in it; otherwise why do people get converted?\nSo that is the reason God believers are always trying to convert other people. Otherwise, conversion is an interference into other people's freedom. You can enjoy sharing with your friends, with their consent, whatever you have experienced -- not your beliefs but your experience. And if you have no experience, be honest, be truthful. Say, \"I don't have any experience. I have only a bunch of beliefs others have given me, which are not my experience. I am carrying borrowed knowledge, I don't know anything on my own, hence I cannot recommend anything to you.\"\nWhat am I doing here? I am not trying to convert you to any religion, or to any cult, or to any creed. I don't have any belief system, I don't have any theology, I don't have any philosophy, I don't have any religion. What I am trying to convey is my experience of truth. If it can be of any use to you, you can use it. If you see it is not of any use to you, that's perfectly all right. It is your freedom, I will not interfere in your freedom. I will not trespass your individuality. I respect you, I love you. How can I convert you?\nSo no man of truth, no man of compassion, no man of authentic experience is\never a converter. It is all those believers, who are afraid of their own doubt, who want to keep the insiders in, and go on bringing new people from outside. It helps the believers to have thicker beliefs, and thicker beliefs make your intelligence also retarded. The thicker the belief, the more retarded the intelligence. No belief helps your intelligence to grow, even though there is space enough to grow. When you go on pushing beliefs and hiding your doubt in your unconscious corners of darkness, you are crippling yourself. You are destroying your own buddhahood, you are destroying your own potential.\nYou could have been one of the enlightened ones, but you will remain just a Catholic, or a Hindu, or a Mohammedan. And these are all fictions, beautiful fictions. You can enjoy them as stories, as novels, but don't call them \"holy\" scriptures.\nFour hundred and eighty-eight pages in the Holy Bible are pure pornography. I sometimes wonder why people go on missing those four hundred and eighty- eight pages -\n- not one page, or two pages. I told one of my friends to pick out all those pages, and he has published a book of four hundred and eighty-eight pages taken out of the Old Testament. Every passage is so obscene, so ugly, and you go on calling it the Holy Bible.\nEven playboys and their magazine PLAYBOY, and the playgirls and their magazine PLAYGIRL, and PENTHOUSE are nothing compared to the Holy Bible.\nThey are nothing compared to the temples of Khajuraho in India. Even Mahatma Gandhi was so ashamed that he wanted thirty temples of Khajuraho ... which are great sculpture.\nNowhere have have men and women been sculpted so beautifully -- but they are making love, they are utterly naked, and millions of statues in those thirty temples ...\nThere used to be one hundred temples; seventy have been destroyed by the Mohammedans. Thirty were saved because they were hidden behind thick forest.\nMahatma Gandhi wanted them to be covered with mud so nobody could see them.\nYou must have heard about the three famous monkeys of Mahatma Gandhi -- he used to keep them on his table. Even though he is dead, they are still sitting on his table. Those three monkeys were sent from Japan by a friend. They are a beautiful piece of sculpture, but they are not complete. They came from China to Japan, and the original set used to be of four monkeys, not three.\nThe fourth monkey seems to have been taken by the friend out of the set, or perhaps ... I suspect Mahatma Gandhi himself cut the fourth monkey out of the set. I have to describe the monkeys so you can understand why he should have cut ... because three is not the original set.\nThe first monkey is keeping his hands on his ears. The second monkey is keeping his hands on his eyes. The third monkey is keeping his hands on his mouth. And the fourth monkey is missing.\nThe fourth monkey -- I know the fourth monkey. In the original set the fourth monkey was holding his hands on his genitals.\nMahatma Gandhi interpreted them -- I don't agree with his interpretation. He interpreted that the monkey who is holding his hands on the ears says, \"Don't listen to anything evil.\"\nAnd the monkey who is holding his hands on the eyes says, \"Don't see anything evil.\"\nAnd the third monkey who has his hands on the mouth is indicating, \"Don't say anything evil.\" Now, you can understand why the fourth monkey has been dropped -- in fact he should not have been dropped if Gandhi had really been a man of truth. The fourth monkey is the logical conclusion: \"Hide the origin of all evil.\"\nBut this is not my interpretation. Knowing the people, and knowing that Charles Darwin has this great idea that man has come from monkeys -- and there is every possibility, because your mind still functions like a monkey. My interpretation, when I went to see Mahatma Gandhi's ashram ... He was dead, but his son Ramdas was my friend, so he invited me and he showed me around. It is an ugly place -- Mahatma Gandhi was a great self-torturer and he forced torture on other people.\nI said, \"These three monkeys ... where is the fourth? -- because I know the whole\nset.\"\nHe said, \"I have never heard about the fourth.\" And he told me Mahatma Gandhi's interpretation.\nI said, \"That is not right. Looking at humanity, looking into humanity's psychology ...\nThe first monkey says, `Don't listen to the truth because it will disturb all your consoling lies.'\n\"The second monkey says, `Don't look at the truth; otherwise your God will be dead and your heaven and hell will disappear.'\n\"The third monkey says, `Don't speak the truth, otherwise you will be condemned, crucified, poisoned, tortured by the whole crowd, the unconscious people. You will be condemned -- don't speak the truth!'\n\"And the missing fourth monkey says, `Hide your pleasures. Hide your enjoyment, don't show it to anybody.'\"\nPeople can respect you if you are miserable, but if you are happy everybody is jealous of you.\nPeople have been asking me why my commune failed in America. It never failed. The reason it was destroyed by the violence of the American government was that it was such a successful experiment. Never has there been a commune in the whole history of man so successful.\nThat was the trouble. If we had failed, nobody would have bothered about us, but we succeeded. In five years we fought against the greatest power in the world -- and we had no power. We were not a nation, we had no army ... but we had truth on our side.\nThe commune was destroyed because it was successful.\nThe fourth monkey is saying, \"Keep your pleasures, your joys, hidden. Don't let anybody know that you are a cheerful man, a blissful man, an ecstatic man, because that will destroy your very life. It is dangerous.\"\nAnd looking at humanity I can say without any doubt that my interpretation is far better than Mahatma Gandhi's. He himself for his whole life was teaching celibacy. But he was an honest man, about that I have no doubt. His honesty is clear. Even at the age of seventy he was having nightmares about sex, and in his dreams he was ejaculating -- at the age of seventy! This is a whole life of suppression. Otherwise by the time a man is forty-two, if he has lived his life joyfully, without guilt, without any God, without any religion, just naturally, flowing with nature with a deep relaxation, in a let-go ... by the time he is forty- two he will become aware that these pleasures were very momentary.\nAnd now death is approaching, he has to find something more eternal.\nThese pleasures will have indicated the way to him, that if in a sexual orgasm, time and mind stop and you feel as if you are part of eternity ... you disappear as an ego and you become simply one with the whole. It happens only for a moment, but it can happen ... on your own if you can manage to go beyond the mind and beyond time -- no need for a woman, no need for a man. Every man, every woman is capable of going beyond. Once you know it is possible, then you can manage it.\nThat's what meditation is -- just getting beyond the mind and beyond time, and you have entered into eternal silence, into eternal life. And once you have tasted that life your whole existence becomes a celebration.\nQuestion 2\nThe second question:\nWOULD YOU AGREE WITH STENDHAL WHEN HE SAYS, \"GOD'S ONLY EXCUSE IS THAT HE DOES NOT EXIST\"?\nAbsolutely!\nIf God existed, he would have been murdered long ago. Man could not have tolerated him; he was an enemy. It is good that he does not exist, so you can go on praying ... Just think .…\nThere is a story, a very ancient story .…\nOnce God used to live just in the marketplace, but the whole day, even in the night people were knocking on the doors and complaining about everything: \"This is not the right kind of world you have created. Why is there so much sickness? If you are the creator, then why do you create bodies which are sick? Why is there old age, and why is there death?\"\nSo people tortured him so much, the old story says, that he called a council of his angels and asked them, \"I will either die out of this constant torture, or I will have to commit suicide! Can you tell me what I should do? These people don't leave me for a single moment and their demands are such that I cannot fulfill them. One woman comes and she says, `Tomorrow, remember, no rain because I am trying to dry my wheat.' And another man says, `Tomorrow I absolutely need rain because I am sowing my seeds.' Now what am I to do?\n\"And there are millions of people shouting and angry because their desire has not been fulfilled, their prayer has not been heard.\"\nSo the angels thought. One angel said, \"It is good if you move to Everest, the highest peak of the Himalayas.\"\nGod said, \"You don't know it but I am omniscient, I know everything -- past, present, future. Soon there will be a man who will reach to the highest peak of the Himalayas.\nAnd once one man has found me, there will be buses and airplanes, and all kinds of vehicles. And they will make roads and hotels, and again there will be the marketplace.\nYou don't understand: it will only be just a little peace for a short time. That won't do. I will have to change my place again.\"\nSo somebody suggested, \"Why don't you move to the moon?\"\nHe said, \"You don't understand because you don't know the future -- just after Everest they are going to go to the moon. So I will have to change again. Show me something from where I have not to change!\"\nThen an old angel came close to him and whispered in his ear, \"The only place man may never think of is within his own heart. You just sit there ...\"\nHe has disappeared from everywhere. Perhaps you can encounter something of divineness in your own being. In your own life you may find something which is godly.\nYou will not find God as a person, you will find a quality, a fragrance, a presence; a certain air, a certain energy which is not yours, which belongs to the cosmos.\nStendhal is perfectly right: \"God's only excuse is that he does not exist.\" That is saving him; otherwise there was no safety, no security.\nFriedrich Nietzsche in his, THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA, comes to a point where Zarathustra is coming down from his mountain cave where he has lived many, many years. And he finds on the way an old hermit's hut, and the hermit is praying to God.\nEarly in the morning, as the sun is rising, the hermit is praying.\nAnd Zarathustra murmurs to himself, \"Is it possible that this old hermit has not heard that God is dead?\"\nWhen Zarathustra goes down he tells the crowd, \"Have you heard the news that God is dead?\" They all start laughing.\nThey say, \"You must be insane. Living in a cave for many, many years alone, has made you a crackpot.\"\nNietzsche himself became mad in the last phase of his life, because he declared really good news but he could not manage to find something to replace God. He could not find the celebration of life, he could not find the experience of the living stream within you.\nHe remained in a vacuum -- in a vacuum you are going to be mad.\nMore people go mad in the West than in the East. More people commit suicide in the West than in the East. More people murder in the West than in the East. It should be otherwise -- the East is so poor that people should commit suicide, should go mad ... but they don't. What is happening?\nThe Western mind has come to know God is not there -- an immense vacuum.\nAnd man cannot live without meaning, man cannot live without significance, man cannot live without joy. If God is dead, man has become absolutely empty, and man cannot live in emptiness.\nHe needs juices of life flowing through him. He needs to blossom into beautiful lotuses.\nHe needs to sing songs, he needs to play music. He needs all the blessings that existence makes available to you.\nThe Western man is more educated, is more rich, hence his bodily needs are almost fulfilled. He looks at the sky and finds the sky is empty -- there is no God. This understanding that there is no God, rather than becoming good news to the Western man has become bad news. He feels accidental, unnecessary -- there is no reason why he should be here.\nThe East knows three religions which don't have any God -- Jainism, Buddhism, Taoism\n-- three religions which are not centered on God. And these three religions seem to be saner than the religions which have come out of Judaism -- Judaism, Christianity, Mohammedanism. These three Eastern religions seem to be more sane, because from the very beginning there is no God. So they don't have to look upward in the sky, they have to look inward. That is the only place where they have to explore for truth.\nPrayer is not the way; meditation is the way.\nAnd those who have come to the ultimate experience of meditation -- a Gautam Buddha, a Bodhidharma, a Mahakashyapa, a Mahavira, a Lao Tzu, a Chuang Tzu, a Ma Tzu, a Sekito ... they all don't even talk about God. That which does not exist -- what is the point even to say that he does not exist? It is simply out of the question to discuss God, to discuss heaven and hell.\nHence I want you to understand that Zen has come as a flowering out of the meeting of Gautam Buddha and Lao Tzu. It is the meeting of Dhamma and Tao. It is a crossbreed of Bodhidharma and Chuang Tzu. These two religions have reached to the highest peak, and they are unorganized religions. Where they have become organized they are dead. For example, in Tibet it became organized, it became dead. In Sri Lanka it became organized, it became dead.\nWherever religion becomes organized it becomes dead because it is immediately a desire for power, a desire to dominate. It becomes politics instead of religion.\nOrganization destroys the individual, sacrifices the individual, and the individual is the only one who can know the highest peaks of consciousness and the depths of consciousness.\nOut of the meeting of Gautam Buddha and Lao Tzu, Zen is born. Zen is neither Buddhism, nor is it Tao; it is both, just as you are both your mother and your father. You are neither -- something of your father, something of your mother is flowing in you.\nZen has come to the highest point of expression. It has become almost synonymous with eternal life. Adam and Eve could not eat the fruit of the eternal life, they were expelled from the Garden of Eden. They had only eaten the fruit of knowledge. But Zen gives you the other tree, the tree of eternal life.\nSo in this series we will be discussing Zen, as equivalent to eternal life. God is no where.\nLife is now here.\nAnd Zen is the master key to open the doors of the mystery of life. The sutra:\nOUR BELOVED MASTER, SEKITO SAID:\nMY TEACHING, WHICH HAS COME DOWN FROM THE ANCIENT BUDDHAS, IS\nNOT DEPENDENT ON MEDITATION OR ON DILIGENT APPLICATION OF ANY\nKIND.\nThe word `meditation' here may give you a feeling of misunderstanding, of\nconfusion, because in English there are three words: concentration, contemplation, meditation. None of these three words is capable of translating the Sanskrit word dhyana, which became in Buddha's language -- he used Pali, a different language from Sanskrit -- zhana. And when Bodhidharma took the message to China, from zhana it became ch'ana. And when Rinzai took the message from China to Japan, from ch'an or ch'ana, it became zen. It came closer to Buddha's zhan or zhana.\nBut there is no equivalent word in English, because even the word `meditation' gives the idea that you are meditating upon something. Concentrating upon something, contemplating about something, meditating upon something -- but dhyan, or zen, are without any object.\nZen means neither are you contemplating nor are you concentrating, nor are you meditating, because there is no object. You simply are -- silent, no thought, no mind.\nIt is because of this, Sekito includes meditation also: \"One does not need meditation or a diligent application of any kind to become the enlightened one.\"\nBut for your understanding and clarity, when I use the word `meditation' -- it is a poor word, it does not have the same quality as `dhyan' or `zen' -- I use it because there is no other word in the English language.\nAnd there is a reason why there is no other word -- the West never came to the point of dhyana. It never came to the point where one simply is -- neither doing anything outwardly nor doing anything inwardly. One simply is -- a pure isness, an utter silence.\nThat brings you to your very center, and the moment you are at the very center you start growing into a buddha, into an enlightened one. Your awareness for the first time opens its petals the way a lotus opens its petals when it is daybreak when the sun starts rising, when the night is over.\nSekito is right: no special discipline is needed. No special application of any kind is needed. No mind effort is needed -- that's what he means by meditation. What you need is just to leave everything aside. Transcend the body, the mind, the heart. Just go on transcending till you come to a point which is the end of the road. There -- you simply are.\nBasho says:\nSITTING SILENTLY DOING NOTHING, SPRING COMES --\nAND THE GRASS GROWS BY ITSELF.\nYou don't have to do anything, you have just to sit silently doing nothing, because any kind of doing is going to take you away from yourself. When you are not doing anything, the whole energy gathers inside; it is not invested anywhere. The moment you pass your mind, all the energy that was invested in thoughts is released. When you pass your heart, all the energy that was invested in your emotions, feelings, sentiments, is released.\nNow you are becoming too full of energy. This abundance of energy gives you the first taste of existence, and as this energy becomes a pillar of tremendous height and depth, you have found the connection with the cosmos. You are no longer alone. In fact, you are no more, only existence is. Then the existence, the cosmos, the life, is a sheer dance.\nI teach you to be dancers. I teach you to be lovers.\nI am absolutely life affirmative, and your all religions are life negative.\nI am utterly devoted to the present moment. Don't move into the past because that is memory; there is no relevant existence to your memory anymore. Don't move into the future because that is only imagination.\nJust remain here, and you will be surprised. If you are just now here, all thoughts disappear, because all thoughts are either of the past or of the future. No thought is of the present.\nThe present is so pure, so clean, so clear, just an opening into the cosmos. This is Zen, and this is the key to enter into life eternal. The very feel of life eternal takes all tensions, anxieties of old age, of sickness, of death, and birth away from\nyou.\nYou have never been born and you will never die. It is the body that has been changing.\nYou have been changing houses. But you are the reality, the truth.\nThe truth is not outside you, it is at the innermost hidden center.\nSo Zen simply means doing nothing, just being. And in that utter silence of being, you slowly slowly relax, and the spring comes and the grass grows by itself. You suddenly start blossoming -- your eyes start having a new depth. Your gestures start having a new grace -- your every act becomes sheer joy. It may be just chopping wood, it may be just carrying water from the well -- it doesn't matter.\nOnce you know you are not accidental to existence, once you know you are existence itself, life takes a tremendous quantum leap. You are no longer confined to the body, you are no longer confined to the small mind. You become vast and infinite, and only in this vastness and infinity can you rejoice, can you be blissful.\nAnd this vastness has become available to you because God is dead; otherwise he was occupying every place, he was watching you from every side. He was judging you continuously, poking his nose into your affairs, condemning you -- \"This is wrong, don't do it.\" And all his commandments were against life.\nI have heard an old story .…\nWhen God made the world he went with his commandments to the Babylonians first, and asked them, \"Would you like to have a commandment?\"\nThey said, \"First, we would like to know what the commandment is.\" And he said, \"Thou should not commit adultery.\"\nThey said, \"Forget all about it. Without adultery there is no joy in life. Just take\nyour commandments.\"\nGod was very much disappointed, \"What kind of people are these?\" He went to the Egyptians ... the same question.\n\"What are the commandments? First we have to know it before we take one\" -- and nobody was ready to take it.\nAnd then he found Moses who asked a wrong question. When God said, \"Would you like to have a commandment?\" Moses said, \"How much? How much does it cost?\"\nGod said, \"It is free.\"\nMoses said, \"Then why one? I will have ten.\"\nBut when God is no longer there, all his commandments disappear and all his holy scriptures disappear, and the world becomes one for the first time. No religions, no religious boundaries, no discrimination -- without God, humanity is one.\nZen teaches you not only to be one with humanity, but to be one with the trees and the rivers, and the mountains and the sky and the stars. This whole universe is our being. We are just flowers of different colors giving a beautiful variety to existence. We are expressions of existence, unique expressions. That gives you pride, that gives you dignity. That gives you an intrinsic honor, a self-respect which you were not able to have if God was alive.\nBut the whole of humanity has not heard even yet. They are still praying to a fiction, and that fiction is making the whole humanity schizophrenic, neurotic, obscene, ugly.\nThree rabbis were sitting on a park bench one evening .…\nThey used to come to that park every evening -- old rabbis. One was seventy- five, one was eighty-five, one was ninety-five -- all retired.\nThe youngest rabbi who was seventy-five looked very sad. The second rabbi who was eighty-five asked him, \"What is the matter? Why are you so sad this\nevening?\"\nHe said, \"What to do? I have to tell you so that I can be unburdened. It happened that a beautiful lady was a guest in my house, and when she was taking a bath I looked through the keyhole at her beautiful proportionate body.\"\nBoth the rabbis started laughing.\nThe second rabbi said, \"You idiot. Everybody does that in their childhood.\"\nBut the youngest rabbi said, \"You have not heard the whole story and you have interfered. I was caught red-handed by my mother.\"\nThose two rabbis said, \"We know. Everybody gets caught. This is nothing to be sad about.\"\nBut the man said, \"You don't understand at all. This happened today! It is not a question of childhood.\"\nThey said, \"Then it is a serious matter.\"\n\"But it is nothing,\" the second rabbi said. \"What is happening to me, you don't know ...\"\nHis problem was that he had not made love to his wife for three days. And both the rabbis started laughing, because they both knew what his \"love\" was. At the age of eighty-five, one leg in the grave, one leg out -- what was his love? They already knew it, so they both laughed.\nHe said, \"Why are you laughing?\"\nThey said, \"We are laughing at your love. Don't be worried about it.\"\nHis love was, he would take the hand of the wife before going to sleep, squeeze it three times, and say goodnight. That was his love.\nBut wives are wives, and even this much love the wife was not allowing him for three days. She would turn and say, \"I have a headache; you just go to sleep.\"\nSo he said, \"For three days she has had a headache. At exactly the moment I try\nto make love to her, she says, Ì have a headache; you just go to sleep.'\"\nThe third, the oldest rabbi said, \"You are all idiots. You don't understand real problems.\nThe real problem is happening to me. Just this morning when I was going to make love to my wife she started screaming, Àre you a sex maniac? The whole night you have been making love again and again and again.'\"\nSo he said to his friends, \"It seems I am losing my memory. I thought it was the first time.\"\nA repressed humanity is going to have all these problems. But who has created all these problems? Your God, your priests ... they are the greatest criminals, because very piously they appear to be your well-wishers, but they have destroyed everything in you.\nZen wants you to resurrect, to take hold of your life again, which you have given to somebody else to be taken care of. Be a master, and you will start blossoming flowers of beauty and blissfulness and ecstasy, and a divine drunkenness.\nSekito says, \"WHEN YOU ATTAIN THE INSIGHT AS ATTAINED BY THE BUDDHA, YOU REALIZE THAT NO-MIND is BUDDHA ...\" Just going\nbeyond the mind, and you have become a buddha. It is such a small passage, so\nsmall a journey --\nperhaps a single step. But because you are not total, I tell you about three steps. I divide one step into three steps, because you are hesitant to take such a jump -- one step.\nOtherwise there is only one step: from mind to no-mind. But because you hesitate to go beyond the mind, you are afraid you may go insane. That is true. If you go beyond the mind from the wrong door, you will be insane.\nThere are two doors to go beyond the mind: one goes below the mind, one goes beyond the mind. Both are outside the mind. If you enter from the lower door, you will be insane, and you will be lying on a psychiatrist's couch. If you enter the no-mind from the above door, you will be a buddha. No buddha has ever suffered from any madness, any neurosis, any psychosis -- nothing.\n\"WHEN YOU ATTAIN THE INSIGHT AS ATTAINED BY THE BUDDHA, YOU\nREALIZE THAT NO-MIND is BUDDHA AND BUDDHA is NO-MIND\" --\nthey are synonymous -- THAT NO-MIND, BUDDHA, SENTIENT BEINGS, bodhi, AND klesa, ARE OF ONE AND THE SAME SUBSTANCE WHILE THEY VARY IN NAMES.\nEverything is made of the same stuff, the same existence, the same consciousness of no-mind; only names differ. You can call it anything -- nirvana; you can call it salvation; you can call it liberation. But these are different names of the same space which accurately described is just no-mind, or beyond the mind. You appear in a space which has no limits, no boundaries, and suddenly you become aware that your being has been here since eternity, and it is going to be here forever.\nThis very no-mind is the buddha, and this very moment is the lotus paradise. You don't have to go anywhere. You have to just sink inwards to find the bottom of your being.\n\"YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT YOUR OWN NO-MIND ESSENCE IS NEITHER\nSUBJECT TO ANNIHILATION NOR ETERNALLY SUBSISTING, IS NEITHER\nPURE NOR DEFILED.\"\nIt is so pure that you cannot even call it pure, because it is never defiled. Anything pure can be defiled, but it is so pure you cannot even call it pure. It cannot be defiled, its purity is absolute. No dust ever gathers on the mirror of your consciousness.\nThis makes a tremendous point. The sinner and the saint are both capable to go into no-mind, because the sinner cannot defile his no-mind, the saint cannot purify it. It is always beyond duality.\nIt is so pure and so innocent -- available to the sinner, available to the saint. Both have to go beyond their mind. The sinner has to go beyond the sinning mind, and the saint has to go beyond the saintly mind. But both have to go beyond the\nmind, and they reach to the same space of absolute purity. It is transcendental to all dualities; it simply is. You cannot name it, you cannot utter a single word about it.\nOne of the most important logicians of the West, Ludwig Wittgenstein, has written in his great work, TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS... he wrote in a very strange and special style, the style that has been used in the Zen people's sutras. He would only write in small stanzas and put numbers. Every stanza, every line was complete in itself, made a complete statement. So he would number -- not the pages, but he would number the first sutra, the second sutra, the third sutra, the fourth sutra ...\nOne of the maxims -- sutra means maxim, the smallest condensed statement -- I came across when I was a student says: That which cannot be said should not be said. A complete statement -- if you cannot say anything about no-mind, then please don't say anything, because whatever you say will be wrong. Whatever you say will not be exactly what you wanted to say. So please don't say anything about that which is inexpressible.\nI wrote a letter to him, but he had died. His friend sent me the reply: \"If he was alive he would have accepted your amendment. He was a man of tremendous honesty and he would not have thought that you were criticizing him.\"\nI was not criticizing. I was simply saying to him, \"You are saying, `That which cannot be said should not be said,' but you have said something about it. Remove this maxim. Even to say this much is saying something. That which cannot be said should not be said -- you have said something about it.\" Nothing can be said about the no-mind, including this sentence: Nothing can be said about no-mind.\nIt is a pure experience -- you can experience it. You can have it, you already have it. You can dance with ecstasy when you come to recognize that it has been always there, you just never looked at it. You were so occupied outside, so involved in trivia that the essential got lost. But it is there waiting.\n\"IT REMAINS PERFECTLY UNDISTURBED AND SELF-SUFFICIENT. THE SAME\nIS SO WITH THE WISE AND THE IGNORANT.\"\nThey are made of the same stuff: no-mind -- the wise and the ignorant. The\nignorant have not to become wise before they enter into no-mind. They can enter into no-mind from every place they are -- the sinner, the ignorant, the wise, the knowledgeable. Wherever you are, your distance from no-mind is the same.\nThis is a grand rebellion against all religions. It does not say the sinner has first to become a saint, the immoral has first to become a moral person. Zen gives you a tremendous insight that wherever you are, whoever you are, whatever your actions, nothing can defile, nothing can make it disturbed. From your very space you move directly into no-mind. From different spaces you move to the same center, and you will find your being absolutely clean, utterly clean. It has never been otherwise.\n\"YOUR NO-MIND ESSENCE IS NOT LIMITED IN ITS WORKING, AND IS NOT\nINCLUDED IN THE CATEGORY OF MIND, CONSCIOUSNESS, OR THOUGHT.\n\"THE THREE WORLDS OF DESIRE, FORM, AND NO-FORM, AND THE SIX\nPATHS OF EXISTENCE ARE NO MORE THAN MANIFESTATIONS OF YOUR\nMIND ITSELF.\"\nAll your so-called disciplines, methods, yoga ... all your prayers, are just gimmicks, projections of your own mind. Drop everything!\nI am reminded of a great Catholic bishop .…\nHe had a beautiful parrot who used to recite the Catholic prayer completely. It was a precious parrot. The parrot was shown to all the guests, and he would recite the whole Catholic prayer. And he was such a pious, saintly parrot. He was trained -- he used to have a rosary in one hand, and he would go on saying, \"Alleluia, Alleluia!\" And everybody was surprised that such a pious parrot ...\nBut he looked very sad, as every saint always looks -- you cannot become pious without becoming sad. Because he was looking so sad, the bishop was always worried what to do about it, because otherwise he was absolutely normal.\nOne day he went to see one of the members of his congregation, a woman, who had got a parrot just that day. And the parrot owner had told her, \"I don't want to sell this parrot to you. You can take any other parrot. We have got many in our shop.\" But she became so interested in the parrot -- it was a very beautiful specimen.\nShe said, \"I will pay anything, but only for this parrot.\"\nThe man said, \"I have to tell you that this parrot comes from a very ugly place. He used to be in a whorehouse so he uses four-letter words. That is why I am trying to prevent you from taking it.\"\nBut the lady said, \"I will teach him, but I will take it.\" He was so beautiful looking that she thought, \"If he can speak four-letter words, what is the problem? Just a little training will be needed.\" But it was simply impossible. He would say anything in front of the guests, in front of the neighbors. He would shout anything -- all kinds of obscene words.\nSo when the bishop came for his weekly visit, she told him her misery, \"What to do? I have purchased this parrot ... so beautiful.\"\nThe bishop said, \"Don't be worried. I have a very pious, saintly parrot, who continuously goes on moving his beads on the rosary, has the complete prayer and recites it so perfectly. I will take your parrot and keep this parrot with my parrot in the same cage.\nAnd he is such a saintly person he will teach this parrot.\" So he took the parrot.\nHe put the parrot in the same cage, and he went in. As he came out, he could not believe his eyes. The saintly parrot had dropped his rosary and was sitting very close to the other parrot. And the bishop said, \"What happened? Why have you dropped your rosary? And why are you not reciting Ave Maria or Alleluia?\"\nThe parrot said, \"I was praying for a woman, and I have got it. No more rosary, no more prayer. I have got such a beautiful girlfriend. You get lost!\"\nYour so-called saints and your so-called sinners are not much different -- only their masks are different. And my experience is that your sinners are more innocent than your saints. I have seen criminals, I have seen murderers. I used to visit the jails, and then I was finally jailed in America. I lived as an insider in\nfive jails, and I found such beautiful human beings, far more beautiful than the politicians, than the priests -- utterly innocent people.\nZen gives equal opportunity to sinners and saints, to the good and to the bad, because its understanding is very clear. Its insight is so deep that the distance from no-mind is equal.\nSo it does not matter what kind of things you have been involved in. Whether you were doing things which people think are wrong, or whether you were doing things which people think are right -- it does not matter! Those were all your mind phenomena. Just go beyond the mind. When the saint drops his mind, and the sinner drops his mind, they both enter into the same space, the same buddhahood.\nThis is the great rebellion of Zen. And this gives you a totally different kind of religiousness. This makes you dance, live with totality with no inhibition, with no guilt, because wherever you are, the moment you want to enter into your eternal life, you can take a jump. From any point in existence, from any kind of personality, you can drop that personality and move into utter silence.\nNo religion has that amount of guts; no religion has that amount of courage -- Zen is really daring! It belongs only to the lions, not to the sheep of Jesus Christ.\n\"THEY ARE ALL LIKE THE MOON REFLECTED IN WATER OR IMAGES IN THE\nMIRROR.\"\nIf a saint comes in front of a mirror, the mirror does not bother \"that you are a saint.\" A sinner comes -- the mirror makes no discrimination. The sinner is equal to the saint, to the idiot, to the so-called great scholar.\nThe mirror mirrors equally. The no-mind is your mirror.\nIn front of the mirror everyone is equal.\nZen gives you a totally new concept of spiritual communism. All religions are against communism, only Zen has the capacity to absorb communism.\nYou may be an atheist, it does not matter. You may be a theist, it does not matter.\nThe distance from no-mind is equal.\nSo I never ask you who you are. Whether you are an atheist, whether you are a theist -- it is your business. Whether you are a communist or an anarchist -- it is your business.\nWhether you are a Christian or a Hindu or a Mohammedan, it does not matter. What matters to me is whatever kind of mind you have make it the jumping board and jump into the no-mind. No-mind knows no differences, it is one cosmic whole. And to me, the man of no-mind is the only religious man. All else is just pseudo.\nHe is saying, \"THEY ARE ALL LIKE THE MOON REFLECTED IN WATER OR\nIMAGES IN THE MIRROR. HOW CAN WE SPEAK OF THEM AS BEING BORN\nOR AS PASSING AWAY?\"\nYou are never born, you have always been here. You have always been in the space, in the time, here and now; you will never die. Death and birth, are both superficial episodes in a long eternal life -- small things; they don't matter.\n\"WHEN YOU COME TO THIS UNDERSTANDING YOU WILL BE FURNISHED\nWITH ALL THE THINGS YOU ARE IN NEED OF.\"\nI have been telling you again and again that you don't need any morality, you don't need any discipline. But if you come to the no-mind, all that you ever needed will be furnished. You will become immensely compassionate. You will have the grace which is almost not of this world. You will have love without any conditions. You will share your joy, your blessings, to all and sundry -- not only to friends, but also to strangers. You will become just like a rain cloud which goes on showering without bothering whether it falls on the stones, or on the\nroad, or on the roof, or in the field, or in the garden. When you have abundance, who cares? You simply go on sharing. Anybody who is receptive will take it, who is not receptive will not take it. But that is not your problem.\nA buddha is choicelessly good. It is not that he is practicing a certain morality, following certain commandments. It is simply that he cannot do anything wrong. His consciousness, his light is so clear that he can see exactly what is good. He knows the good is a reward in itself, not that you will have a reward in heaven. And the bad is a punishment in itself, not that you will have a punishment in hell. So there is no heaven, no hell.\nEvery action brings its joy or its misery. A man with clear eyes can see. And I don't think anybody is going to choose misery, is going to choose pathology, is going to choose something ugly and obscene. If you have eyes, you will choose -\n- the most beautiful, the most glorious, the most majestic. It will come spontaneously.\nGyodai wrote a haiku:\nFOR MY SAKE,\nDO NOT LIGHT THE LAMP YET, THIS EVENING OF SPRING.\nThese small haikus are as beautiful as small dewdrops on the lotus leaves in the early morning sun. They shine more than diamonds, more than pearls.\n\"For my sake ...\" It is a beautiful evening of spring. Slowly, slowly the darkness is coming. The sun is setting, the birds are returning to their trees. The fragrance of the flowers is all around. The flowers of the night are opening their petals.\nDarkness has its own beauty; it is very clean, and it makes every separation disappear.\nEverything becomes one. Darkness has a depth which light misses. Darkness has a silence which light does not have.\nSo when the darkness is descending, and he can smell the night flowers opening, and the birds coming back to the trees making beautiful sounds, he says, \"For\nmy sake, do not light the lamp yet\" -- don't disturb this beautiful spring evening -\n- \"this evening of spring.\" Let me rest, let me watch this transformation from light into darkness.\nLight is very superficial, darkness has depth. Light comes and goes, darkness remains.\nYou don't have to bring it in; you can't push it out. You cannot do anything with darkness directly, you can do only something with the light. You bring the light in -- darkness disappears. You take the light out -- darkness comes in. In fact it never went anywhere; it was there, the light just covered it. When the light is gone, darkness is left.\nLight is momentary because it depends on fuel. And fuel -- even the fuel of the sun one day is going to be finished, because it is giving so much light, radiating every moment. It is becoming poorer every moment. Scientists think that it will take at least four million years for the sun to die. But in the eternity of existence, four million years don't matter.\nEvery day some suns are exhausted, become old, dead, finished. The physicists say they enter into black holes, they disappear. And every moment, as suns are disappearing, new suns are being born. Science has not yet discovered white holes. I think if there are black holes there must be white holes. If black holes pull stars and planets and they disappear, they die, then perhaps on the other side is a white hole from which after some time of rest\n-- maybe nine months in the womb -- they come out, again born.\nBut nothing in existence dies. Everything goes on, and everything gets tired. There is a moment to live and there is a moment to die. But your essential being simply goes from action to no-action. And again when it has gathered energy, it is rejuvenated, it becomes fresh; it comes back again from a new womb.\nOnly a buddha never comes back. His death is final because he has no desire left. It is the desiring mind that takes you into another womb. Buddha, a man who has realized his no-mind, is completely empty of desires, ambitions. Now there is no need for him to enter into another womb and suffer nine months in a prison. Then getting out of the prison is not a pleasure either. And the whole life again starts, the whole round. The same journey, the same youth, the same romances, the same failures, the same frustrations ... and the old age, and the fear\nof death.\nThe interest of Zen is how to help you to get rid of this circle of birth and death. The only way is going beyond the mind. It is the mind that contains all your ambitions, desires, tensions, anguishes, anxieties, angst. If you get out of it, you are the awakened one. You have come to the point from where you can move into the cosmos directly. You become part of the whole, or more accurately, you become the whole.\nQuestion 3 Maneesha's question:\nOUR BELOVED MASTER,\nIN HIS POEM, \"SONG OF MYSELF,\" WALT WHITMAN WRITES:\n\"YOU SHALL POSSESS THE GOOD OF THE EARTH AND SUN ... YOU SHALL\nNO LONGER TAKE THINGS AT SECOND OR THIRD HAND, NOR LOOK\nTHROUGH THE EYES OF THE DEAD, NOR FEED ON THE SPECTERS IN BOOKS\n.…\n\"THERE WAS NEVER ANY MORE INCEPTION THAN THERE IS NOW, NOR\nANY MORE YOUTH OR AGE THAN THERE IS NOW, AND THERE WILL NEVER\nBE ANY MORE PERFECTION THAN THERE IS NOW, NOR ANY MORE HEAVEN\nOR HELL THAN THERE IS NOW.\"\nBELOVED MASTER, FROM THE DEIFICATION OF A FICTION TO THE CELEBRATION OF ONE'S SELF -- IS THIS NOT THE ESSENTIAL\nDIFFERENCE\nBETWEEN THE OLD AND THE NEW MAN?\nManeesha, it is exactly the difference between the old man who lived under a slavery, and the new man who would have come out of the slavery of God, of churches, of religions.\nThe old man never really lived, he followed borrowed knowledge. He was always dictated to, dragged from this point to that point. The new man will live out of freedom, spontaneity, awareness. He will not have any scriptures, he will not have any dictators, he will not have any gods. He will be himself the ultimate consciousness. This is real growth.\nAnd it is time, the right time! We have lived in slavery enough. Now drop it ...in toto!\nMove into an open sky. Open your wings, the whole existence belongs to you.\nThe new man is going to be an emperor, in the sense that he will be the master himself.\nHe will not allow any other master. He will not allow any other slavery. He will not allow nations, he will not allow races, he will not allow caste systems. He will not allow all kinds of religions and their superstitions. The new man will be absolutely clean and fresh and innocent like a child. And out of that innocence arises a divine being, the buddha.\nThe buddha is the new man.\nIt is time for Sardar Gurudayal Singh. Put the light on!\nJerry and Judy Jam are sitting at breakfast one morning when Judy sighs and puts down her toast.\n\"Darling,\" she says, \"I have been thinking about that time when you were shipwrecked.\nAll the newspapers called you a hero because you survived alone in the Indian Ocean for three months on a life raft.\n\"And yet I feel, darling,\" continues Judy, \"that you have been hiding something from me ever since. What happened?\"\n\"Well, dear,\" replies Jerry, trying not to look like Mickey Mouse, \"since you have been so wonderful to me, I must confess I am hiding something from you! There was a lovely girl on that raft with me. We were on that ship together when it sank. We were the only ones that survived.\"\n\"A-ha!\" cries Judy.\n\"It was not like that, dear,\" explains Jerry. \"It is true, she was a prostitute, but she saved my life! We had no food, no water -- all we had was ourselves and our will to survive.\"\n\"I see,\" snaps Judy. \"So what did you do?\"\nJerry takes a long drink from his coffee cup and continues. \"You have to understand the conditions out there, dear. We had no food, no water. All we had was our own naked bodies.\"\n\"You have already told me that!\" interrupts Judy, sharply.\n\"We held each other tight,\" continues Jerry. \"All we had was our bodies -- naked under the burning sun.\"\nJudy does not say a word. She just stares at him as though he is a snake.\n\"All right! All right!\" cries Jerry, as he cracks under the strain. \"You want to know the truth? We fucked! Yes! We screwed all the time! If it had not been for that wonderful girl I would never have survived! Believe me -- she saved my life!\"\nSlowly, Judy pours herself another cup of coffee. \"I don't like it,\" she says. \"But I suppose I will have to live with it. But just one thing. Have you ever seen her again?\"\n\"Just once, dear,\" replies Jerry. \"I met her in Las Vegas last summer at our sales\nconvention.\"\n\"And what was she doing?\" snaps Judy, suspiciously. \"The same thing, dear,\" replies Jerry. \"Still saving lives!\"\nOn the Buckingham Palace lawn one afternoon, Prince Edward -- the rather dim son of Queen Elizabeth -- is sitting reading PLAYBOY magazine. He looks up at his brother, Prince Andrew, and asks, \"Hey, Andy, you've got brains: tell me -- what is a fox pass?\"\nAndrew thinks for a moment, and then says, \"Oh, you mean, faux pas! That's a French expression which means a social blunder.\"\nEdward looks at Andrew blankly. \"What do you mean, à social blunder'?\" asks the dim prince. \"Give me an example.\"\n\"Well,\" explains Prince Andrew, \"remember last Sunday when the Archbishop of Canterbury came to lunch, and mother took him for a walk in the rose garden?\"\n\"Yes, I remember,\" says Edward. \"What about it?\"\n\"Just listen,\" continues Andrew. \"Remember the archbishop pricked his thumb on a thorn? It was bleeding a lot, so mother brought him into the palace. They went into the bathroom together, and stayed there for a long time. And when they came out, we all went for lunch. Do you remember all that, Edward?\"\n\"Sure, I remember,\" replies Edward.\n\"Now,\" continues Andrew, \"do you remember, as I was just passing the pudding to you, mother said, Àrchbishop, is your prick still throbbing?' And then the archbishop replied,\n`No, Your Majesty, the swelling has gone down since you massaged it in the bathroom.'\n\"And then the pudding flew out of my hands and spattered all over everybody, and you shouted out, `Shit!' Do you remember all that?\"\n\"Yes, I remember!\" cries Edward, excitedly.\n\"Well,\" says Prince Andrew, \"when you shouted `shit' -- that was a faux pas!\"\nOne afternoon on the little Greek island of Crete, the local theatrical group is performing the famous Greek drama, \"Eat-a-Puss Rex.\" Young Spiro Sphincter, an amateur Greek actor, gets a small part in the play. He only has to come onto the stage, approach a beautiful girl lying on a bed, and say the words: \"I would love to kiss your lips and steal away!\"\nBut on the opening night Sphincter is really nervous. He comes onto the stage, his knees shaking, he stumbles over to the girl in the bed, and stutters, \"I would love to kiss your ...\nI would love to kiss your ...\" but his mind goes blank. He tries again.\n\"I would love to kiss your ...\"\nSuddenly, someone in the back jumps up and shouts out, \"Pussy!\"\nInstantly, Old Mrs. Acreepolis, sitting in the audience, has a severe stroke and falls over dead.\nThe next day at her funeral, in The Holy Orthodox Church of the Blessed Bleeding Virgin, Bishop Cretin, who has now got only three old ladies left in his flock, swears revenge!\n\"We have got to stamp out this kind of filth!\" cries Cretin. \"I am going to put a stop to this moral decay!\"\nSo that evening at the theater, Cretin is sitting at the side of the stage with a loaded shotgun on his knee and a stick of dynamite in his pocket, looking mean and menacing.\nSure enough, in the second act of the play, the young actor Sphincter comes bounding onto the stage, stumbles over to the girl in the bed, and announces, \"I am going to kiss your ... I am going to kiss your ...\" But again his mind goes blank.\nThere is a ripple of light laughter from the audience, and immediately Bishop\nCretin jumps to his feet and cocks his gun.\n\"All right, everybody,\" screams Cretin, \"I will blow the head off the first son-of- a-bitch who says `pussy'!\"\nNivedano ... (Drumbeat) (Gibberish) Nivedano ... (Drumbeat)\nBe silent, and close your eyes. Feel your bodies completely frozen. This is the right moment for turning inwards.\nGather all your energy, your total consciousness, and rush towards the center of your being which is just below the navel, inside. Two inches below the navel .…\nRush inside with an urgency as if this is the last moment of your life. Unless you have that urgency and intensity, you can never reach to the center.\nIt is not far away, it is very close; it only needs intensity and a deep feeling of urgency.\nFaster and faster ... Deeper and deeper ...\nAs you are coming closer to your center, a great silence descends over you like soft rain.\nYou can feel the coolness of it. A little more .…\nAnd suddenly you find immense peace arising from the very center of your being, surrounding you like incense.\nJust a little more ...\nAnd you will start feeling immensely calm, quiet, tranquil, blissful. Just one step and you are at the center. The moment you reach to the center you are almost drunk by the divine.\nYou disappear.\nIn place of you, there is sitting the image, the symbol of the Eastern awareness, enlightenment, Gautam the Buddha.\nIt is your very nature.\nEverybody is by his very birth a Gautam Buddha.\nVery few people go deep enough to recognize it; they remain outside their whole life.\nYou are the most fortunate people on the earth, who are trying to reach to your innermost nature.\nBeing the buddha simply means being alert, aware, conscious. It means you have become only a witness.\nThis word `witness' has to be remembered, because this is the only quality that buddha is made of.\nWitness that you are not the body; witness that you are not the mind -- this is the way to transcend body and mind.\nWitness, finally, that you are only a witness.\nThis is how one becomes a Gautam Buddha, the highest peak of consciousness ever achieved.\nA great ecstasy arises in you -- you have never known it before. You are feeling in tune with the universe; your heartbeat has become harmonious with the heartbeat of existence.\nTo make this witness deeper and more clear ...\nNivedano ... (Drumbeat)\nRelax ... but go on remembering only one thing -- that you are a witness, nothing else.\nThis is your transcendence.\nAnd as your witnessing deepens, you start melting into the universe as ice melts into the ocean.\nGautama the Buddha Auditorium is turning into an ocean of consciousness -- ten thousand buddhas have become one oceanic consciousness. We are separate on the periphery, but we are one at the center. The center is the center of everyone.\nAt this moment, rejoice ... and gather all those fragrances that are surrounding you -- the blissfulness, the ecstasy. Drink more and more from this eternal current of your life. And persuade the buddha to come with you -- he is your nature, he has to come with you. He has to become your very day-to-day life; he has to express his grace in your actions, in your words, in your silences of the heart.\nThat day, you will feel the most blessed person in existence when you disappear and only buddha remains.\nThese I have called the three steps of enlightenment:\nThe first step, the buddha comes behind you as a presence -- very solid, very tangible, you can feel it. You can feel its fragrance, you can feel its power; it fills you with great cheerfulness.\nThe second step, the buddha comes in front of you; you become the shadow. And slowly, slowly the shadow starts disappearing.\nThe third step, you are no more. Not even a shadow is left, only buddha remains\n-- a transparent consciousness, an eternal life. Those who come to this experience are the real people who can celebrate life.\nI celebrate myself.\nAnd I want you all to celebrate yourself. Become a dance, become a song.\nBecome a lotus, become a spring.\nThere is no religion and there is no God to prohibit you -- you are free from all superstitions, you are free from all God-oriented theologies, you are free from all rubbish that everybody in the world is carrying within himself. Throw it out so that your inner world is completely clean and ready to welcome the buddha.\nNivedano ... (Drumbeat)\nNow come back. But come back as a buddha, with the same grace, the same silence, the same peace, the same blissfulness. Sit down for a few moments just to recollect the golden path that you moved on, the immense opening that happened at your very center.\nYou found yourself so close to existence that it started flowing in you. Its dance became your dance; its celebration became your celebration. Its immensity, its grandeur, its splendor, became your splendor.\nAnd see, just behind you is the buddha, with all its transparency ... utter silence\n.…\nThis is the first step.\nSoon you will be able to take the second step. You will become the shadow, and buddha will become almost your very heart, your very heartbeat.\nAt the third and final step you will not be any more. You will be absent, and life will be present.\nThen begins the celebration.\nUnless life is a celebration you have lived in vain. Unless life turns into a Gautam Buddha you have been wasting a tremendous opportunity given to you by existence.\nOkay, Maneesha? Yes, Beloved Master.\nI Celebrate Myself: God Is No Where, Life Is Now Here Chapter #2\nChapter title: Ringing bells in your heart\n14 February 1989 pm in Gautam the Buddha Auditorium Archive\ncode:\n8902145\nShortTitle:\nCELEBR02\nAudio:\nYes Video:\nYes Length:\n174\nmins\nOUR BELOVED MASTER,\nWHEN DAITEN FIRST CAME TO SEKITO, THE MASTER ASKED HIM, \"WHAT\nIS YOUR NO-MIND?\"\nDAITEN REPLIED, \"THE ONE WHO SPEAKS IS IT.\" AT THIS, SEKITO SHOUTED, \"KWATZ!\" -- AND LEFT.\nTEN DAYS LATER, DAITEN AGAIN CAME TO SEKITO AND ASKED, \"THE\nLAST ANSWER I SAID TO YOU WAS NOT NO-MIND. WHAT IS NO- MIND?\"\nSEKITO SAID, \"WITHOUT RAISING EYEBROWS OR MOVING EYEBALLS, BRING YOUR NO-MIND HERE.\"\nDAITEN SAID, \"THERE IS NO NO-MIND TO BE BROUGHT.\"\nSEKITO SAID, \"BASICALLY, NO-MIND IS. WHY DO YOU SAY NO-MIND IS\nNOT? THAT IS THE WRONG STATEMENT.\"\nAT THIS, DAITEN WAS GREATLY ENLIGHTENED.\nFriends, first, a few questions. Question 1\nThe first question:\nTO US, ARE THE WORDS `GOD' AND `NO-MIND' SYNONYMOUS?\nNo, not at all. God can never be synonymous with no-mind. God is always there, far away. God has been always referred to by the word `that' -- invisible, just a fiction. No-mind has been always referred to as this.\nNo-mind is your reality, your ultimate nature; God was a mind-created lie. No- mind is your truth, your splendor, your very universe. They cannot be synonymous.\nGod does not exist; no-mind exists.\nGod is only a belief; no-mind is an experience. God has been the cause of all your mental sickness.\nNo-mind is pure health, wholeness.\nThe moment you utter the word `God' you immediately start thinking of him as a person, as a creator. No-mind is not a person; on the contrary, your very personality disappears, only then does no-mind start blossoming. No-mind is not a creator. It has always been here, and will remain always here; it is always now. No-mind is your eternity, your very source of life.\nGod was just an excuse to exploit humanity and to keep humanity in a very subtle and invisible bondage. God has been your prison; no-mind is your freedom. God has been in the hands of the priests, and the priests are doing the ugliest job in the world, because their whole business depends on a lie.\nNo-mind has no priests, it is simply there inside you. And once you experience it, suddenly you become aware that no-mind is not your property, it is not your monopoly.\nThe first experience appears to be that it is your no-mind, but soon you become aware that the no-mind contains the whole universe, it contains the whole existence.\nGod has always been an outsider. You cannot create anything if you are not an outsider.\nThe Hindus refer to God as a potter, but the potter has to be outside the pot, only then can he create it. If he is inside the pot, the pot is already created. What is he doing inside the pot? The potter has to be outside, only then can he create the pot. All religions have the same idea in different symbols -- but God is an outsider.\nIf there is a God you are only creatures, created people. Without God you are buddhas, uncreated people. God is the heaviest burden that man has been carrying, and because of that there is no progress, there is no evolution. The heavy burden, the chains, go on pulling you backwards. They don't allow you to\nmove faster to the higher peaks of evolution.\nGod has to be completely demolished from your minds. It is an absolute necessity and urgency. Once you drop God you will be surprised how many other lies have simply disappeared. He is the source, the foundation of all lies. Just watch God disappearing and you will see heaven has disappeared, hell has disappeared, fear has disappeared, dread, greed ... they are simply gone. God was the source. For the first time you can breathe at ease.\nGod was judgmental; no-mind has no judgment. God was continuously condemning you; no-mind is a blissful, ecstatic state. God is just programmed into your mind.\nIn the Soviet Union they program differently. They program no-God, but both are programs. The atheist does not know that there is no God, nor does the theist know that there is a God. Both are belief systems contrary to each other. But that does not mean that one is right and the other is wrong. Both cannot be right, but both can be wrong -- and both are wrong.\nAn authentic man will not accept any belief system either of atheist or of theist. He will explore on his own what the truth is; he will not like secondhand knowledge. You never think about it, but you would not like to wear somebody else's shoes. You would not like to wear somebody else's secondhand clothes. But your whole mind is secondhand, and not only secondhand, in fact, your mind has been going from hand to hand to hand for millions of years. Living with this mind is not living at all.\nYour mind is borrowed -- your life cannot be sincere and honest. Your mind is borrowed\n-- your morality cannot be truthful, it will only be hypocrisy. Out of a borrowed mind, how can you manage any truthfulness, any sincerity, any authenticity, any originality?\nGod is the oldest lie, and no-mind is a fresh original experience. God is no where; no-mind is now here.\nNo-mind is equivalent to life, is equivalent to existence. God is against life, God is against existence.\nCan't you see all the religions are against life? They don't want you to live. Anything that makes you joyous, anything that makes you really alive -- they start crushing it, condemning it as a sin.\nNo-mind simply allows you to be natural. It gives you an opportunity to be natural, to be relaxed, to be at ease -- no guilt, no inhibition, no suppression. Nature is accepted in its totality, it becomes your very heart, your very being.\nThere is no morality from outside. That outside God was creating all things from outside, imposing on you. And everybody around the world is carrying mountains of loads of beliefs, moralities, commandments. They are all inventions of the mind.\nNo-mind is not an invention of the mind, it is a discovery. You don't have to invent it, it is already here. You just have to be here also -- and the meeting, and the transformation.\nAnd out of that meeting and transformation arises a totally new kind of morality, a new kind of spontaneity, a new kind of natural grace, a new love for existence, a new reverence for all that is here, for all that surrounds you.\nBut everything that comes from your very innermost being is being prevented by your God, by your priests, by your scriptures. They are your enemies. You have to take it very clearly. Unless you understand who are the obstacles, you will never reach to no-mind.\nGod is the biggest obstacle to no-mind.\nBecause of God, the God-oriented religions could not manage any kind of meditation, because meditation goes inwards, and God is outside. And because God is outside, all the God-oriented religions have invented prayers.\nPrayers are for the outside God, and nobody has seen that God. A few people have pretended -- either they were lying or they were hallucinating, but nobody has seen God.\nIt is one of the most unproved hypotheses. Don't carry with you unproved hypotheses; they become very burdensome. As time passes they go on gathering more weight. The weight becomes so heavy that you stop growing. There is no space left for you to grow.\nAll kinds of rubbish, furniture, rotten ... surrounds you. You don't have any space to move.\nIf God is there you don't have any empty space, you don't have any empty sky. You don't have any possibility to evolve -- there is no space. Where are you going to evolve? God is filling every place. That's why religions insist that he is omnipresent. If he is omnipresent, then there is no space left for you. If he is all over, then wherever you go you will be struggling against God.\nNo-mind is a pure space. It simply gives you an opening which goes on widening as your experience becomes ripe. Finally, you find there is only pure space all around you, infinite and eternal -- and you can open your wings. It is your home -- you can fly as high as you want. There is no weight dragging you downwards, dragging you backwards. The experience of weightlessness is synonymous with no-mind.\nA strange Sufi story is .…\nA Sufi mystic was staying in a disciple's home. But he used to pray to God so loudly that the neighbors started complaining. In the middle of the night he would start shouting so loudly -- you have to shout loudly if you want to reach to an invisible God. You don't know where he is. Nobody knows his telephone number, nobody knows his address.\nBlindly, you are just raising your hands towards the sky, which never answers because there is nobody to answer.\nLooked at scientifically, people who are praying to God are absolutely insane, neurotics, because they are praying to somebody who is not there, and they are talking to somebody who has never been there. No answer ever comes.\nThat Sufi used to shout loudly. Finally, the disciple decided that it was better to keep him in the basement at night. So they arranged a bed in the basement of the house, so he could pray as loudly as he desired and nobody would be disturbed.\nBut in the middle of the night the whole neighborhood gathered, and they said, \"Why have you put him on the roof of your house?\"\nHe said, \"Roof? We have put him in the basement.\"\nBut they went up to the roof and he was there praying to God so loudly. And when you are praying from the roof, naturally your sound goes on waking all the neighbors.\nThe disciple asked, \"How did you manage to go to the roof?\"\nThe mystic said, \"I had to, because from the basement God will not hear me.\"\nMohammedans have great pillars around their mosque, high pillars they call minarets.\nAnd the priest goes to the high pillars, because if you pray from the high pillars there is a possibility God may hear you.\nHindus have in their temples -- Tibetans also have them in their temples -- different kinds of bells, gongs. Did you know their purpose is to attract the attention of God? So you give a good beat on the gong and God will listen to you. Then after giving the beat on the gong, or the drums, or the bells, you can pray.\nIn the Hindu temple the bell is where you enter. And the bigger the temple, the bigger the bell. The richer the temples, the bigger and bigger the bells ... deafening sound. First you have to ring the bell to wake up God for him to listen to you. But you don't know where he is. Your gong, your bells are just resounding in the empty sky. There is nobody to be wakened.\nNo-mind is a reality that you can experience, but for that no prayer is needed. You don't have to look outside of you. You have to close your eyes, and you have to look inwards without any idea of what you are going to find. If you have any idea that this is what you are going to find, then most probably you will imagine, and you will think you have found it.\nGo inwards without any prejudice, because all prejudices are part of the mind. Your Jesus, your Krishna, your Rama -- all are part of your mind. If you carry any prejudice with you, you remain confined to the mind. If you want to transcend the mind and reach to the no-mind, which is the ultimate consciousness, pure consciousness, the very essence of existence ... But for that, prayer is not of help, nor are temples of any help, nor are scriptures of any help.\nNo philosophy is needed, no system of beliefs is needed, no theology is needed.\nAll that you need is to unload yourself of everything that has been forced upon you.\nUnload yourself. Unburden yourself.\nDrop everything that has been given to you by your parents, by your teachers, by your priests, by your leaders.\nDrop everything that has come from outside. Throw it out!\nAnd suddenly you will find your mind is giving way into no-mind. You have only to drop the rubbish -- and God is part of the rubbish, the heaviest part.\nSo there is no possibility of God and no-mind being synonymous.\nHere, we are searching without any belief, without any hypothesis. We are simply going into our subjectivity, into our interiority.\nAs far as I am concerned, this is the only temple: your body. As far as I am concerned, your subjectivity -- silent, peaceful, just an empty space -- is the very source you have come from, and is the very goal you are going towards.\nWhen the source and the goal meet, you are enlightened -- the whole circle, the whole pilgrimage is complete. You have left the source as ignorant, you have come back to the source again as innocent. You have again become a child.\nOne birth is given by your parents, another birth you have to manage by yourself. The second birth is the birth which matters. The first birth is going to end up in death. The second birth is the beginning of eternity: no death, no end, no beginning.\nNo-mind is the whole universe, and it is not possible to find this no-mind by worshipping, by prayer, by believing. This mind needs you to be completely cured from all past-oriented ideologies, from all organized religions, from all scriptures, from all that has been forced upon you. It is phony, it is plastic.\nReal roses come on the bush from its interiority. You can hang plastic roses on the bush, but they will not be fragrant, and they will not be alive. And because they are not alive they are not going to die. They will just hang there. They are already dead; they are man-manufactured flowers.\nGod is a man-manufactured idea.\nNo-mind is not your idea. No-mind is not manufactured by man. No-mind is a gift of existence. You can only be grateful, you can only be in deep gratitude when you find no-mind. You will not find even a single word to say to existence. Even saying \"thank you\"\nwill look very superficial.\nIn the West it is very formal, you even say \"thank you\" to your mother, you thank your father -- not that you really mean it, it is just part of formality.\nIn the East it is totally different. I have never thanked my father, I have never thanked my mother. It is so superficial, it is so formal. When you love someone you cannot utter the words `thank you'. It will destroy the whole beauty of the experience.\nSo when you come to no-mind, you are utterly dumb.\nKabir has made a statement. He says the experience of no-mind is gunge keri sarkara --\nas if the dumb man has tasted the sugar. He cannot speak. He knows taste, but he is dumb; he cannot speak.\nThe experience of no-mind is inexpressible. You can have it, you can dance in celebration but you cannot say anything about it. Your dance certainly will shine with a new joy, with a new ecstasy, with a new drunkenness. Your dance will show a new radiation, a new aura around you. Your eyes will be shining. For the first time they have seen something worth seeing. Your whole being will be throbbing with joy, because you have come back to the original source.\nLet gods die. Don't carry on them. People are carrying dead gods, and when somebody is dead and you go on carrying him, you start stinking. All religious people stink because they are carrying a dead body.\nThere is a beautiful Hindu mythology .…\nShiva, one of the gods of the Hindus, one of the three gods, the trinity of Hinduism ...\nShiva's wife dies, but he won't accept the death of his wife. His mind was constantly telling him, \"If you go around the country there may be somebody who can resurrect her.\"\nHe used to live in the Himalayas, so he came down with the dead body of Parvati, his wife. The very word parvati means daughter of the mountains ... a beautiful woman, but dead. He carried the corpse around the country, asking everybody, \"Is there any physician, any man of miracles?\"\nThe body was deteriorating, and soon it started falling into pieces. The legs dropped in one place, the hands dropped into another place ... Hindus have twelve holy places. Those twelve holy places in the country are the twelve places where Parvati's parts dropped. But even though parts were dropping, Shiva continued around the country until he found that the last part had dropped. It must have taken him years.\nBut your carrying a dead God is a longer pilgrimage -- millions of years. And you go on believing that someday, somewhere, God will materialize. Meanwhile you go on carrying the corpse. The corpse is destroying you also, because it is rotten, and it is making a rotten humanity.\nGod is a sickness; you have simply to drop it. But the only good thing is that you are carrying the sickness, so you can drop it. It is your belief, so you can throw it out! It is not something that is a part of you, it is something that you are holding unnecessarily. It is not holding you! This is the only beautiful thing about it -- that you can drop God.\nOne day I dropped God, and since then I have felt so weightless, so blissful. I used to carry the dead body myself, but I realized that the body was dead -- no breathing, no heartbeat -- it was up to me whether to carry it or drop it. And as I dropped it, for the first time I felt myself as an individual. The dead body was overwhelming me, it was covering me from all the sides. It had become my personality.\nFor a moment I felt naked, because the personality had dropped, the masks had\ndropped.\nBut soon I knew that this nudity, this nakedness was natural. Everybody is nude behind the clothes. The moment you drop your clothes ... Have you ever felt a certain freedom just on the seabeach as you drop your clothes? You suddenly feel the sun with your body, the wind blowing on your body, and a tremendous sense of freedom -- just by dropping clothes, which are not of much weight.\nGod is very heavy. It goes on becoming heavier and heavier as time passes. A moment comes when it is heavier than you -- you are crushed under the mountainous load. Unless one is free from God, one knows not what freedom is.\nSo God cannot be synonymous with no-mind.\nNo-mind is really the antidote to the disease called God. No-mind is your freedom.\nAll chains dropped, all thoughts dropped, all feelings dropped ... suddenly you find only the purest essence has remained. All that was covering it, layer upon layer, has been dropped. This dropping I call meditation.\nFinally only a witness, a sakshi, remains -- just a pure awareness. This is ultimate freedom, and the authentic religion is for ultimate freedom and ultimate liberation.\nGod-oriented religions cannot even give you a sense of freedom, or a direction for freedom. Their whole effort is to direct your mind towards God. Fill your mind with God, repeat his name again and again so it becomes ingrained in your mind. The more ingrained it becomes, the more difficult it will be to leave it. The sooner you leave God, the better. And you will have to leave one day, so why not now! One cannot live a lie forever. Only truth can be lived forever.\nYou have to believe only in lies, you don't have to believe in the truth. Truth has to be discovered. I teach you purely the attitude of an agnostic -- one who does not believe, who does not disbelieve, but who is a seeker, a searcher, an explorer.\nCertainly the first thing to be explored is your own inner being. That is the closest life throbbing, everything else is a little far away. The man of intelligence first will look inside his own house before he goes searching on the moon and on\nMars. First he will look inside to see what is there. And those who have gone inside have never come empty handed. They have come with so much bliss, so much ecstasy, with such an abundance that they start sharing, because as they share they come to understand the inner economics.\nThe more you share the more you have. If you don't share, you won't have even that which you had. Jesus says, \"Those who have shall be given more, and those who have not, even whatsoever they have will be taken away.\" I cannot agree with him. I say unto you, the more you give, the more you will have; the less you give, the less you will have.\nIf you don't give at all, you won't have anything left. Sharing is the only compassion.\nSharing is the only service.\nSharing is the only way the awakened one lives. That is real character. That is authentic morality. That is true religiousness.\nYou don't have a God, but you become godly. Hence I say, the moment you drop God you are moving in the right direction of becoming godly. You will be divine in your ecstasies, in your silent spaces of the being. You will be divine. But you will be divine because you will be participating in the divine existence. Everything is sacred to the man who has come to know himself, who has discovered his hidden secret of life. Everything becomes sacred.\nA story is told about the mystic Nanak .…\nHe went to Kaaba, the holy place of the Mohammedans. It is a beautiful story.\nHe reached Kaaba by the evening, but his fame had already reached, so people were waiting for him. They received him, welcomed him, but he was very tired. So he said, \"I would like to go to sleep, I have been walking miles and miles.\"\nSo they prepared a bed under a tree, but he turned the bed. Mohammedans don't sleep with their legs towards Kaaba, but he turned the bed so that his legs were towards Kaaba, and his head was on the opposite side.\nWhen the head priest of Kaaba heard about it, he came running. He said, \"We\nthought you were a great mystic, but you don't even seem to be religious. You don't understand that you are hurting our feelings. You are keeping your feet towards the most divine and the most holy land! You should turn your feet.\"\nNanak laughed. He said, \"As far as I am concerned, wherever I turn my feet I find they are towards the holy land, because to me the whole existence is holy. Now if you think there is some place which is unholy, please turn my legs. I am willing!\"\nThere was a silence. The priest could not say that there was some place that was unholy.\nBut this could not be tolerated either, that this man continued to keep his feet towards Kaaba.\nI think up to this point it is factual. Beyond this point it becomes more and more symbolic. But even that is significant .…\nFinally, the priest decided to turn his legs and turn his head towards Kaaba. But they were utterly disappointed, surprised. They could not believe their eyes. Wherever they moved Nanak's legs, Kaaba moved.\nThis must be symbolic, but it is significant. It is poetry, but it gives you the feeling that if everything is holy and sacred it does not matter where you keep your legs it will always be towards the sacred land. The whole existence is sacred for a mystic. Nanak showed his understanding very clearly. Only a man of no-mind can do that.\nA man of no-mind knows that everywhere life is throbbing -- in the trees, in the rivers, in the mountains ... Even the Himalayas are still growing. It is the youngest mountain in the whole world, but really powerful because it has got the highest peaks in the world and they are still growing -- one foot per year. But that means it is alive, it is not a dead mountain. It is reaching towards the stars, perhaps very slowly because it is not a small mountain. And for mountains, even to rise one foot in one year is quite fast. Looking at eternity, if the Himalayas go on growing in this way, soon they will be touching stars; it won't be long.\nWhen you see life everywhere, in the stones -- perhaps fast asleep so that you cannot feel it, perhaps a different dimension -- in the trees, so that you cannot understand it ... But everything is so abundantly alive, all that you need is space\nand perceptivity of no-mind.\nGod is your blindness. No-mind is going to give you fresh eyes to look again at the universe.\nQuestion 2\nThe second question:\nNIETZSCHE MADE THE OBSERVATION THAT WHEN \"ORDINARY PEOPLE\"\nARE IN AN UNPLEASANT SITUATION, \"THEY ALWAYS SEEK TO GET OUT OF\nIT WITH THE SMALLEST EXPENDITURE OF INTELLIGENCE.\"\nIS GOD SIMPLY THE FIRST AND LAST RESORT OF A RETARDED HUMANITY?\nYes, absolutely yes. God is the invention of the retarded, of the idiots, of the imbeciles, of the people who want a shortcut so they don't have to exert any intelligence. God is the belief of the unintelligent. God is the belief of the unconscious. God is the belief of those who are still asleep and dreaming. The moment you wake up, all dreams disappear, and with the dreams your God will also disappear.\nNo-mind is waking up from the sleep of the mind. No-mind is a sunrise.\nMind has been a long long dark night, and no-mind blossoms into tremendous intelligence, not intellect. Intellect is part of the mind, intelligence is part of no- mind. It is a totally different phenomenon. And when that fire of intelligence rises in you in great flames, you don't find any God anywhere, but you certainly find everything is sacred because everything is alive.\nSo a great reverence for life -- that's what I teach you. But you will know life only when you have touched your own life. Then you will know the criterion for what is alive. Right now you don't know the criterion for what is alive.\nQuestion 3\nThe third question:\nTHROUGH MY OWN RECENT ENCOUNTER WITH DEATH, I CAME ACROSS\nMANY STORIES OF PEOPLE FROM DIVERSE CULTURES AND OF DIFFERENT\nRELIGIOUS BACKGROUNDS, WHO TEMPORARILY LEFT THEIR BODIES AND\nAPPEARED TO OBSERVERS TO BE DEAD. THEY REPORTED SEEING A \"BEING\nOF LIGHT,\" WHICH WAS TOTALLY LOVING AND COMPASSIONATE.\nCOULD THIS \"BEING OF LIGHT\" BE THE BASIS ON WHICH THE CONCEPT OF\nGOD HAS BEEN CREATED?\nNo, not at all. This experience is authentic. It happens sometimes to people who have almost died -- not completely, but almost. They see a luminous being. It is their own being, it is not God. In meditation you will encounter the same luminous being without dying.\nMeditation is a kind of death. You are separated from the body, you are separated from the mind -- that's what death does. You are separated from the body, you are separated from the mind. Suddenly you become aware of a luminous being, which you think is separate from you because you have never seen such an experience before. If you have been a meditator, you would have recognized -- \"This is me.\"\nYou are a light, luminous body inside this body -- a flame, an eternal flame of light. But those who have almost died and come back to life, because they don't have any experience of meditation, they think they have seen something, a luminous being. They remember it vaguely, faintly, a faraway echo, but they remember it. They have seen something luminous. Naturally they cannot\nconceive that they have seen themselves.\nGod is not based on the experience of people who were almost dead and have come back again to life. But meditation knows exactly what has been happening to these people --\nthey have encountered themselves. But because the encounter was for the first time, and so quick ... just like a flash it came and went away, and they were back to life. Naturally they think they have seen some object, some person standing there with a radiant, luminous body, because they have known only objects in their lives. They have never known the subject.\nA meditator will not commit such a mistake. A meditator will recognize immediately --\nwhether alive or dead -- that he is the luminous eternal light. The sutra:\nOUR BELOVED MASTER,\nWHEN DAITEN FIRST CAME TO SEKITO, THE MASTER ASKED HIM, \"WHAT\nIS YOUR NO-MIND?\"\nDAITEN REPLIED, \"THE ONE WHO SPEAKS IS IT.\" AT THIS, SEKITO SHOUTED \"KWATZ!\" -- AND LEFT.\nDaiten is not yet enlightened, but he must have been a great scholar. He has read in the scriptures that the no-mind is the one from where all that is original comes out. When a buddha speaks, he is not speaking borrowed words. His speaking is coming from no-mind. No-mind is flowing in his words, hence the beauty.\nThe same ordinary words on the lips of a buddha certainly become magical, alive. Very ordinary words suddenly take a totally different flavor, a new fragrance. They start being poetic. They have around them a certain aura. That's why the words of a buddha start ringing bells in your heart.\nHe is not speaking strange words. You know those words, you use those words. But when a buddha speaks those same words, because they are coming from no- mind, they carry some space around them that makes the awakened one's words so authoritative. The awakened one is not authoritative. He does not command you, he does not give quotations from the scriptures to support as an evidence. He is his own authority.\nI have been telling stories, and people who don't understand me have sometimes written,\n\"Your stories go on changing. Sometimes you say something, sometimes your story completely changes ...\" They are only listening to the mere words, not to me. They are blind people, they cannot see that my story is a response to the people to whom I am talking. In the present moment it takes a new shape, a new meaning, a new dimension.\nMy stories go on changing because life goes on changing. What can I do about it?\nSometimes it is spring and there are flowers all over, and sometimes it is not spring and the trees are standing naked without any leaves. What can I do? Life goes on changing.\nMy stories are not dead, they are as alive as I am alive. They are coming from a living source.\nAnd they have told me -- great scholars and professors, linguists, those belonging to different religions -- \"I like your story but it is not in the scriptures at all.\" I said, \"Then you should put it in. Your scripture is not growing, it is dead. If you like the story, if you felt there was some meaning, then put it in your scripture.\"\nBuddha is not the end of the world. There are going to be buddhas after Gautam Buddha.\nThere will be buddhas after me, after you, and certainly they are going to continuously improve. It is not an effort, it is a spontaneous phenomenon.\nWhen I start the story I don't know what shape it is going to take. I am as much surprised as you are -- \"My God! This story is not the story I have heard before.\"\nBut what can I do? It is not my mind. Mind has a memory system, so it goes on repeating the same gramophone record, and gets stuck at the same point each time. If it is an ancient gramophone record, the needle goes on stopping at the same place. You start again; again it will stop at the same place.\nOnce I was participating as a student in an inter-university competition for eloquence. I was the first one to speak, and the second person came from the Sanskrit University of Varanasi. It is devoted completely to Sanskrit scriptures and language. But the student must have been feeling a little inferior to the other students who came from different universities, because in the Sanskrit University they don't teach English. So he must have crammed one statement in English of Bertrand Russell, just to make an impression.\nBut he was nervous. As he started, after three or four lines, he said, \"Bertrand Russell has said ...\" -- in English -- and then he stopped. His mind went blank. I was just sitting by his side because he was the second person to speak. The whole auditorium was full of students and professors, and there was a great silence when he stopped. I thought I should help him, so I told him, \"Repeat again.\"\nAnd when you have crammed something, you can repeat it only from the very beginning.\nSo he said, \"Sisters and brothers ...\" So the whole audience started laughing. He again repeated those three or four sentences and came to the point, \"Bertrand Russell has said\n...\" -- and a fullpoint.\nI said, \"Repeat!\" Finding no way out, he again started, \"Brothers and sisters ...\"\nAnd it was such a joy -- for ten minutes it continued. I would say, \"Repeat,\" and finding no way out ... and I was the only help. Everybody was laughing. And he would say,\n\"Sisters and brothers ...\" -- and finished! Everybody was waiting for these three sentences, \"Bertrand Russell has said ...\" -- fullpoint.\nAfter ten minutes, the chairman, the vice-chancellor of the university, himself was laughing, and he told the boy, \"Just sit down. Don't be worried, everything is\nokay. Just sit down\" -- he was perspiring. And the chancellor said to me, \"You should not have done this.\"\nI said, \"I was simply helping him. I never thought that he was a gramophone record. I thought some time he may slip ahead -- `Bertrand Russell has said ...' But he proved to be a gramophone record, broken. It was not my fault. And anyway, he gave such a joyous evening. Even if you give him the first prize, I am ready, because he has given so much joy, nobody can give.\"\nNow scientists have found that your memory system functions exactly like the gramophone record. They have opened the brain for other reasons, but somehow they found that if they put an electrode on the memory point in your brain, you start saying something. And if they take the electrode away, you stop and your brain automatically reverses. Again when they put the electrode back, you start from \"Brothers and sisters\" --\nagain the same. Take the electrode off, and you stop.\nThey have discovered that the mind has an automatic reverse system -- once you have stopped, it goes back to its original place. You touch that spot again and the person starts saying the same thing. There is no reason why he is speaking -- nobody has asked anything. But he is helpless -- the memory starts repeating like a record.\nDaiten must have been a scholar. He has quoted this sentence, not from his own experience but from scriptures.\nWhat is he saying? When Sekito asked him, \"WHAT IS YOUR NO-MIND?\" DAITEN REPLIED, \"THE ONE WHO SPEAKS IS IT.\" One who speaks\noriginally. If one speaks only that which is borrowed, it is from the mind. But if\none speaks originally, spontaneously, then it is coming from the space called no- mind. But he forgot the word òriginally'. That happens to scholars; it cannot happen to a buddha. Whatever is coming, is coming from the very source. But when you are repeating a scripture which is not your experience, there is going to be some difficulty.\nIf he had said, \"The one who speaks spontaneously -- that is the place of no- mind ...\" He has forgotten that one word òriginal', and perhaps it was not written in the scripture itself, because no buddha has written a single word. All\nscriptures have been compiled by their disciples, sometimes after the death. Sometimes hundreds of years have passed and then disciples of disciples ... generations have passed.\nThe four gospels of Jesus are recorded after his death, and not immediately, three hundred years afterwards. Now nobody was a witness; all the witnesses were dead. And these gospels were recorded by people who had not seen Jesus. They had not even seen Jerusalem. Now biblical research scholars have found that even the geography that they have mentioned in the four gospels is wrong. These people have never been to Israel.\nThey have heard from others, who have heard from others, who have heard from others.\nThat's why I have spoken on Thomas's gospel which was written in India. He was a direct disciple of Jesus, but his gospel is not included in the Holy Bible. It was discovered just thirty years ago, but it is the most beautiful because at least Thomas was a witness. And it has tremendous beauty because it is not only that he was a witness to Jesus, here in India he went through a transformation.\nHe meditated, he practiced yoga, he lived like a sannyasin and moved from monastery to monastery. Buddha's air was still there. Buddha was gone five hundred years before that, but his fragrance was still alive. So in his gospel there is a certain authority which is lacking in the four gospels of the Bible. First he was a witness, he had heard Jesus, and secondly he himself had experienced the truth. The combination of both, gives a greater authority to the fifth gospel of Thomas than The Holy Bible.\nThomas is the only man in the whole world whose body has not deteriorated. His body is still in a church in Goa. Every year at Christmas time, his body is brought out of the church and his coffin is opened for any observer, for any scientist, for any researcher.\nNobody has been able to figure out why it looks so fresh, as if he had died just now.\nThere seems to have been no device used. It is not kept in a freezing temperature, it is in a hot country, but even the skin does not look as if it is dead. He looks so fresh. I have been to see the body.\nJesus' miracles may have been a myth, but this man really managed a miracle. After two thousand years he is the only person around the world whose body looks as if it has died just now -- or perhaps he is fast asleep. No smell, and if it can remain for two thousand years; there is no problem for it to remain forever. Care has to be taken that nobody disturbs it.\nThere have been efforts to disturb it by Hindus, by Mohammedans, by people who are not Christians, because it is a great argument in favor of Christianity. But the man Thomas was not a Christian, he never knew about Christianity. He came just after Jesus was crucified. He left Jerusalem for the simple reason that Jesus must have told his close friends -- and Thomas was one of those who was very close to him -- about India, and about the universities of Nalanda and Takshashila, and about meditation.\nSo now that Jesus was crucified, he saw there was no point in being there, and he left. He came by ship, so he landed in South India. But he traveled all over India, and met all kinds of mystics who were deeply rooted in meditation. His body is a proof that he must have followed a certain method which was known to the Tibetan lamas, to the Ladakh people.\nThey used to use a certain method of meditation when the meditator was dying\n... at the last moment, a certain process called Bardo. It was nothing but a post- hypnotic suggestion. When a man is dying, he is in a very vulnerable state. And if he has been a meditator, then he is perfectly awake. Death is coming, but he is perfectly awake. He can be hypnotized and told, \"When you leave your body, the body will remain intact as it is\n...\" You have to continue repeating so that it enters, not only into his mind, it enters even into his bones, into his marrow, into his blood.\nBardo is a very intensive hypnosis, and it is also possible to give directions for the future to the soul that is leaving the body. Both can be done. The body can be preserved by post-hypnotic suggestion. But you cannot do it if the man has died. Then there is nobody to listen to the post-hypnotic suggestion. The man has to be alive, just on the verge of death.\nYou give him the post-hypnotic suggestion: \"Your body will remain intact, will remain intact ... you go on.\" And if he is a meditator, even the bones, the blood, the body starts listening. The soul will leave but the body will remain completely\nas the soul has left it.\nThis was one way that Bardo was used for the body.\nAnd there was a second way. You can give suggestions to the leaving soul as to what kind of womb will be good -- \"Choose rightly. Don't be accidental.\" Millions of people are making love, and millions of people are dying. So those souls are roaming around, finding a couple who is making love. This is accidental. Because they die unconsciously, they unconsciously grope in the darkness, and whoever comes close by, just by chance they enter into that womb.\nBardo prevents the accidental. It gives the soul a right direction: \"You need a certain kind of womb, so don't be in a hurry. You have been a meditator, and you have to find a mother, a father, who will allow you to meditate -- not only allow you to meditate but who will help you to meditate, who are themselves meditators. So don't be in a hurry!\nChoose a couple.\"\nSometimes the man of meditation takes time to find the right womb; ordinary persons immediately enter into the womb. Bardo gives two kinds of possibilities: the body can be kept, and the soul can be given a sense of direction where to go. But this is possible only if the man has been deeply into meditation, has been practicing meditation for a long time, and was capable of remaining conscious when death comes, because death is the greatest operation.\nNature has managed it so that nobody should die consciously, just as a surgeon will not be ready to operate on you if you are conscious. First he will give you chloroform or something that makes you unconscious. Then he can operate on you because you don't know what is happening. You are so deeply asleep that things can be removed from your body, bones can be cut, replaced, anything can be done.\nDeath is the greatest operation, because the whole seventy years' attachment to the body has to be broken. Nature has managed -- this is the wisdom of nature, the intelligence of nature -- that a person who is not capable of detachment with the body, who does not know that \"I am not the body,\" should be made unconscious. Otherwise he will be passing through tremendous anguish and anxiety.\nSo it is natural wisdom, but it is not applicable to the meditator. The meditator can afford to die consciously without any pain, without any anguish, without any anxiety.\nDAITEN REPLIED, \"THE ONE WHO SPEAKS IS IT.\" AT THIS, SEKITO SHOUTED, \"KWATZ!\" -- AND LEFT.\nThis shout says to Daiten, \"Shut up! It is not you, it is borrowed. I can see the deadness of your statement.\" Shouting \"Kwatz!\" is saying \"Shut up!\" And then he left immediately, because there was no point in wasting time with this man, he was just a dead scholar.\nTEN DAYS LATER, DAITEN AGAIN CAME TO SEKITO AND ASKED, \"THE\nLAST ANSWER I SAID TO YOU WAS NOT NO-MIND.\"\nHe realized. He was sincere, at least, honest.\nFirst he had tried to deceive Sekito -- you cannot deceive a master, that is impossible. He looks through and through you. He knows from where the answer is coming: from the mind or from the no-mind. It is so clear to a master from where the answer is coming.\nAny answer from the mind -- \"Kwatz! Shut up!\"\nHe must have thought about it: \"Why did the master behave in such a hard way? And I was a stranger, a new person. Certainly there must be some reason why he behaved without any compassion. I must be wrong.\" And then in ten days' meditation he understood, \"What I said was only a repetition of scriptures.\" So he came back.\nTEN DAYS LATER, DAITEN AGAIN CAME TO SEKITO AND ASKED, \"THE\nLAST ANSWER I SAID TO YOU WAS NOT NO-MIND. WHAT IS NO- MIND?\nPlease tell me. I don't know.\"\nAn authentic seeker begins with \"I don't know, because all that I know is not mine. It does matter. I may have much knowledge, but as far as I am concerned, I don't know.\"\nThis acceptance is the beginning of the search. If you know already, there is no need to search, there is no need to seek.\nSEKITO SAID, \"WITHOUT RAISING EYEBROWS OR MOVING EYEBALLS, BRING YOUR NO-MIND HERE.\"\nStrange, but masters are strange people. They have their own ways of pushing you into the unknown territory of your own being.\nSEKITO SAID, \"WITHOUT RAISING EYEBROWS OR MOVING EYEBALLS, BRING YOUR NO-MIND HERE.\"\nDAITEN SAID, \"THERE IS NO NO-MIND TO BE BROUGHT. In the first\nplace, I don't know what no-mind is. In the second place, if it is no-mind how can you bring it? It is not a thing. It is not even a thought, it is pure awareness. It cannot be brought here as an object for your observation.\"\nSEKITO SAID, \"BASICALLY, NO-MIND IS.\" You cannot bring it -- I can understand.\nIt is not a thing, it is not a thought, it is only pure isness, thisness, suchness. \"BASICALLY, NO-MIND IS. WHY DO YOU SAY NO-MIND IS NOT?\" It is\nthe only isness in existence. Because you cannot bring it, you think, \"It is not.\nThat's why I cannot bring it.\" You cannot bring it because no-mind is the whole universe. How can you bring it? It is already here.\nThis very moment it is here, as it was in front of Sekito.\n\"WHY DO YOU SAY NO-MIND IS NOT? THAT IS THE WRONG STATEMENT.\"\nJust say I don't know. Say no-mind is not a thing, not a thought, hence it cannot be brought. But don't say no-mind is not. No-mind only is -- pure is.\nAT THIS, DAITEN WAS GREATLY ENLIGHTENED -- hearing this statement,\nthat all that is, is no-mind. Isness and no-mind are two names of the same thing. This presence of life in the trees, in the stones, in people, in birds ... this vast isness, this presence is no-mind. You don't have to bring it here, it is already here. You cannot take it anywhere else.\nAs far as time is concerned, it is now. As far as space is concerned, it is here.\nIf you are silent, you will immediately become aware of it.\nThis statement made such a deep penetration into Daiten, he was greatly enlightened.\nAn authentic seeker, sincere seeker, who does not hide himself behind false knowledge, borrowed knowledge, who does not pretend that he knows without knowing, if he accepts\n\"I don't know\" -- he is already very close to the truth. He has accepted his innocence now there is no barrier. No God, no scripture, no knowledge -- he is just as close as one can be to no-mind. A little push by the master, a little statement, and he will be drowned into existence. That drowning into existence is enlightenment. Disappearing into existence is enlightenment.\nI have always loved one story from China .…\nThe emperor of China was a great painter. At his seventy-fifth birthday, he was feeling old, and perhaps the day was not far away when he would have to leave the body. So he arranged a great competition before he would leave the body: a competition for painting throughout China.\nFirst, in every state there would be a competition, and one painting would be chosen.\nThen the final would be in the capital, and the emperor would choose which was the greatest painting. He himself was a competitor. He had painted a beautiful painting.\nAll the painters came from all over China. They all brought their great canvases that they had done. Only one man came without any painting, just paint and a\nbrush -- strange fellow!\nThe emperor asked, \"Where is the painting?\"\nHe said, \"I don't like old things. I will paint freshly here and now. You have to give me a room, because I don't paint on canvas, I paint on the walls. Give me the biggest room in your palace and don't disturb me. And keep a guard so that nobody disturbs me. I don't know how long it will take, because it is going to be a spontaneous thing. I don't know what I am going to paint. I am just going to paint out of spontaneity, whatever happens, however long it takes.\"\nThe king said, \"I am getting old, that's why I have arranged this competition. You have to be quick and fast.\"\nHe said, \"No. I don't know. It may be quick. Tomorrow morning I may inform you that the painting is complete, or it may take longer. I cannot promise.\"\nNo man of understanding can ever promise anybody, because who knows about the next moment? All promising is in ignorance.\nThe king said, \"You are a difficult person, but I can see in your eyes, and I can see in your face -- perhaps you will be the greatest painter.\" So he gave him the biggest room in the palace -- and there were many big rooms -- with a plain wall so he could paint, and he closed the doors.\nThe painter said, \"Nobody should enter, not even you, until the painting is complete. I will come out for food or anything I need.\" And he kept a curtain also so that even the guards could not have a look inside at what was happening behind the curtain.\nIt took three years for him, and the king was saying, \"What are you doing? I may never be able to see your painting, I may die!\"\nThe painter said, \"It does not matter. If you die you die. If you are alive you will be able to see it. But I cannot do anything in a hurry.\"\nThe emperor had to wait.\nFour years passed and the painter came out one morning and said to the emperor, \"The painting is complete. You are welcome.\"\nSuch curiosity had arisen in the emperor's mind. For four years, he was thinking, \"What is that guy painting?\" He himself was a painter. It did not take four years for one painting.\nAnd when he came the emperor immediately followed him. They went behind the curtain.\nThe painting was just unbelievable; it looked so real. He had painted a huge forest, so green, lush green, almost three-dimensional. And a small path was going -- you could see the path was going and going ... and then it disappeared into the thickness of the jungle.\nAnd the emperor said, \"Where does this path go?\"\nThe painter said, \"Let us ... Come with me. We can walk and see where the path goes, because without experience you will not know where it goes.\"\nThe story is, both went into the path -- the guards were watching -- and as the path turned around, they both turned around and since then nothing has been heard.\nThis story -- in a painting you cannot enter -- is a symbolic story. It says you can enter in the isness of things. The painter has made the painting so alive that branches were moving in the wind. The path was no ordinary path, and the symbolic meaning is: if you cannot enter into a painting, the painting is not worth calling a painting. But entering does not mean physical entry. Entering means you get lost completely: you are no more, only the painting is.\nThat's how you enter into meditation -- you are no more. You come across a tremendous isness; everything disappears, you disappear, yet that isness remains. That experience of isness is enlightenment. This story simply gives a symbolic representation of enlightenment.\nA painter is not worth the salt if he himself cannot disappear into his own painting.\nPicasso is reported to have said, \"When I am painting, I am no more, only the painting is.\"\nNijinsky has said many times in his life -- because he was asked again and again\n--\n\"When I am dancing I am no more. As long as I am, the dance is superficial. When only dancing remains and I am no more, then it has a tremendous quality.\" It was observed by scientists, and they could see the tremendous quality. Whenever he forgot himself completely in dancing he used to jump higher than gravitation allows. Scientists were simply at a loss how to figure it out, because that much of a jump was not possible.\nAnd even more miraculous was his coming back Gravitation pulls everything\nso fast.\nYou see every night -- you think stars are falling. All around the earth six thousand stars fall every day on the earth. They are not stars, stars are very big, a thousand times, a million times bigger than the earth. If one star falls, we are finished. Those are not stars, those are small stones which have been left hanging in space.\nWhen the moon separated from the earth -- once it was part of the earth You\nhave all these great oceans, the great Indian Ocean, and the Pacific, and the Atlantic. All these oceans are created because the mud and the stones and everything from these places fell out, because the earth was liquid -- in the beginning it was liquid. The moon is just the combination of that whole lot that has fallen out of the earth. But it created great oceans -\n- the Pacific is five miles deep.\nBut when such great lumps fell out, many small pieces also fell out. Those small pieces are just floating in space, millions of pieces of stone of different sizes. The earth's gravitation pulls these stones downwards, and at the point where the atmosphere begins, it is two hundred miles deep. Around the earth there is a thickness of two hundred miles of atmosphere, because up to that point there is air. Beyond that there is no air; it is pure space, even air is not existent. Sometimes those small stones -- and there are a few big stones also ...\nThe stone in the Mohammedans' holy place that they worship, Kaaba, is also one of the stones that has fallen from outer space, but it is a very huge stone. In every museum you can find stones which have reached to the earth.\nBut what happens when they enter the earth's atmosphere by chance? Gravitation\npulls them so fast that the friction with the air makes them turn into a fiery stone, a fire. That is why you can see them up to a point, and then suddenly they disappear. If the stone was small, then it would come to a certain point and it would be burned out. The force of gravitation is such that only very big stones can come up to the earth, otherwise they disappear in the air somewhere.\nNijinsky's coming back was absolutely against gravitation. He came just as a feather comes slowly -- so slow was his movement coming back. Both the things were against gravitation: first his jump, and then his coming like a feather as if he had no weight; gravitation cannot work on it.\nAnd he was asked about it again and again. He said, \"I have tried, but whenever I try, it does not happen so I cannot say anything about it. When I am not, when I get completely disappointed and forget all about it, that one day suddenly it happens. When I am not trying to do it, it happens. I am not, only the dance is. When I am not, only the dance is.\"\nNijinsky perhaps was the greatest dancer in the world.\nBut this is the misfortune -- that these people were born in the West. They had no idea that they were so close to no-mind. They needed a master just to give them a little push.\nNijinsky would have been a Gautam Buddha, and Picasso would have been a Gautam Buddha. They have come so close. But the West has no idea how to go ahead, how to go into the painting.\nJust move on on the road and get lost. That will be your great experience -- when you are lost. When you are no more, only existence is.\nAnd this existence gives you such bliss, such ecstasy, such eternity, that you are bound to feel a tremendous sacredness, a great reverence for life and this vast universe which has given birth to you.\nOne day it will allow you to disappear again into the oceanic consciousness. This entering into the oceanic consciousness is enlightenment.\nShiki wrote:\nTHE MOON RISES --\nLEAF UPON LEAF UPON LEAF FLUTTERS DOWN.\nHe must be sitting under a tree, and it must be the time for fall. \"The moon rises ...\" -- he is watching the moon rising.\nZen has many ways of meditation -- watch the moon rising. The emphasis is on watching, not on the moon. Watch the sun rising. The emphasis is on watching, what I am calling witnessing to make it more clear -- witness the sun is rising. And witness \"leaf upon leaf upon leaf flutters down\" -- and you are just a witness.\nOn one side the sun is rising, on the other side, \"leaf upon leaf upon leaf flutters down.\"\nAnd between these two you are just a mirror, no judgment.\nHe is not saying that the sunrise is beautiful, and he is not saying that the leaf upon leaf upon leaf are creating beautiful music in the air. No, he is not making any judgment. He is simply describing what he has been witnessing, just like a mirror, showing you the sun is rising, and leaf upon leaf upon leaf is fluttering down. He is just a watcher.\nThis is the whole secret of Zen. Question 4\nManeesha's question:\nOUR BELOVED MASTER,\nST. BERNARD WROTE: \"WHO IS GOD? I CAN THINK OF NO BETTER ANSWER\nTHAN: HE WHO IS.\"\nECKHART STATED: \"THOU MUST LOVE GOD AS NOT-GOD, NOT- SPIRIT, NOT-PERSON, NOT-IMAGE, BUT AS HE IS -- A SHEER, PURE,\nABSOLUTE ONE, SUNDERED FROM ALL TWONESS AND IN WHOM WE MUST ETERNALLY\nSINK FROM NOTHINGNESS TO NOTHINGNESS.\"\nIF ONE SUBSTITUTED THE PRONOUN `HE' WITH ÌT', WOULD NOT THESE\nTWO CHRISTIAN MYSTICS BE SPEAKING THE LANGUAGE OF ZEN?\nManeesha, you can change thèhe' into ìt', and certainly they will be speaking the language of Zen, but you cannot do that. It is their statement, not yours. They are still saying `he'. They are not even saying `she'; ìt' is far away -- although they have come very close to the point. That's why both the saints were in trouble with the orthodox church, particularly Eckhart who was tortured, harassed, threatened to be expelled if he published his books. His books were published after his death because of these statements.\nThe statement is tremendously good, but still, somehow the faint image of God is present.\n\"Who is God? I can think of no better answer than: He who is.\" Using the word\n`he' and saying \"who is,\" is very close; only thèhe' is standing in between.\nThat's what I have been telling you -- even a very thin concept of God as a person is going to create enough of a barrier for you.\nSt. Bernard has come very close, but to be close is still to be at a distance. Closeness is a kind of distance. What does it mean? You may be one inch away, or one mile away, or one thousand miles away -- you are away. Even one inch away -- you are away. That one inch is as thick as the China Wall, solid rock.\nWhen St. Bernard says, \"He who is,\" using the word `he', he accepts a personality, and not only a personality but a male personality. Both are wrong. Existence is neither male nor female. It expresses in the both -- as female, as male, but it itself is simply pure isness. Its expression will be manifold, but its essence is the same. A woman in her interiority is as pure a consciousness as a man in his interiority.\nIf St. Bernard had really experienced isness, he would not have used the word\n`God' or\n`he'. He seems he must have been a great giant, but only intellectual. Many times philosophers have come very close, but then they go on in a round and go far away. Just coming close is not enough, but even this was condemned by the church, by the pope.\nCertainly St. Bernard has some conception of a male God, and you cannot change his statement. If you change his statement, then it comes exactly to what Zen is. But then it will not be the statement of St. Bernard, it will be your statement.\nSo I would say that he came very close, but because of thèGod', and because the programming in his mind of the Christian God was still there, that prevented him from the quantum leap from mind to no-mind. His idea is still within the mind. He has logically and rationally worked out that if God is there he can only be described as \"He who is.\" But this is not the exact experience.\nThe exact experience will not use the word `God', will not use the word `he'. It is male-chauvinistic, and it gives a personality to existence which it has not. It is infinite, so it cannot have a personality. It cannot be called who, and it cannot be called he.\nSo St. Bernard is still not enlightened -- intellectually great, logically great, but existentially still a little far away from the truth.\nEckhart comes even more close, maybe just a fragment of an inch away, when he says,\n\"Thou must love God as not-God, not-spirit, not-person, not-image, but as he is -\n- a sheer, pure, absolute One, sundered from all twoness and in whom we must eternally sink from nothingness to nothingness.\" He has come very much closer than St. Bernard, and hence he was more condemned than St. Bernard, because he was destroying the whole Christian theology.\nBut still I say he is within the framework of the Christian God, although he seems to be a far more refined intellect than St. Bernard -- a very thin barrier, a Japanese rice-paper barrier. But that is enough to keep your eyes closed.\nHis statement is beautiful: \"Thou must love God as not-God.\" But why use the\nword\n`God' at all if it is to be loved as not-God? Why not say, \"Thou must love not- God, not-Spirit, not-person, not-image, but just the sheer existence, pure, absolute One, sundered from all twoness, and in it we must eternally sink from nothingness to nothingness\"? But his beginning, \"Thou must love God,\" is a Christian programming.\nZen has dropped all programming. It has dared as much as human consciousness is capable of. Now making this statement has a certain compromise with the church. \"Thou must love God\" -- so the Christian church is satisfied that he is still talking about God, although a little crazy, because he says, you must love God as not-God. Then who is he?\na woman? a man? a tree? the ocean ...? What do you mean by \"not-God\"?\nSo Christianity condemned him, but because he was saying, \"Thou must love God,\" they told him not to publish such writings while he was alive, because they would create doubt in people's minds. And they have been doing that even today.\nThey prevented one great French scientist, Chardin, from publishing his papers about the Peking man -- he discovered the Peking man -- \"because your papers will go against Christianity.\" And because he was an ordained priest, he had to follow the orders from the Vatican. They destroyed a great man. He could have contributed much. But if you don't have any feedback, if other scientists don't know what you are writing, what you are discovering, and you don't know their opinions ... It needs constant feedback.\nScience grows, not by one scientist, it grows amongst all the scientists. There is a constant dialogue going on through papers, through conferences, through books, through periodicals ... a constant dialogue is happening all around the world. That's how science tries to figure out the best hypothesis about anything.\nNow preventing Chardin from publishing any paper, from attending any conference, from writing any book while he was alive -- and of course when you are dead somebody else will write it, you will not ... Somebody else does not have the same scientific background, nor the same discovery. And after your death what happens to your ideas will not be a feedback; you will not be able to improve upon it. They destroyed a great scientist of the same caliber as Albert\nEinstein.\nBut I am also angry at Chardin. Rather than stopping his writings and researches, why did he not resign from being a Christian priest? He resigned from science in favor of Christian superstition. Nobody has raised the question that he is also part of the whole slavery game; everybody has condemned the Vatican.\nI condemn the Vatican, but I also condemn Chardin -- Chardin more than the Vatican.\nThe Vatican has been doing that for centuries -- that is not new. But why was Chardin such a sheep? Why could he not gather the courage? A man of such tremendous intelligence should have left the priesthood. What was in it? A religion that prevents you from declaring truth is not worth being part of.\nBut he proved a coward -- he stopped writing. And now a Chardin society exists in France which publishes his works and papers and his researches -- but it is too late. If somebody raises a question, Chardin is not there to answer. And by the time Chardin died, other scientists had come to better hypotheses. If he had been allowed, or if he had had the guts to come out of the church, he would have managed to refine. It is a continuous growth and evolution. Science is not something static.\nWhen Albert Einstein was asked, \"If you had not discovered the theory of relativity, do you think it would ever have been discovered?\" Albert Einstein said, \"It would not have taken more than three weeks.\" And finally it was found that somebody in Germany had already discovered it before Albert Einstein, but he was a lazy guy and did not publish the paper. So not after three weeks, but three weeks before, it had been found.\nEinstein was right -- that when something is there, sooner or later it has to be discovered.\nYou cannot go on missing it if there is a truth in it.\nEckhart also proved to be a little cowardly, just like Chardin. He came very close, but he continuously maintained that he loved God. Of course he has those conditions \"as not-God ...\" Then as what? And if you are loving only the isness of existence, then why go on calling it God? Why continue that old superstition, that old lie? Just a compromise with the Vatican, just a fear that if you don't do\nthat much you are taking a risk with your life.\nI was born into Jainism, and when I started speaking against their ideologies -- and when I say anything I say it with my total being -- they were unable to answer me. Their highest command decided to expel me from Jainism. But I wrote to them: \"You need not expel me, I expel your whole Jainism and your whole Jaina society. You need not expel me, I have already expelled you.\" So they were shocked, they could not figure out what to do. They could not expel me, I was already outside -- what does it matter? And I don't think it has done any harm to me.\nCompromise is always cowardly. Truth never compromises.\nManeesha, both these people were very close to Zen, but both were cowards. God makes people cowards. Religion makes people cowards. Otherwise, what was the risk? Eckhart should have left Christianity, St. Bernard should have left Christianity, and then they would have been the very first Zen masters in the West. But they missed that great opportunity, that great dignity. They remained slaves of the Christian church.\nI want you to be lions and not like sheep as Jesus wanted you to be. He has insulted humanity very badly.\nIt is time for Sardar Gurudayal Singh -- a really great time. Put on the light, because I want to see the faces of my people laughing!\nThree women -- Betty Boobs, Lucy Legs, and Nellie Knickers -- meet at an old high-school reunion. They soon start gossiping about the men they have married, and what they are like in bed.\n\"My husband, Bob,\" says Betty Boobs, \"is like a 1989 Rolls Royce -- comfortable, sizeable, powerful, and very satisfying!\"\n\"My husband, Larry,\" says Lucy Legs, \"is like a 1970 Cadillac -- still fairly comfortable and satisfying, but lacks performance sometimes. Generally, quite a good ride.\"\n\"Hmm, my husband, Norbert,\" says Nellie Knickers, \"is like a vintage Model-T\nFord.\n\"Really?\" say the other two, staring at Nellie in amazement. \"Why do you say that?\"\n\"Well,\" continues Nellie, \"what I mean is -- he manages to rally twice a year, but he has to be started by hand!\"\nOn the forty-second floor of the Fast Buck Brokers building, executive vice- president, Bilbo Ballbag, is interviewing girls for a secretarial job.\nAfter examining many talented and capable applicants, Bilbo finally hires Gorgeous Gloria for the job.\nAfter two days, Gloria is bending down to get something from the bottom drawer of the filing cabinet, and Bilbo Ballbag gets an eyeful. He immediately calls her into his office.\n\"Look, Gloria,\" he says, his eyes playing with her tits, \"I wonder if you would mind working with me over the weekend?\"\n\"Sure,\" says Gloria, giving Bilbo a wink, \"that would be great.\"\n\"Good,\" replies Bilbo, \"we can get all this extra work done aboard my luxury sailboat!\"\n\"Ah, dear,\" says Gloria, \"but I get terribly seasick.\"\n\"Don't worry!\" says Bilbo, perspiring as he loosens his tie. \"I will take care of everything.\"\nThat evening, on his way home from work, Bilbo stops in at the drugstore. He goes up to the counter and approaches Victor Vaseline, the clerk.\n\"Give me a pack of Trojan condoms,\" says Bilbo, \"and a bottle of seasickness pills.\"\n\"Yes, sir,\" says Victor, fumbling around under the counter, and discreetly handing Bilbo the two items. \"It is none of my business, sir,\" continues Victor, \"but if it affects you like that, why do you bother?\"\nAmongst the early Christians, it was rumored that the Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, was blessed with enormous sexual machinery, which used to terrorize all his followers, men and women alike.\nAs the story goes: On that fateful day on Calvary Hill, Jesus had been hanging on his cross for a couple of hours, staring up at the sky, waiting for Godot.\nHe looks down and sees his favorite girl, Mary Magdalena, weeping in the crowd, and feels a stirring of the spirit in his loincloth.\n\"Mary! Mary!\" Jesus calls out. \"Come closer!\"\nHesitantly, Mary walks out of the crowd towards the cross. She comes closer, but stops in her tracks when she sees the huge growing lump in Christ's knickers.\n\"Mary! Mary!\" moans Jesus. \"Closer, come closer!\"\nMary shuffles forward nervously eyeing the ever-growing mountain in his underpants --\nthen she stops, again.\n\"Mary! Mary!\" gasps Jesus. \"I have something from the Holy Ghost to impart to you --\ncome closer!\"\n\"Ah! Christ, No!\" cries Mary, her eyes popping out. \"Don't give me anymore of that Holy Ghost shit! I can see your resurrection from here!\"\nNivedano ... (Drumbeat) (Gibberish) Nivedano ... (Drumbeat) Be silent ...\nClose your eyes, and feel your body to be completely frozen.\nThis is the right moment to enter inwards. Gather all your energy, your total consciousness, and rush towards the center of your being, which is just below your navel, inside -- two inches below, exactly -- with an urgency, as if this is the last moment of your life. Only those people have ever reached to their center who had this urgency, this intensity.\nFaster and faster ... Deeper and deeper ...\nAs you come closer to your inner center, a great silence descends over you just like soft rain with all its coolness. And inside you, a great peace arises, a peace that passeth understanding.\nA little more close -- and you feel so blessed.\nA little more close, and you are getting drunk with the divine. Just one step and you are at the center of your being, utterly ecstatic.\nAs you get centered, you are no more, just a pure isness. This isness we have called symbolically, the buddha. This is your original being.\nCentered, silent, no more your old being -- utterly naked, just a pillar of light ... you are the buddha.\nEverybody is born with a hidden buddha in him. The word buddha means the awakened one.\nIt is everybody's eternal birthright.\nThe buddha has only one quality: watching, witnessing. Witness that you are not the body.\nWitness that you are not the mind.\nAnd finally, witness that you are only a witness -- just a mirror reflecting everything.\nAt this moment you are the most fortunate people on the earth. Everybody is concerned with trivia; you are entering into the essential and the eternal.\nYou can feel a tremendous reverence for existence, a great joy in the sacredness of everything. The whole universe becomes your home; you are not an outsider.\nTo make your witnessing deeper, Nivedano ...\n(Drumbeat)\nRelax ... but go on remembering that you are only a witness.\nAs your witnessing deepens, you start melting into an ocean of consciousness. Ten thousand buddhas disappear into one consciousness, into one ocean of consciousness.\nGautama the Buddha Auditorium has turned into an ocean of consciousness without any waves and without any ripples -- utterly silent and quiet.\nThis is your real space, this is your no-mind. From this no-mind you can enter into the cosmos. This is the door, the opening.\nCollect the peace, the silence, the blissfulness, the ecstasy, the divine drunkenness, before Nivedano calls you back.\nAnd also persuade the buddha to come behind you -- he is your dhamma. He is your nature; you have just never requested him. And he has been waiting and waiting, hidden deep inside you. A sincere request, a welcoming heart, and he is bound to come behind you.\nThis is the first step of enlightenment: Gautam Buddha behind you as a shadow. But the shadow is miraculous, the shadow is not dark; the shadow is pure light, pure presence.\nYou can feel the warmth of it, you can almost feel the touch of it. It surrounds you with a new fragrance, and it gives you a totally new dimension to live.\nYour everyday acts start changing their color, their approach. Your very life\nbecomes meditative.\nAt the second stage, the buddha comes in front of you, and you become the shadow. To be a shadow of the buddha is a beautiful experience. And the experience goes on becoming deeper and deeper as the shadow disappears.\nAt the third and final stage, there is no more of you -- not even a shadow, only the buddha is.\nThis isness is the master key to open all the doors of the mysterious existence that surrounds you. Once you have the key, you are the master of your own being. There is nobody above you, there is nobody below you. For the first time you experience a tremendous communion with the whole existence.\nI call this the only authentic spirituality, the only authentic religiousness. Now don't forget to request the buddha to come behind you ...\nNivedano ... (Drumbeat)\nCome back ... but come as a buddha, with great grace, peace, silence.\nSit down for a few moments just to remember the golden path that you have traveled, the center that you have found within you, the opening into the cosmos, and all those fragrances from the beyond; the silence showering on you, and the warmth of the buddha who has come behind you.\nYou can feel him. It is your very nature. It is you in your truthfulness, in your existential experience.\nIf the first step is complete, the second will follow automatically. When the second is complete, the third will follow automatically.\nThe day you will complete the third step will be the most fortunate day in your life. That day you will be awakened from a long, long sleep, a spiritual sleep. That day you will become enlightened.\nThen there is no more birth, no more death. You have become one with the\nwhole.\nThis is the only holiness I know of. There is no other. Okay, Maneesha?\nYes, Beloved Master.\nI Celebrate Myself: God Is No Where, Life Is Now Here Chapter #3\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"30709","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/i_celebrate_myself/part1/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/i_celebrate_myself/>I Celebrate Myself</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Chapter title: The grand rebellion</h1><div class=post-meta>145 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;30709 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/I_Celebrate_Myself/part1.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=_index>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

And good news ...!</p><p>This evening we are starting a new series of talks: I CELEBRATE
MYSELF. GOD IS</p><p>NO WHERE: LIFE IS NOW HERE.</p><p>The statement of Friedrich Nietzsche that God is dead, is only
symbolic because God has never been in the first place -- not even born.
How can he be dead? But it was a tremendously powerful symbol to declare
that God is dead.</p><p>It was a recognition that we have been worshipping a lie. And it was
not only worshipping, we were being destroyed by a lie. We had been
exploited by the priesthood of all the organized religions. Our dignity
has been destroyed. We have been turned into puppets in the hands of a
fiction.</p><p>His declaration that God is dead simply means that Man is born. That
is the other side of the coin. And because man is born, he brings
freedom to the earth, he brings joy to the earth, he brings dignity to
the earth. And he destroys all that was clinging to the ultimate lie,
God -- all the superstitions, heaven and hell, all theologies, all
religions ... all kinds of false programming of man's being. They have
also died with God.</p><p>Hence, I celebrate myself and I celebrate you.</p><p>Friedrich Nietzsche's statement also includes another part: "God is
dead, therefore man is free." God was the slavery of man, he was the
bondage. He was the prison that did not allow humanity to rise to its
ultimate heights. He was keeping the whole of humanity reduced to
subhuman beings, sinners. His death is a great moment to celebrate.</p><p>His death means man has come of age. He is no longer a child and he
does not need a father figure. He can stand on his own feet. He is not a
sheep, as all the religions have been telling him, and he does not need
any shepherds. Jesus, Krishna, Mahavira, Mohammed, Moses ... no prophets
are needed, no saviors are needed, no messengers of God are needed. They
were all megalomaniacs, and in</p><p>the name of God they have been pushing human consciousness to the
lowest levels of existence.</p><p>The death of God cleans the whole sky outside and cleans the inner
world also, completely -- cleans you of all the belief systems, cleans
you of all prejudices, cleans you of all guilt. That is what he meant by
freedom. Freedom from guilt was possible only if God was dead. And once
you are free from God you have the whole sky to yourself, inner and
outer both -- you can open your wings in utter freedom. Without any
inhibition, and without any suppression, you can live your life with
joy, with song, with dance.</p><p>God not being there is a great event, the greatest event that has
happened in the whole history of mankind. The absence of God gives you a
certain solid presence. For the first time you are individuals,
independent souls -- not creatures who have been created, but individual
consciousnesses which have been in existence from eternity to
eternity.</p><p>This is a glorious moment for those who can understand all the
implications of God's death. They will immediately celebrate it, because
it gives you a new sense of direction, a new uniqueness, a new destiny.
It makes you a master of your own destiny. Nobody is there to guide you,
and nobody is there to dominate you, and nobody is there to give
commandments to you.</p><p>For the first time, in Nietzsche's statement, man comes of age. But
very few people have heard that God is dead and they are still
worshipping him. They are still praying in the churches, in the temples,
in the mosques. They are still holding the lie as if it is the
truth.</p><p>And because of that lie their whole life becomes phony. They cannot
laugh, they cannot enjoy. Their only duty, propounded by all the
religions, is to be masochists -- torture yourself as much as you can.
The more you torture yourself, the greater saint you are.</p><p>All the religions have been preaching nothing but masochism. That
gives me a deep insight into God.</p><p>Mankind has to be masochist, guilty -- torturing himself, torturing
and destroying his own roots in nature, going against nature ...
suffering all kinds of stupidities because God was a sadist. All the
religions, unknowingly, are propounding a God that is a sadist. He loves
humanity to suffer. He loves people</p><p>to torture themselves. He does not like your laughter, he does not
like your joy. He does not like your pleasure, your blissfulness, your
cheerfulness. He does not like your songs, and he does not like your
dances and your celebrations. He has taken away all that was beautiful
on this earth. He hates the earth!</p><p>He is against the earth. He is against life itself.</p><p>So what, in the name of God, your saints have been doing all these
thousands of years is nothing but committing a gradual suicide. The more
dead you are, the more you will find followers. The more alive you are,
the religions will condemn you, the masses will condemn you, all the
idiots of the world will be together to destroy you.</p><p>Joy is not acceptable. Laughter is not acceptable. A sense of humor
is not part of any religion. Life has become sad, misery, anguish,
anxiety. Who is responsible for all this?</p><p>The first responsibility is a fictitious God who is represented by
the priesthood around the world. Millions of people in this priesthood
are living on your blood. They are parasites not priests. And their
whole function is to keep you miserable, because only a miserable person
can bow down to a fictitious God. And they have been respecting those --
giving them prestige and honor -- who were nothing but insane
people.</p><p>Anybody who goes against life is insane. Life is all that we
have.</p><p>If you go against it, you are committing suicide. Maybe it is very
slow suicide -- it may take a few years for you to die. One religion,
Jainism -- unfortunately I have been born into that religion -- even
supports the idea of suicide. Other religions unconsciously support it,
but Jainism is clear about it.</p><p>It preaches that if you want to commit suicide, commit it because
this life is not worth living. This earth is not your home, your home is
beyond the clouds. They call it santhara, but it actually means slow
suicide. Whenever a man goes on santhara, he becomes immediately a great
saint. Santhara is a fast unto death -- no food, and in the end no
water. For a healthy man to die it takes almost ninety days, and those
ninety days are of immense self-torture. Jainism is simply making
conscious that which every religion has as an implication.</p><p>What have all the saints of the world been doing? And what is saintly
in their actions, in their behavior, in their style of life?</p><p>A man who was worshipped very much by the Christians in Egypt,
remained sitting on a high pole for twelve years! It was a ruin of an
old palace, and only one pillar was standing high. It was very
difficult; it was a small place to remain on for twelve years. He could
not sleep -- he had to tie himself to the pillar. He could not come down
even to go to the toilet, so he was defecating from the pillar, pissing
from the pillar ... and people were worshipping him ...!</p><p>He must have suffered immensely just to get this honor, honor from
the ignorant masses.</p><p>Just to get this prestige of being a great saint, he was living in
utter dirtiness, ugliness.</p><p>And he dropped from the pillar only when he died. A great memorial
exists in his name because he has done the greatest penance against the
original sin of Adam and Eve.</p><p>Strange ways have been found how to take your pride. Now Adam and Eve
have committed a sin? I don't think they have committed any sin. They
were simply provoked by God to eat from the Tree of Knowledge and from
the Tree of Eternal Life. To prohibit anything is to provoke -- it is a
simple psychology. God could have learned much from Sigmund Freud.</p><p>In the Garden of Eden where God lived, there were millions of trees.
If he had not prohibited those two trees, I don't think that even by now
we would have found them ...</p><p>millions of trees with beautiful fruits. We would have still been
chewing grass in the Garden of Eden just like the buffaloes. If anybody
committed the sin it was God himself.</p><p>And why did he prohibit his own children from eating from the Tree of
Knowledge? No father would do it. Every father wants his children to be
as wise as possible. And why should a father prevent his own children
from eating the fruit which will make them eternal, immortal. Every
father would love -- even ordinary fathers on the earth would love their
children to be immortals.</p><p>What kind of God was this? And if this is God -- who prevents his
children from becoming wise, from becoming Socrates, and Gautam Buddha,
and Lao Tzu, this is not a god worth having. If he has not died by
himself, then somebody has to murder him. He has tortured humanity
enough.</p><p>And strange is the fact that it was the Devil who persuaded Eve to
eat from the Tree of Knowledge. He showed her why God was preventing
them. He does not want anybody to be equal to him -- and you call this
God compassionate? And you call this God love? The Devil was far more
loving, far more compassionate! In fact, he showed man the way of
wisdom, the way of immortality.</p><p>God is preventing his own children because he does not want them to
be wise, he does not want them to be immortal. If they are immortal and
wise then they will be equal to God, and he is afraid of their equality
-- a very jealous God. In fact, the Old Testament declares it through
God himself. God says, "I am a very jealous God." He certainly is. He
was jealous of his own children. He is not even worthy to be called a
father. If the Devil had not told Eve, "You have to eat these fruits,
only then will you know in your innermost being that you are also
gods</p><p>..."</p><p>As the story is, it makes it clear that the Devil was more in favor
of human individuality, respect, dignity. God was against man from the
very beginning. The whole evolution that has happened in science ...
`Science' in its very roots means knowledge. Anything that has evolved
in the inner consciousness of man</p><p>-- the awakened ones, the enlightened ones who have come to know that
life is eternal, it is a festival, beginningless, endless -- would not
have been possible without the Devil. The Devil was the first rebellion
against a dictatorial God.</p><p>And I have to tell you that the word `devil' is much more meaningful
than the word</p><p>`God'. `God' simply means nothing, but `devil' comes from the
Sanskrit root div. From div are derived `devil' and `day' in English; in
Hindustani from dev, devata, which means divine; from div, divas, which
mean daybreak, the beginning of the day, the end of the night. The Devil
seems to be more divine than God. God seems to be really a very mean
fellow, and it is good that he is dead otherwise somebody would have to
shoot him. It is good that he died by himself, and we had not to have
his blood on our hands.</p><p>But once God is no longer there, your freedom becomes a tremendous
responsibility. It should not fall down into licentiousness, it should
rise into enlightenment. Freedom brings responsibility. And I want you
to understand that responsibility does not mean duty, it means only the
ability to respond. Ability to respond to what? To every situation,
moment to moment you should be so aware that you can find original
responses to every original situation. Nothing in existence ever
repeats.</p><p>They say history repeats itself, because man is an idiot. But
existence never repeats itself, because existence is intelligence,
wisdom, eternity. History will also stop repeating once there are
millions of buddhas around the world, millions of people who have the
sense of being alert, aware, conscious, and who feel that they have a
great responsibility moment to moment -- not according to any scripture
but according to everyone's consciousness.</p><p>Freedom brings many fruits, and many flowers, and many gifts to you.
The death of God is not something to be sorry and sad for. It is
something to rejoice, something to dance, something to celebrate. At
last man is free from guilt, man is free from a constant judgmental eye
from the sky.</p><p>It is strange that The Holy Bible says, "Judge ye not," but God does
only one thing, judge. And they have also determined a day called The
Judgment Day. To man it is said,</p><p>"Judge ye not" -- and God is continuously judging, and is going to
judge finally at The Judgement Day. What kind of contradiction ...?</p><p>Just today I have received a letter from a few Christians saying that
the Bible says,</p><p>"Judge ye not." But I am not a Christian, and I don't have any
obligation to follow the Bible. I am not a Hindu ... I am not a person
who belongs to any religion, so I don't have any obligation to follow
The Holy Bible or holy Koran, or holy Bhagavadgita. All holy scriptures
as I have looked into them, are absolutely unholy.</p><p>These four or five Christians who have written a letter to me want me
not to judge Christians or Catholics, because the Bible says, "Judge ye
not" -- and they are judging me! And their Bible says, "Judge ye not." I
am not a Christian so I have no obligation to follow the Bible. They are
Christians, they should not</p><p>judge me. I am free to judge, and I am free to judge everybody
because I don't have any prejudice against anybody. I don't belong to
any organization, to any system of beliefs. A God who teaches people,
"Judge ye not," himself goes on judging -- and you don't see the
contradiction?</p><p>Jesus says, "God is love," but there seems to be no love flowing from
the skies to humanity. In three thousand years we have fought five
thousand wars. What kind of God is there who allows Genghis Khan to be
born? Tamerlane to be born? Nadirshah to be born? These three
generations of one family killed one hundred million people, and they
were never defeated.</p><p>What kind of God allows President Truman to drop atom bombs on
Hiroshima and Nagasaki? What kind of God is allowing all the stupid
politicians of the world to pile up nuclear weapons which will only
prove to be a global death?</p><p>But as I told you, God is a sadist. He enjoys when you are suffering.
He enjoys when you are in pain. He enjoys when you are poor. He enjoys
when you are starving to death. His enjoyment is simply sick!</p><p>The word `sadism' comes from a French count, de Sade; he used to
torture women. He was a super-rich man, a count, and had a vast
territory under his control. So any beautiful woman would be dragged to
his torture chamber. You all have love chambers; he had a torture
chamber -- that was his love chamber. And as the woman entered she could
not believe what was going to happen because all over the walls were
hanging different kinds of instruments of torture. He also used to carry
a box, a portable torture chamber --</p><p>because who knows? He may find a woman in a hotel room and he may not
have his instruments.</p><p>All those instruments ... First he would force the woman to be naked
-- not in a loving way -- he would tear off her clothes, he would
scratch her body, he would start beating her ... and he had all those
instruments. You have heard only the word `screwing' -- he really used
to use screws to make holes in the woman's body. Unless there was blood
he did not get excited. When he saw the woman in utter torture, then he
was in great sexual excitement, then he would make love.</p><p>And perhaps something of de Sade exists in every masochist man.
Unless there is a pillow fight, unless there is some conflict before
going to bed, a man seems not to be excited. A woman who beats him, hits
him, throws things at him,</p><p>excites him.</p><p>The only perfect couple possible in the world would be if one partner
was a sadist, and the other partner was a masochist. `Masochist' also
comes from another count who enjoyed torturing himself. His name was
Masoch; hence the word `masochist'. Both were imprisoned for insanity,
both were found guilty; one of torturing others, and one of torturing
himself.</p><p>God must be a sadist on a far bigger scale than de Sade. He is
omnipotent, omnipowerful, omnipresent -- everywhere. You cannot escape
him; his eyes of judgment are following you day and night, twenty-four
hours, wherever you are. He is threatening you that you will fall into
hellfire for eternity.</p><p>Even a man like Bertrand Russell refused to be a Christian for the
simple reason</p><p>-- he has given many other reasons, but the first reason was "I
cannot accept a God who is so unjust" -- that in Christianity there is
only one life.</p><p>Even if you live a life of one hundred years, as Bertrand Russell
almost managed to live, one century ... He counted very honestly the
sins that Christians call sins</p><p>-- they are not sins, they are just natural experiences. They have
been converted into sins to torture you.</p><p>Making love to a woman is not sin, but it has become a sin. Both are
feeling immensely guilty that they are doing something against God.</p><p>So he counted all those so-called sins which are not sins, but just
for the argument's sake he counted all the sins that he had committed.
And he also counted all the sins that he had dreamed about but he had
not committed. Still he said, "The most strict judge cannot put me in
jail for more than four and a half years, and God is going to throw me
into hellfires for eternity! There seems to be no proportion."</p><p>If you go on committing sin and don't do anything else, just sin and
sin and sin from the moment you are born till the moment you are in your
grave, then too, an eternity of hellfire is not just, it is not
justice.</p><p>God seems to enjoy hellfire. God seems to enjoy poisoning all your
pleasures -- you should not enjoy any of your senses. Different
religions have different emphases, but the point is the same.
Mohammedans are not allowed to listen to music. Strange? It is sin
because you are enjoying a sense, your hearing. You are</p><p>giving pleasure to your ears, so you are not to be allowed to listen
to great music.</p><p>I cannot conceive in what way music can be a sin. But the idea is
that enjoyment is sin, so whatever you can enjoy has to be
condemned.</p><p>Jainism says you should not enjoy taste, you should eat without any
taste. You are putting man into such a guilt. How can he avoid tasting?
When it is sweet, it is sweet! When it is bitter, it is bitter! On his
tongue there are sensitive buds which decide the taste. Unless you have
plastic surgery and remove all the buds from your tongue, you cannot
manage not to taste the food.</p><p>But they have poisoned your enjoyment. Just small enjoyments --
eating your food with love and joy with friends is condemned. And it is
not only one sense, but all five senses.</p><p>Gautam Buddha is against touching a woman. Even touch is a sin,
because touching a woman is a joy. She is warmer than you, she is more
fragile than you, she is more beautiful than you. And what is wrong if
touching a woman gives you joy? Joy cannot be wrong. And you are not
harming anybody, you are not interfering by touching the woman against
her will. She enjoys being touched; you enjoy being the toucher. Why
should God come in between?</p><p>But he is there always, following you as a judge. He has become your
inner conscience.</p><p>Your inner conscience is false! It is created by the religions. So
God does not depend only on himself, he depends on the priests to create
a conscience in you. It is not consciousness, it is conscience -- a
false entity which continuously goes on saying to you,</p><p>"This is not right. The scriptures are against ... God is against .…
Don't do this!" And your whole nature wants to do it.</p><p>Jaina monks are not allowed even to have a bath or a shower, every
day, because that is enjoying the coolness of water, enjoying your
body's freshness. You can see these people are criminals. The Jaina monk
is not allowed even to make his teeth clean. He cannot use any
toothbrush, or any toothpaste, or any mouthwash. It is so difficult to
talk to a Jaina monk -- his breath is so disgusting, his whole body is
disgusting.</p><p>In a hot country like India you perspire ... and Jaina monks have to
travel on dirty, dusty paths. They cannot ride in any vehicle because
that is pleasure; they have to walk. So they are walking on dusty roads
in villages, and their perspiration under the hot sun, blazing hot,
showering fire on the earth ... They become ugly, they become really
tanned.</p><p>Their bodies, their skin shrinks. And dust upon dust, layer upon
layer ...</p><p>All the religions have shared in some way or other the desire that
man's every pleasure should be poisoned. Only then will he turn towards
the priest to get some advice, because he is miserable. Make him
miserable, take away all the possibilities of pleasure.</p><p>I have not come across any Indian woman who knows what orgasm is. In
fact, in the Hindi language there is no word equal to òrgasm'. The
Indian woman has never known orgasm. Even the Western woman has started
to know about orgasm just thirty years ago.</p><p>It was due to the research of psychologists, psychoanalysts and
psychiatrists. Sigmund Freud, Havelock Ellis, Masters and Johnson --
they opened a new door to women's pleasure.</p><p>For centuries they did not know what orgasm was, so naturally, they
were disgusted with sex. They thought that the man was simply using
them, because they were not getting any enjoyment out of it. But the
reason was that the man has not been allowing them to have an
orgasm.</p><p>In the very primitive days he must have become aware that a woman can
have multiple orgasms, and a man can have only one orgasm. So a man is
not competent to fulfill a woman. Either he has to call his friends, or
he has to get some hormonal injections, because a woman ordinarily is
capable of having six orgasms one after the other.</p><p>It is better not to let her know that she is capable of any orgasm.
It can be avoided, because the woman's vagina is insensitive. It has to
be insensitive because it will be giving birth to a child. If it was
sensitive, the birth of a child would have immensely increased pain; it
is insensitive and still there is pain.</p><p>So the woman's orgasm has nothing to do with the vagina, it is just a
reproductive mechanism. Her orgasm is not dependent on a man making
love</p><p>through the vagina --</p><p>that is good for reproduction. She has a separate part, just a very
small part -- the clitoris -</p><p>- which is not in the way of man's making love to her. Unless the man
understands the physiology of the woman, which ordinarily no man
understands</p><p>...</p><p>Man is the only inexperienced lover in the world, because neither
does he have any experience before your marriage, nor does the woman
have any experience before the marriage. This is a very strange world.
When two people are going to live together for their whole lives they
don't have any experience, they don't know what to do.</p><p>The woman's clitoris is the organ which gives her pleasure, and it is
not part of her vagina. Man's ejaculation is just two minutes or three
minutes at the most. And he has to be quick, because if you are
committing sin, commit it quickly. Don't do it too long, otherwise,
remember hellfire.</p><p>Unless a man understands the physiology of a woman, which he has
never bothered ...</p><p>her whole body is sexually sensitive. Man's whole body is not
sexually sensitive. The man's sexuality is very local; it is just in his
sexual machinery. The woman's whole body is sexual, and unless the man
plays with her whole body and arouses her body -- that is foreplay ...
No man wants to do it, because it will take too long, and one has to be
quick before God comes in. So no more foreplay!</p><p>Christians particularly, introduced the missionary position, in which
the beauty is under, and the beast is on top. The poor woman has to lie
down almost dead, and only then is she considered to be a lady. Only
prostitutes enjoy. No woman of honor will groan or moan, or start
gibberish or screaming out of joy. So she has been told to be completely
dead while the man is making love. It is one-sided love. The other side
is completely dead; the other side has not been aroused.</p><p>The people who understand sexology say the woman should be on top so
that she has more possibility of movement, and the man should be
underneath her so he can remain silent, because his ejaculation happens
in just two minutes! If he remains silent he can manage twenty minutes
or thirty minutes. A woman needs</p><p>at least ten minutes to become aroused. This disparity is there, and
it can be fulfilled only if the man understands that the woman is not
just a mechanism to be used. She is also a soul, equally alive, and has
all rights to pleasure just as you have.</p><p>So foreplay is needed, and the man should be underneath and the woman
should be on top. The man should lie down like a lady, and the woman
should be a real rascal! Then only is there a possibility that they come
to orgasm at the same time. When they both start throbbing and getting
out of control, that is the moment when they know what sex contains. It
is not only a reproductive organ, it is also an organ of immense
pleasure. And that pleasure, according to me, gives you the first
glimpse of meditation, because the mind stops, time stops. For those few
moments there is no time, and there is no mind, you are just utterly
silent and blissful.</p><p>I say it -- it is my scientific approach to the subject -- because
there was no other way for man to find out that if there is no mind and
no time, you enter into a blissful state. Except for sex there was no
other possibility for the mind to understand that there was some way of
going beyond mind, beyond time. It was certainly sex which gave the
first glimpse of meditativeness. And I am being condemned all over the
world because I am telling people the truth.</p><p>Nobody has come up with any other idea to explain how you have found
meditation. You cannot find it by just walking on the side of the road
-- it is lying there and you go over and pick up meditation. Where have
you found meditation? Not a single person in the whole world ... and I
have been discussed around the world, condemned, just because I am
talking about going from sex to superconsciousness. But nobody has given
any explanation why they are condemning me because of my book -- which
has been translated into thirty-four languages, has gone into dozens of
editions, and is read by all the monks whether they are Hindu, Jaina,
Christian, Buddhist. Monks are the best customers for that book.</p><p>Here there was a Jaina conference just a few months ago, and my
secretary, Neelam, informed me, "It is strange. Jaina monks come and
they ask for one book only, FROM</p><p>SEX TO SUPERCONSCIOUSNESS. Then they hide it in their clothes and
just get out of the door silently so nobody finds them out."</p><p>The book, FROM SEX TO SUPERCONSCIOUSNESS, is not about sex, it is
about superconsciousness. But the only possible way for man to find that
there is some door, some way to go beyond his thoughts into eternal
silence ... Even though it lasts only one moment, that moment is
eternity -- everything stops. You forget all the worries, all the
tensions.</p><p>Have you ever heard of any man getting a heart attack while he was
making love? It should have happened more often if the religions were
true. God would be so angry, that at least he could give a heart attack.
Hellfire will be after death; right now ...</p><p>But no man has died while making love, because making love takes away
your stress. It is stress that can give you a heart attack. It is stress
that can drive you mad and insane. It is sex that keeps you sane, keeps
you normal, keeps you within the boundaries of sanity.</p><p>Otherwise you are going to be a pervert, and perversion does not give
you the same key of superconsciousness.</p><p>Homosexuals cannot have the same experience that is possible in a
heterosexual relationship. Nor can lesbians have the same orgasmic
experience. But ten percent of American men have accepted that they have
homosexual tendencies, and thousands of women have married women --
lesbian couples. And this year it is expected that forty thousand babies
will be born out of lesbian couples. From where are these babies coming?
From artificial insemination. Now hospitals are not only carrying a
blood bank, but a semen bank. So when a lesbian couple wants a baby, the
one who is ready to take the trouble for nine months, gets an injection
of somebody anonymous. An injection is not a joy. An injection cannot
give you any orgasm. Although doctors call it "the prick,"</p><p>it is not the prick.</p><p>When my personal physician, Amrito, came for the first time from
England -- and he is a member of the Royal College of Physicians, highly
educated -- he would say to me,</p><p>"Now comes the prick!" Then I would start laughing, "Amrito, this is
not the prick. You have been misguided." Now he silently gives me the
injection without saying anything.</p><p>These forty thousand babies will be born this year in America through
an injection. Now those women are completely out of the possibility of
having an orgasm. And there are homosexuals all around the world, even
very intelligent people.</p><p>I have chosen this title, I CELEBRATE MYSELF from one of the most
important poets of America, Walt Whitman. But he was a homosexual --
that's where he goes wrong. All his poetry becomes superficial; he knows
nothing about orgasmic joy. But you will be surprised to know that even
a man like Socrates was a homosexual; hence he could not become a Gautam
Buddha. Howsoever intelligent, and howsoever great a logician he was,
his dialogues are great but something is missing. He is not a man of
great consciousness. He has become unnatural, he has gone against
nature.</p><p>But religions are forcing people to go against nature. The third man
in England's hierarchy of the church ... the archbishop in England's
church is equivalent to the Polack pope. This man has only one man
between him and the archbishop, and there is every possibility that this
bishop will some time become archbishop of England. He has come with the
idea that celibacy simply means no heterosexual relationship, but it
does not include homosexuality, it does not include masturbation, it
does not include making love to an animal -- sodomy, bestiality. It does
not include anything. Celibacy simply prevents you from being
heterosexual. Great religious leaders ...!</p><p>Fifty percent of monks in monasteries are homosexuals. And there are
possibilities like the monastery of Mount Athos where thousands of monks
live</p><p>... They have not seen any woman since they have become monks,
because no woman is allowed to enter -- not even a six-month-old girl is
allowed into the monastery. When I heard this, I thought, "Are those
monks, monks or monsters?" And they have their own church-state, so they
have their own guards and police.</p><p>For one thousand years no woman has ever entered into the monastery.
And anybody who becomes a monk in the Mount Athos monastery cannot get
out alive again. Only when he is dead, will his body be taken out; it is
a lifelong commitment. No intelligent man can commit himself even for
tomorrow. Who knows what will happen tomorrow?</p><p>That's what I call responsibility. A man who is responsible will not
commit</p><p>himself to anything, will not promise anything, because who knows
about tomorrow? Let tomorrow come and we will see. I will respond with
my totality whatever the situation, but I cannot commit myself. I have
never promised anybody anything. I have never committed myself to
anything in my whole life. Let the tomorrow come. One never knows, this
may be my last day and I may not be there tomorrow to fulfill my
promise.</p><p>Time goes on changing -- I may not be the same tomorrow, you may not
be the same tomorrow. Today there is great love between me and you.
Tomorrow, who knows? Love disappears, not only disappears, but sometimes
turns into hate.</p><p>A man of awareness lives moment to moment -- that is his celebration.
He enjoys everything of the world without any inhibition. Because God is
dead he need not be worried. And with God, hell is dead, hellfire has
been put off. With him, heaven is also dead. So don't be greedy for
heaven, and don't be afraid of hell. Just live moment to moment with a
dance, with a joy, with cheerfulness, with courage.</p><p>Encounter every situation with your total consciousness, without any
guilt. Enjoy music, enjoy food, enjoy love -- enjoy everything that is
natural.</p><p>God has been against nature, God has been against enlightenment, and
God has been against your experience of eternity.</p><p>God was your enemy.</p><p>It is good that he is dead.</p><p>This is the good news for this evening. Now your questions.</p><p>Question 1</p><p>The first question:</p><p>I HAVE BEEN SURROUNDED SINCE MY CHILDHOOD BY PEOPLE WHO</p><p>WANTED ME TO BELIEVE IN GOD AND TO FOLLOW HIS COMMANDMENTS.</p><p>WHY ARE THE GOD BELIEVERS ALWAYS TRYING TO CONVERT OTHERS?</p><p>This is a very delicate question.</p><p>You may not immediately grasp why God believers are always trying to
convert others.</p><p>The reason is they have their own doubts, and by converting others
they are able to repress their doubts. If they can convert many people
... by converting others they are also converting themselves. When they
see that one thousand people have started believing in God -- "Perhaps
God is. My doubt was useless." When they see that the whole world
believes in God -- the whole world cannot be wrong. That is the
argument, very ancient, as ancient as man: the whole world cannot be
wrong. And I say unto you, only single individuals, rare individuals
have been right. When something is believed by the whole world,
remember, it is certainly going to be wrong! The masses are living like
somnambulists, sleepwalkers, in utter unconsciousness. Their belief
systems cannot be right.</p><p>I have told you a small story .…</p><p>One journalist died, and as journalists are pushy people he knocked
immediately on the Pearly Gates. He took it for granted that he was
going to Heaven and that he was going to have an interview with God.
This would be the first interview ever.</p><p>Saint Peter opened the doors. He asked, "What do you want?" He said,
"An interview with God, and this is my card."</p><p>But Saint Peter said, "You cannot enter Heaven. Your name is not on
the list. And anyway we don't need any journalists. We have a quota: one
dozen journalists, and they are already in."</p><p>And they are useless in Heaven because nothing happens, no sensation.
All the saints are almost dead -- sitting on their white clouds, playing
their harp, "Alleluia! Alleluia!" Now this is going to be forever, so
what news ...?</p><p>George Bernard Shaw exactly defined what news is: When a dog bites a
man, it is not news; when a man bites a dog, it is news.</p><p>But in Heaven, there are no dogs, only dead-as-dodo saints.</p><p>"So the newspaper started," Saint Peter told him, "but only the first
issue was published.</p><p>There was no news for the second issue. So even those twelve
journalists are just waiting for nothing.</p><p>"It is good you knock on the other door; that is Hell, and there is
always great news there.</p><p>Everything that you may not have even imagined is happening, because
all the great intellectuals are there, all the great politicians are
there, all the great criminals are there ...</p><p>everybody of any importance is there! So you go there."</p><p>He said, "But being a journalist, I cannot go so easily. You will
have to give me at least twenty-four hours to have a look around Heaven.
If I can persuade some journalist from your quota to go to Hell, are you
ready to accept me?"</p><p>Saint Peter said, "It doesn't matter. If somebody is ready to go to
Hell you can take his place. This is good. For twenty-four hours you can
have a walk around."</p><p>The moment he entered Heaven he started spreading a lie that there
was going to be a very great newspaper starting soon in Hell, and a
chief editor, and an associate chief editor, assistant editors, and all
kinds of journalists were needed. He went on spreading the news so it
reached to all the twelve journalists.</p><p>After twenty-four hours he went to see Saint Peter, to inquire
whether anybody had gone out. Saint Peter immediately closed the door
and told him, "You remain in. All the twelve have gone out."</p><p>He said, "My God! All have gone out? Then I don't want to be here.
Something must be right, otherwise I could not have convinced twelve
people."</p><p>Saint Peter said, "Are you sane or insane? You created the lie."</p><p>He said, "I know I created the lie, but there must be something
corresponding actually happening. I cannot remain here, just open the
doors!"</p><p>That is the reason why every religion is interested in converting
people, because every religion, every priest, every pope, every saint,
every Ayatollah Khomeini, every shankaracharya, are all deep down full
of doubt because belief cannot destroy doubt.</p><p>Belief can only repress doubt. A blind man can believe in light, but
that does not mean he knows light. All your believers are blind people
who don't know anything about the truth.</p><p>Hence the doubt is just repressed underneath the belief.</p><p>To keep one's belief strong enough, one needs to propagate it
continuously. That's why all the religious propagandists you see are
very fundamentalist, almost fanatics, fascists.</p><p>Have you seen the Jehovah Witnesses? They go on shouting, beating
their drums, shouting whether you listen or not. They don't look at your
eyes, they just look at the ground and they go on shouting, and they go
on reading passages from the Bible. Just to get rid of them people
purchase their Bibles.</p><p>Why are these people so much interested in converting people? The
psychological reason is they are afraid. Their own belief is very thin;
anytime doubt may arise. Doubt is very existential. Belief is only a
program that has been given by your parents, and by your priests, and by
your teachers, and by your society. But it is only a program.</p><p>In the Soviet Union they are giving a different program: there is no
God. Every child believes that there is no God. All communists believe
there is no God.</p><p>Half of the world is communist now, so half of the world for the
first time believes there is no God. It is not that they know, it is not
that they have explored the outer sky, or they have explored the inner
consciousness and have found that there is no God. They just have been
told, just as you have been told that there is God.</p><p>Every religion tries to convert people, because those who are inside
the fold are full of doubt. When the fold starts growing, their doubts
are settled, their belief becomes thicker, weightier -- "So many people
cannot be wrong."</p><p>And have you watched this? Whenever a person moves from one religion
to</p><p>another religion, the new religion that he has entered gives him
great respect and honor. The older religion condemns him, that he has
betrayed, but the new religion gives him great honor because he has
confirmed their belief -- "Even people belonging to other religions are
coming into our fold. Our fold must have the truth, otherwise why are
people coming?"</p><p>All these missionaries all around the world bringing people to
Catholicism are just making the Catholics inside the fold believe, "You
are the real religion, and other religions are just so-so."</p><p>A man of truth never tries to convert you.</p><p>A man of truth conveys his experience to you. He shares his
experience with you, but that does not mean that you have to agree with
him. It does not mean either that you have to disagree with him. It was
his joy to share, and that's where he is finished.</p><p>No man of truth has been ever a missionary. All missionaries are
trying to convince the insiders that they are right because outsiders
are coming in. All missionaries are trying to convince themselves also,
that their belief system must have some truth in it; otherwise why do
people get converted?</p><p>So that is the reason God believers are always trying to convert
other people. Otherwise, conversion is an interference into other
people's freedom. You can enjoy sharing with your friends, with their
consent, whatever you have experienced -- not your beliefs but your
experience. And if you have no experience, be honest, be truthful. Say,
"I don't have any experience. I have only a bunch of beliefs others have
given me, which are not my experience. I am carrying borrowed knowledge,
I don't know anything on my own, hence I cannot recommend anything to
you."</p><p>What am I doing here? I am not trying to convert you to any religion,
or to any cult, or to any creed. I don't have any belief system, I don't
have any theology, I don't have any philosophy, I don't have any
religion. What I am trying to convey is my experience of truth. If it
can be of any use to you, you can use it. If you see it is not of any
use to you, that's perfectly all right. It is your freedom, I will not
interfere in your freedom. I will not trespass your individuality. I
respect you, I love you. How can I convert you?</p><p>So no man of truth, no man of compassion, no man of authentic
experience is</p><p>ever a converter. It is all those believers, who are afraid of their
own doubt, who want to keep the insiders in, and go on bringing new
people from outside. It helps the believers to have thicker beliefs, and
thicker beliefs make your intelligence also retarded. The thicker the
belief, the more retarded the intelligence. No belief helps your
intelligence to grow, even though there is space enough to grow. When
you go on pushing beliefs and hiding your doubt in your unconscious
corners of darkness, you are crippling yourself. You are destroying your
own buddhahood, you are destroying your own potential.</p><p>You could have been one of the enlightened ones, but you will remain
just a Catholic, or a Hindu, or a Mohammedan. And these are all
fictions, beautiful fictions. You can enjoy them as stories, as novels,
but don't call them "holy" scriptures.</p><p>Four hundred and eighty-eight pages in the Holy Bible are pure
pornography. I sometimes wonder why people go on missing those four
hundred and eighty- eight pages -</p><p>- not one page, or two pages. I told one of my friends to pick out
all those pages, and he has published a book of four hundred and
eighty-eight pages taken out of the Old Testament. Every passage is so
obscene, so ugly, and you go on calling it the Holy Bible.</p><p>Even playboys and their magazine PLAYBOY, and the playgirls and their
magazine PLAYGIRL, and PENTHOUSE are nothing compared to the Holy
Bible.</p><p>They are nothing compared to the temples of Khajuraho in India. Even
Mahatma Gandhi was so ashamed that he wanted thirty temples of Khajuraho
... which are great sculpture.</p><p>Nowhere have have men and women been sculpted so beautifully -- but
they are making love, they are utterly naked, and millions of statues in
those thirty temples ...</p><p>There used to be one hundred temples; seventy have been destroyed by
the Mohammedans. Thirty were saved because they were hidden behind thick
forest.</p><p>Mahatma Gandhi wanted them to be covered with mud so nobody could see
them.</p><p>You must have heard about the three famous monkeys of Mahatma Gandhi
-- he used to keep them on his table. Even though he is dead, they are
still sitting on his table. Those three monkeys were sent from Japan by
a friend. They are a beautiful piece of sculpture, but they are not
complete. They came from China to Japan, and the original set used to be
of four monkeys, not three.</p><p>The fourth monkey seems to have been taken by the friend out of the
set, or perhaps ... I suspect Mahatma Gandhi himself cut the fourth
monkey out of the set. I have to describe the monkeys so you can
understand why he should have cut ... because three is not the original
set.</p><p>The first monkey is keeping his hands on his ears. The second monkey
is keeping his hands on his eyes. The third monkey is keeping his hands
on his mouth. And the fourth monkey is missing.</p><p>The fourth monkey -- I know the fourth monkey. In the original set
the fourth monkey was holding his hands on his genitals.</p><p>Mahatma Gandhi interpreted them -- I don't agree with his
interpretation. He interpreted that the monkey who is holding his hands
on the ears says, "Don't listen to anything evil."</p><p>And the monkey who is holding his hands on the eyes says, "Don't see
anything evil."</p><p>And the third monkey who has his hands on the mouth is indicating,
"Don't say anything evil." Now, you can understand why the fourth monkey
has been dropped -- in fact he should not have been dropped if Gandhi
had really been a man of truth. The fourth monkey is the logical
conclusion: "Hide the origin of all evil."</p><p>But this is not my interpretation. Knowing the people, and knowing
that Charles Darwin has this great idea that man has come from monkeys
-- and there is every possibility, because your mind still functions
like a monkey. My interpretation, when I went to see Mahatma Gandhi's
ashram ... He was dead, but his son Ramdas was my friend, so he invited
me and he showed me around. It is an ugly place -- Mahatma Gandhi was a
great self-torturer and he forced torture on other people.</p><p>I said, "These three monkeys ... where is the fourth? -- because I
know the whole</p><p>set."</p><p>He said, "I have never heard about the fourth." And he told me
Mahatma Gandhi's interpretation.</p><p>I said, "That is not right. Looking at humanity, looking into
humanity's psychology ...</p><p>The first monkey says, `Don't listen to the truth because it will
disturb all your consoling lies.'</p><p>"The second monkey says, `Don't look at the truth; otherwise your God
will be dead and your heaven and hell will disappear.'</p><p>"The third monkey says, `Don't speak the truth, otherwise you will be
condemned, crucified, poisoned, tortured by the whole crowd, the
unconscious people. You will be condemned -- don't speak the truth!'</p><p>"And the missing fourth monkey says, `Hide your pleasures. Hide your
enjoyment, don't show it to anybody.'"</p><p>People can respect you if you are miserable, but if you are happy
everybody is jealous of you.</p><p>People have been asking me why my commune failed in America. It never
failed. The reason it was destroyed by the violence of the American
government was that it was such a successful experiment. Never has there
been a commune in the whole history of man so successful.</p><p>That was the trouble. If we had failed, nobody would have bothered
about us, but we succeeded. In five years we fought against the greatest
power in the world -- and we had no power. We were not a nation, we had
no army ... but we had truth on our side.</p><p>The commune was destroyed because it was successful.</p><p>The fourth monkey is saying, "Keep your pleasures, your joys, hidden.
Don't let anybody know that you are a cheerful man, a blissful man, an
ecstatic man, because that will destroy your very life. It is
dangerous."</p><p>And looking at humanity I can say without any doubt that my
interpretation is far better than Mahatma Gandhi's. He himself for his
whole life was teaching celibacy. But he was an honest man, about that I
have no doubt. His honesty is clear. Even at the age of seventy he was
having nightmares about sex, and in his dreams he was ejaculating -- at
the age of seventy! This is a whole life of suppression. Otherwise by
the time a man is forty-two, if he has lived his life joyfully, without
guilt, without any God, without any religion, just naturally, flowing
with nature with a deep relaxation, in a let-go ... by the time he is
forty- two he will become aware that these pleasures were very
momentary.</p><p>And now death is approaching, he has to find something more
eternal.</p><p>These pleasures will have indicated the way to him, that if in a
sexual orgasm, time and mind stop and you feel as if you are part of
eternity ... you disappear as an ego and you become simply one with the
whole. It happens only for a moment, but it can happen ... on your own
if you can manage to go beyond the mind and beyond time -- no need for a
woman, no need for a man. Every man, every woman is capable of going
beyond. Once you know it is possible, then you can manage it.</p><p>That's what meditation is -- just getting beyond the mind and beyond
time, and you have entered into eternal silence, into eternal life. And
once you have tasted that life your whole existence becomes a
celebration.</p><p>Question 2</p><p>The second question:</p><p>WOULD YOU AGREE WITH STENDHAL WHEN HE SAYS, "GOD'S ONLY EXCUSE IS
THAT HE DOES NOT EXIST"?</p><p>Absolutely!</p><p>If God existed, he would have been murdered long ago. Man could not
have tolerated him; he was an enemy. It is good that he does not exist,
so you can go on praying ... Just think .…</p><p>There is a story, a very ancient story .…</p><p>Once God used to live just in the marketplace, but the whole day,
even in the night people were knocking on the doors and complaining
about everything: "This is not the right kind of world you have created.
Why is there so much sickness? If you are the creator, then why do you
create bodies which are sick? Why is there old age, and why is there
death?"</p><p>So people tortured him so much, the old story says, that he called a
council of his angels and asked them, "I will either die out of this
constant torture, or I will have to commit suicide! Can you tell me what
I should do? These people don't leave me for a single moment and their
demands are such that I cannot fulfill them. One woman comes and she
says, `Tomorrow, remember, no rain because I am trying to dry my wheat.'
And another man says, `Tomorrow I absolutely need rain because I am
sowing my seeds.' Now what am I to do?</p><p>"And there are millions of people shouting and angry because their
desire has not been fulfilled, their prayer has not been heard."</p><p>So the angels thought. One angel said, "It is good if you move to
Everest, the highest peak of the Himalayas."</p><p>God said, "You don't know it but I am omniscient, I know everything
-- past, present, future. Soon there will be a man who will reach to the
highest peak of the Himalayas.</p><p>And once one man has found me, there will be buses and airplanes, and
all kinds of vehicles. And they will make roads and hotels, and again
there will be the marketplace.</p><p>You don't understand: it will only be just a little peace for a short
time. That won't do. I will have to change my place again."</p><p>So somebody suggested, "Why don't you move to the moon?"</p><p>He said, "You don't understand because you don't know the future --
just after Everest they are going to go to the moon. So I will have to
change again. Show me something from where I have not to change!"</p><p>Then an old angel came close to him and whispered in his ear, "The
only place man may never think of is within his own heart. You just sit
there ..."</p><p>He has disappeared from everywhere. Perhaps you can encounter
something of divineness in your own being. In your own life you may find
something which is godly.</p><p>You will not find God as a person, you will find a quality, a
fragrance, a presence; a certain air, a certain energy which is not
yours, which belongs to the cosmos.</p><p>Stendhal is perfectly right: "God's only excuse is that he does not
exist." That is saving him; otherwise there was no safety, no
security.</p><p>Friedrich Nietzsche in his, THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA, comes to a point
where Zarathustra is coming down from his mountain cave where he has
lived many, many years. And he finds on the way an old hermit's hut, and
the hermit is praying to God.</p><p>Early in the morning, as the sun is rising, the hermit is
praying.</p><p>And Zarathustra murmurs to himself, "Is it possible that this old
hermit has not heard that God is dead?"</p><p>When Zarathustra goes down he tells the crowd, "Have you heard the
news that God is dead?" They all start laughing.</p><p>They say, "You must be insane. Living in a cave for many, many years
alone, has made you a crackpot."</p><p>Nietzsche himself became mad in the last phase of his life, because
he declared really good news but he could not manage to find something
to replace God. He could not find the celebration of life, he could not
find the experience of the living stream within you.</p><p>He remained in a vacuum -- in a vacuum you are going to be mad.</p><p>More people go mad in the West than in the East. More people commit
suicide in the West than in the East. More people murder in the West
than in the East. It should be otherwise -- the East is so poor that
people should commit suicide, should go mad ... but they don't. What is
happening?</p><p>The Western mind has come to know God is not there -- an immense
vacuum.</p><p>And man cannot live without meaning, man cannot live without
significance, man cannot live without joy. If God is dead, man has
become absolutely empty, and man cannot live in emptiness.</p><p>He needs juices of life flowing through him. He needs to blossom into
beautiful lotuses.</p><p>He needs to sing songs, he needs to play music. He needs all the
blessings that existence makes available to you.</p><p>The Western man is more educated, is more rich, hence his bodily
needs are almost fulfilled. He looks at the sky and finds the sky is
empty -- there is no God. This understanding that there is no God,
rather than becoming good news to the Western man has become bad news.
He feels accidental, unnecessary -- there is no reason why he should be
here.</p><p>The East knows three religions which don't have any God -- Jainism,
Buddhism, Taoism</p><p>-- three religions which are not centered on God. And these three
religions seem to be saner than the religions which have come out of
Judaism -- Judaism, Christianity, Mohammedanism. These three Eastern
religions seem to be more sane, because from the very beginning there is
no God. So they don't have to look upward in the sky, they have to look
inward. That is the only place where they have to explore for truth.</p><p>Prayer is not the way; meditation is the way.</p><p>And those who have come to the ultimate experience of meditation -- a
Gautam Buddha, a Bodhidharma, a Mahakashyapa, a Mahavira, a Lao Tzu, a
Chuang Tzu, a Ma Tzu, a Sekito ... they all don't even talk about God.
That which does not exist -- what is the point even to say that he does
not exist? It is simply out of the question to discuss God, to discuss
heaven and hell.</p><p>Hence I want you to understand that Zen has come as a flowering out
of the meeting of Gautam Buddha and Lao Tzu. It is the meeting of Dhamma
and Tao. It is a crossbreed of Bodhidharma and Chuang Tzu. These two
religions have reached to the highest peak, and they are unorganized
religions. Where they have become organized they are dead. For example,
in Tibet it became organized, it became dead. In Sri Lanka it became
organized, it became dead.</p><p>Wherever religion becomes organized it becomes dead because it is
immediately a desire for power, a desire to dominate. It becomes
politics instead of religion.</p><p>Organization destroys the individual, sacrifices the individual, and
the individual is the only one who can know the highest peaks of
consciousness and the depths of consciousness.</p><p>Out of the meeting of Gautam Buddha and Lao Tzu, Zen is born. Zen is
neither Buddhism, nor is it Tao; it is both, just as you are both your
mother and your father. You are neither -- something of your father,
something of your mother is flowing in you.</p><p>Zen has come to the highest point of expression. It has become almost
synonymous with eternal life. Adam and Eve could not eat the fruit of
the eternal life, they were expelled from the Garden of Eden. They had
only eaten the fruit of knowledge. But Zen gives you the other tree, the
tree of eternal life.</p><p>So in this series we will be discussing Zen, as equivalent to eternal
life. God is no where.</p><p>Life is now here.</p><p>And Zen is the master key to open the doors of the mystery of life.
The sutra:</p><p>OUR BELOVED MASTER, SEKITO SAID:</p><p>MY TEACHING, WHICH HAS COME DOWN FROM THE ANCIENT BUDDHAS, IS</p><p>NOT DEPENDENT ON MEDITATION OR ON DILIGENT APPLICATION OF ANY</p><p>KIND.</p><p>The word `meditation' here may give you a feeling of
misunderstanding, of</p><p>confusion, because in English there are three words: concentration,
contemplation, meditation. None of these three words is capable of
translating the Sanskrit word dhyana, which became in Buddha's language
-- he used Pali, a different language from Sanskrit -- zhana. And when
Bodhidharma took the message to China, from zhana it became ch'ana. And
when Rinzai took the message from China to Japan, from ch'an or ch'ana,
it became zen. It came closer to Buddha's zhan or zhana.</p><p>But there is no equivalent word in English, because even the word
`meditation' gives the idea that you are meditating upon something.
Concentrating upon something, contemplating about something, meditating
upon something -- but dhyan, or zen, are without any object.</p><p>Zen means neither are you contemplating nor are you concentrating,
nor are you meditating, because there is no object. You simply are --
silent, no thought, no mind.</p><p>It is because of this, Sekito includes meditation also: "One does not
need meditation or a diligent application of any kind to become the
enlightened one."</p><p>But for your understanding and clarity, when I use the word
`meditation' -- it is a poor word, it does not have the same quality as
`dhyan' or `zen' -- I use it because there is no other word in the
English language.</p><p>And there is a reason why there is no other word -- the West never
came to the point of dhyana. It never came to the point where one simply
is -- neither doing anything outwardly nor doing anything inwardly. One
simply is -- a pure isness, an utter silence.</p><p>That brings you to your very center, and the moment you are at the
very center you start growing into a buddha, into an enlightened one.
Your awareness for the first time opens its petals the way a lotus opens
its petals when it is daybreak when the sun starts rising, when the
night is over.</p><p>Sekito is right: no special discipline is needed. No special
application of any kind is needed. No mind effort is needed -- that's
what he means by meditation. What you need is just to leave everything
aside. Transcend the body, the mind, the heart. Just go on transcending
till you come to a point which is the end of the road. There -- you
simply are.</p><p>Basho says:</p><p>SITTING SILENTLY DOING NOTHING, SPRING COMES --</p><p>AND THE GRASS GROWS BY ITSELF.</p><p>You don't have to do anything, you have just to sit silently doing
nothing, because any kind of doing is going to take you away from
yourself. When you are not doing anything, the whole energy gathers
inside; it is not invested anywhere. The moment you pass your mind, all
the energy that was invested in thoughts is released. When you pass your
heart, all the energy that was invested in your emotions, feelings,
sentiments, is released.</p><p>Now you are becoming too full of energy. This abundance of energy
gives you the first taste of existence, and as this energy becomes a
pillar of tremendous height and depth, you have found the connection
with the cosmos. You are no longer alone. In fact, you are no more, only
existence is. Then the existence, the cosmos, the life, is a sheer
dance.</p><p>I teach you to be dancers. I teach you to be lovers.</p><p>I am absolutely life affirmative, and your all religions are life
negative.</p><p>I am utterly devoted to the present moment. Don't move into the past
because that is memory; there is no relevant existence to your memory
anymore. Don't move into the future because that is only
imagination.</p><p>Just remain here, and you will be surprised. If you are just now
here, all thoughts disappear, because all thoughts are either of the
past or of the future. No thought is of the present.</p><p>The present is so pure, so clean, so clear, just an opening into the
cosmos. This is Zen, and this is the key to enter into life eternal. The
very feel of life eternal takes all tensions, anxieties of old age, of
sickness, of death, and birth away from</p><p>you.</p><p>You have never been born and you will never die. It is the body that
has been changing.</p><p>You have been changing houses. But you are the reality, the
truth.</p><p>The truth is not outside you, it is at the innermost hidden
center.</p><p>So Zen simply means doing nothing, just being. And in that utter
silence of being, you slowly slowly relax, and the spring comes and the
grass grows by itself. You suddenly start blossoming -- your eyes start
having a new depth. Your gestures start having a new grace -- your every
act becomes sheer joy. It may be just chopping wood, it may be just
carrying water from the well -- it doesn't matter.</p><p>Once you know you are not accidental to existence, once you know you
are existence itself, life takes a tremendous quantum leap. You are no
longer confined to the body, you are no longer confined to the small
mind. You become vast and infinite, and only in this vastness and
infinity can you rejoice, can you be blissful.</p><p>And this vastness has become available to you because God is dead;
otherwise he was occupying every place, he was watching you from every
side. He was judging you continuously, poking his nose into your
affairs, condemning you -- "This is wrong, don't do it." And all his
commandments were against life.</p><p>I have heard an old story .…</p><p>When God made the world he went with his commandments to the
Babylonians first, and asked them, "Would you like to have a
commandment?"</p><p>They said, "First, we would like to know what the commandment is."
And he said, "Thou should not commit adultery."</p><p>They said, "Forget all about it. Without adultery there is no joy in
life. Just take</p><p>your commandments."</p><p>God was very much disappointed, "What kind of people are these?" He
went to the Egyptians ... the same question.</p><p>"What are the commandments? First we have to know it before we take
one" -- and nobody was ready to take it.</p><p>And then he found Moses who asked a wrong question. When God said,
"Would you like to have a commandment?" Moses said, "How much? How much
does it cost?"</p><p>God said, "It is free."</p><p>Moses said, "Then why one? I will have ten."</p><p>But when God is no longer there, all his commandments disappear and
all his holy scriptures disappear, and the world becomes one for the
first time. No religions, no religious boundaries, no discrimination --
without God, humanity is one.</p><p>Zen teaches you not only to be one with humanity, but to be one with
the trees and the rivers, and the mountains and the sky and the stars.
This whole universe is our being. We are just flowers of different
colors giving a beautiful variety to existence. We are expressions of
existence, unique expressions. That gives you pride, that gives you
dignity. That gives you an intrinsic honor, a self-respect which you
were not able to have if God was alive.</p><p>But the whole of humanity has not heard even yet. They are still
praying to a fiction, and that fiction is making the whole humanity
schizophrenic, neurotic, obscene, ugly.</p><p>Three rabbis were sitting on a park bench one evening .…</p><p>They used to come to that park every evening -- old rabbis. One was
seventy- five, one was eighty-five, one was ninety-five -- all
retired.</p><p>The youngest rabbi who was seventy-five looked very sad. The second
rabbi who was eighty-five asked him, "What is the matter? Why are you so
sad this</p><p>evening?"</p><p>He said, "What to do? I have to tell you so that I can be unburdened.
It happened that a beautiful lady was a guest in my house, and when she
was taking a bath I looked through the keyhole at her beautiful
proportionate body."</p><p>Both the rabbis started laughing.</p><p>The second rabbi said, "You idiot. Everybody does that in their
childhood."</p><p>But the youngest rabbi said, "You have not heard the whole story and
you have interfered. I was caught red-handed by my mother."</p><p>Those two rabbis said, "We know. Everybody gets caught. This is
nothing to be sad about."</p><p>But the man said, "You don't understand at all. This happened today!
It is not a question of childhood."</p><p>They said, "Then it is a serious matter."</p><p>"But it is nothing," the second rabbi said. "What is happening to me,
you don't know ..."</p><p>His problem was that he had not made love to his wife for three days.
And both the rabbis started laughing, because they both knew what his
"love" was. At the age of eighty-five, one leg in the grave, one leg out
-- what was his love? They already knew it, so they both laughed.</p><p>He said, "Why are you laughing?"</p><p>They said, "We are laughing at your love. Don't be worried about
it."</p><p>His love was, he would take the hand of the wife before going to
sleep, squeeze it three times, and say goodnight. That was his love.</p><p>But wives are wives, and even this much love the wife was not
allowing him for three days. She would turn and say, "I have a headache;
you just go to sleep."</p><p>So he said, "For three days she has had a headache. At exactly the
moment I try</p><p>to make love to her, she says, Ì have a headache; you just go to
sleep.'"</p><p>The third, the oldest rabbi said, "You are all idiots. You don't
understand real problems.</p><p>The real problem is happening to me. Just this morning when I was
going to make love to my wife she started screaming, Àre you a sex
maniac? The whole night you have been making love again and again and
again.'"</p><p>So he said to his friends, "It seems I am losing my memory. I thought
it was the first time."</p><p>A repressed humanity is going to have all these problems. But who has
created all these problems? Your God, your priests ... they are the
greatest criminals, because very piously they appear to be your
well-wishers, but they have destroyed everything in you.</p><p>Zen wants you to resurrect, to take hold of your life again, which
you have given to somebody else to be taken care of. Be a master, and
you will start blossoming flowers of beauty and blissfulness and
ecstasy, and a divine drunkenness.</p><p>Sekito says, "WHEN YOU ATTAIN THE INSIGHT AS ATTAINED BY THE BUDDHA,
YOU REALIZE THAT NO-MIND is BUDDHA ..." Just going</p><p>beyond the mind, and you have become a buddha. It is such a small
passage, so</p><p>small a journey --</p><p>perhaps a single step. But because you are not total, I tell you
about three steps. I divide one step into three steps, because you are
hesitant to take such a jump -- one step.</p><p>Otherwise there is only one step: from mind to no-mind. But because
you hesitate to go beyond the mind, you are afraid you may go insane.
That is true. If you go beyond the mind from the wrong door, you will be
insane.</p><p>There are two doors to go beyond the mind: one goes below the mind,
one goes beyond the mind. Both are outside the mind. If you enter from
the lower door, you will be insane, and you will be lying on a
psychiatrist's couch. If you enter the no-mind from the above door, you
will be a buddha. No buddha has ever suffered from any madness, any
neurosis, any psychosis -- nothing.</p><p>"WHEN YOU ATTAIN THE INSIGHT AS ATTAINED BY THE BUDDHA, YOU</p><p>REALIZE THAT NO-MIND is BUDDHA AND BUDDHA is NO-MIND" --</p><p>they are synonymous -- THAT NO-MIND, BUDDHA, SENTIENT BEINGS, bodhi,
AND klesa, ARE OF ONE AND THE SAME SUBSTANCE WHILE THEY VARY IN
NAMES.</p><p>Everything is made of the same stuff, the same existence, the same
consciousness of no-mind; only names differ. You can call it anything --
nirvana; you can call it salvation; you can call it liberation. But
these are different names of the same space which accurately described
is just no-mind, or beyond the mind. You appear in a space which has no
limits, no boundaries, and suddenly you become aware that your being has
been here since eternity, and it is going to be here forever.</p><p>This very no-mind is the buddha, and this very moment is the lotus
paradise. You don't have to go anywhere. You have to just sink inwards
to find the bottom of your being.</p><p>"YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT YOUR OWN NO-MIND ESSENCE IS NEITHER</p><p>SUBJECT TO ANNIHILATION NOR ETERNALLY SUBSISTING, IS NEITHER</p><p>PURE NOR DEFILED."</p><p>It is so pure that you cannot even call it pure, because it is never
defiled. Anything pure can be defiled, but it is so pure you cannot even
call it pure. It cannot be defiled, its purity is absolute. No dust ever
gathers on the mirror of your consciousness.</p><p>This makes a tremendous point. The sinner and the saint are both
capable to go into no-mind, because the sinner cannot defile his
no-mind, the saint cannot purify it. It is always beyond duality.</p><p>It is so pure and so innocent -- available to the sinner, available
to the saint. Both have to go beyond their mind. The sinner has to go
beyond the sinning mind, and the saint has to go beyond the saintly
mind. But both have to go beyond the</p><p>mind, and they reach to the same space of absolute purity. It is
transcendental to all dualities; it simply is. You cannot name it, you
cannot utter a single word about it.</p><p>One of the most important logicians of the West, Ludwig Wittgenstein,
has written in his great work, TRACTATUS LOGICO-PHILOSOPHICUS... he
wrote in a very strange and special style, the style that has been used
in the Zen people's sutras. He would only write in small stanzas and put
numbers. Every stanza, every line was complete in itself, made a
complete statement. So he would number -- not the pages, but he would
number the first sutra, the second sutra, the third sutra, the fourth
sutra ...</p><p>One of the maxims -- sutra means maxim, the smallest condensed
statement -- I came across when I was a student says: That which cannot
be said should not be said. A complete statement -- if you cannot say
anything about no-mind, then please don't say anything, because whatever
you say will be wrong. Whatever you say will not be exactly what you
wanted to say. So please don't say anything about that which is
inexpressible.</p><p>I wrote a letter to him, but he had died. His friend sent me the
reply: "If he was alive he would have accepted your amendment. He was a
man of tremendous honesty and he would not have thought that you were
criticizing him."</p><p>I was not criticizing. I was simply saying to him, "You are saying,
`That which cannot be said should not be said,' but you have said
something about it. Remove this maxim. Even to say this much is saying
something. That which cannot be said should not be said -- you have said
something about it." Nothing can be said about the no-mind, including
this sentence: Nothing can be said about no-mind.</p><p>It is a pure experience -- you can experience it. You can have it,
you already have it. You can dance with ecstasy when you come to
recognize that it has been always there, you just never looked at it.
You were so occupied outside, so involved in trivia that the essential
got lost. But it is there waiting.</p><p>"IT REMAINS PERFECTLY UNDISTURBED AND SELF-SUFFICIENT. THE SAME</p><p>IS SO WITH THE WISE AND THE IGNORANT."</p><p>They are made of the same stuff: no-mind -- the wise and the
ignorant. The</p><p>ignorant have not to become wise before they enter into no-mind. They
can enter into no-mind from every place they are -- the sinner, the
ignorant, the wise, the knowledgeable. Wherever you are, your distance
from no-mind is the same.</p><p>This is a grand rebellion against all religions. It does not say the
sinner has first to become a saint, the immoral has first to become a
moral person. Zen gives you a tremendous insight that wherever you are,
whoever you are, whatever your actions, nothing can defile, nothing can
make it disturbed. From your very space you move directly into no-mind.
From different spaces you move to the same center, and you will find
your being absolutely clean, utterly clean. It has never been
otherwise.</p><p>"YOUR NO-MIND ESSENCE IS NOT LIMITED IN ITS WORKING, AND IS NOT</p><p>INCLUDED IN THE CATEGORY OF MIND, CONSCIOUSNESS, OR THOUGHT.</p><p>"THE THREE WORLDS OF DESIRE, FORM, AND NO-FORM, AND THE SIX</p><p>PATHS OF EXISTENCE ARE NO MORE THAN MANIFESTATIONS OF YOUR</p><p>MIND ITSELF."</p><p>All your so-called disciplines, methods, yoga ... all your prayers,
are just gimmicks, projections of your own mind. Drop everything!</p><p>I am reminded of a great Catholic bishop .…</p><p>He had a beautiful parrot who used to recite the Catholic prayer
completely. It was a precious parrot. The parrot was shown to all the
guests, and he would recite the whole Catholic prayer. And he was such a
pious, saintly parrot. He was trained -- he used to have a rosary in one
hand, and he would go on saying, "Alleluia, Alleluia!" And everybody was
surprised that such a pious parrot ...</p><p>But he looked very sad, as every saint always looks -- you cannot
become pious without becoming sad. Because he was looking so sad, the
bishop was always worried what to do about it, because otherwise he was
absolutely normal.</p><p>One day he went to see one of the members of his congregation, a
woman, who had got a parrot just that day. And the parrot owner had told
her, "I don't want to sell this parrot to you. You can take any other
parrot. We have got many in our shop." But she became so interested in
the parrot -- it was a very beautiful specimen.</p><p>She said, "I will pay anything, but only for this parrot."</p><p>The man said, "I have to tell you that this parrot comes from a very
ugly place. He used to be in a whorehouse so he uses four-letter words.
That is why I am trying to prevent you from taking it."</p><p>But the lady said, "I will teach him, but I will take it." He was so
beautiful looking that she thought, "If he can speak four-letter words,
what is the problem? Just a little training will be needed." But it was
simply impossible. He would say anything in front of the guests, in
front of the neighbors. He would shout anything -- all kinds of obscene
words.</p><p>So when the bishop came for his weekly visit, she told him her
misery, "What to do? I have purchased this parrot ... so beautiful."</p><p>The bishop said, "Don't be worried. I have a very pious, saintly
parrot, who continuously goes on moving his beads on the rosary, has the
complete prayer and recites it so perfectly. I will take your parrot and
keep this parrot with my parrot in the same cage.</p><p>And he is such a saintly person he will teach this parrot." So he
took the parrot.</p><p>He put the parrot in the same cage, and he went in. As he came out,
he could not believe his eyes. The saintly parrot had dropped his rosary
and was sitting very close to the other parrot. And the bishop said,
"What happened? Why have you dropped your rosary? And why are you not
reciting Ave Maria or Alleluia?"</p><p>The parrot said, "I was praying for a woman, and I have got it. No
more rosary, no more prayer. I have got such a beautiful girlfriend. You
get lost!"</p><p>Your so-called saints and your so-called sinners are not much
different -- only their masks are different. And my experience is that
your sinners are more innocent than your saints. I have seen criminals,
I have seen murderers. I used to visit the jails, and then I was finally
jailed in America. I lived as an insider in</p><p>five jails, and I found such beautiful human beings, far more
beautiful than the politicians, than the priests -- utterly innocent
people.</p><p>Zen gives equal opportunity to sinners and saints, to the good and to
the bad, because its understanding is very clear. Its insight is so deep
that the distance from no-mind is equal.</p><p>So it does not matter what kind of things you have been involved in.
Whether you were doing things which people think are wrong, or whether
you were doing things which people think are right -- it does not
matter! Those were all your mind phenomena. Just go beyond the mind.
When the saint drops his mind, and the sinner drops his mind, they both
enter into the same space, the same buddhahood.</p><p>This is the great rebellion of Zen. And this gives you a totally
different kind of religiousness. This makes you dance, live with
totality with no inhibition, with no guilt, because wherever you are,
the moment you want to enter into your eternal life, you can take a
jump. From any point in existence, from any kind of personality, you can
drop that personality and move into utter silence.</p><p>No religion has that amount of guts; no religion has that amount of
courage -- Zen is really daring! It belongs only to the lions, not to
the sheep of Jesus Christ.</p><p>"THEY ARE ALL LIKE THE MOON REFLECTED IN WATER OR IMAGES IN THE</p><p>MIRROR."</p><p>If a saint comes in front of a mirror, the mirror does not bother
"that you are a saint." A sinner comes -- the mirror makes no
discrimination. The sinner is equal to the saint, to the idiot, to the
so-called great scholar.</p><p>The mirror mirrors equally. The no-mind is your mirror.</p><p>In front of the mirror everyone is equal.</p><p>Zen gives you a totally new concept of spiritual communism. All
religions are against communism, only Zen has the capacity to absorb
communism.</p><p>You may be an atheist, it does not matter. You may be a theist, it
does not matter.</p><p>The distance from no-mind is equal.</p><p>So I never ask you who you are. Whether you are an atheist, whether
you are a theist -- it is your business. Whether you are a communist or
an anarchist -- it is your business.</p><p>Whether you are a Christian or a Hindu or a Mohammedan, it does not
matter. What matters to me is whatever kind of mind you have make it the
jumping board and jump into the no-mind. No-mind knows no differences,
it is one cosmic whole. And to me, the man of no-mind is the only
religious man. All else is just pseudo.</p><p>He is saying, "THEY ARE ALL LIKE THE MOON REFLECTED IN WATER OR</p><p>IMAGES IN THE MIRROR. HOW CAN WE SPEAK OF THEM AS BEING BORN</p><p>OR AS PASSING AWAY?"</p><p>You are never born, you have always been here. You have always been
in the space, in the time, here and now; you will never die. Death and
birth, are both superficial episodes in a long eternal life -- small
things; they don't matter.</p><p>"WHEN YOU COME TO THIS UNDERSTANDING YOU WILL BE FURNISHED</p><p>WITH ALL THE THINGS YOU ARE IN NEED OF."</p><p>I have been telling you again and again that you don't need any
morality, you don't need any discipline. But if you come to the no-mind,
all that you ever needed will be furnished. You will become immensely
compassionate. You will have the grace which is almost not of this
world. You will have love without any conditions. You will share your
joy, your blessings, to all and sundry -- not only to friends, but also
to strangers. You will become just like a rain cloud which goes on
showering without bothering whether it falls on the stones, or on
the</p><p>road, or on the roof, or in the field, or in the garden. When you
have abundance, who cares? You simply go on sharing. Anybody who is
receptive will take it, who is not receptive will not take it. But that
is not your problem.</p><p>A buddha is choicelessly good. It is not that he is practicing a
certain morality, following certain commandments. It is simply that he
cannot do anything wrong. His consciousness, his light is so clear that
he can see exactly what is good. He knows the good is a reward in
itself, not that you will have a reward in heaven. And the bad is a
punishment in itself, not that you will have a punishment in hell. So
there is no heaven, no hell.</p><p>Every action brings its joy or its misery. A man with clear eyes can
see. And I don't think anybody is going to choose misery, is going to
choose pathology, is going to choose something ugly and obscene. If you
have eyes, you will choose -</p><p>- the most beautiful, the most glorious, the most majestic. It will
come spontaneously.</p><p>Gyodai wrote a haiku:</p><p>FOR MY SAKE,</p><p>DO NOT LIGHT THE LAMP YET, THIS EVENING OF SPRING.</p><p>These small haikus are as beautiful as small dewdrops on the lotus
leaves in the early morning sun. They shine more than diamonds, more
than pearls.</p><p>"For my sake ..." It is a beautiful evening of spring. Slowly, slowly
the darkness is coming. The sun is setting, the birds are returning to
their trees. The fragrance of the flowers is all around. The flowers of
the night are opening their petals.</p><p>Darkness has its own beauty; it is very clean, and it makes every
separation disappear.</p><p>Everything becomes one. Darkness has a depth which light misses.
Darkness has a silence which light does not have.</p><p>So when the darkness is descending, and he can smell the night
flowers opening, and the birds coming back to the trees making beautiful
sounds, he says, "For</p><p>my sake, do not light the lamp yet" -- don't disturb this beautiful
spring evening -</p><p>- "this evening of spring." Let me rest, let me watch this
transformation from light into darkness.</p><p>Light is very superficial, darkness has depth. Light comes and goes,
darkness remains.</p><p>You don't have to bring it in; you can't push it out. You cannot do
anything with darkness directly, you can do only something with the
light. You bring the light in -- darkness disappears. You take the light
out -- darkness comes in. In fact it never went anywhere; it was there,
the light just covered it. When the light is gone, darkness is left.</p><p>Light is momentary because it depends on fuel. And fuel -- even the
fuel of the sun one day is going to be finished, because it is giving so
much light, radiating every moment. It is becoming poorer every moment.
Scientists think that it will take at least four million years for the
sun to die. But in the eternity of existence, four million years don't
matter.</p><p>Every day some suns are exhausted, become old, dead, finished. The
physicists say they enter into black holes, they disappear. And every
moment, as suns are disappearing, new suns are being born. Science has
not yet discovered white holes. I think if there are black holes there
must be white holes. If black holes pull stars and planets and they
disappear, they die, then perhaps on the other side is a white hole from
which after some time of rest</p><p>-- maybe nine months in the womb -- they come out, again born.</p><p>But nothing in existence dies. Everything goes on, and everything
gets tired. There is a moment to live and there is a moment to die. But
your essential being simply goes from action to no-action. And again
when it has gathered energy, it is rejuvenated, it becomes fresh; it
comes back again from a new womb.</p><p>Only a buddha never comes back. His death is final because he has no
desire left. It is the desiring mind that takes you into another womb.
Buddha, a man who has realized his no-mind, is completely empty of
desires, ambitions. Now there is no need for him to enter into another
womb and suffer nine months in a prison. Then getting out of the prison
is not a pleasure either. And the whole life again starts, the whole
round. The same journey, the same youth, the same romances, the same
failures, the same frustrations ... and the old age, and the fear</p><p>of death.</p><p>The interest of Zen is how to help you to get rid of this circle of
birth and death. The only way is going beyond the mind. It is the mind
that contains all your ambitions, desires, tensions, anguishes,
anxieties, angst. If you get out of it, you are the awakened one. You
have come to the point from where you can move into the cosmos directly.
You become part of the whole, or more accurately, you become the
whole.</p><p>Question 3 Maneesha's question:</p><p>OUR BELOVED MASTER,</p><p>IN HIS POEM, "SONG OF MYSELF," WALT WHITMAN WRITES:</p><p>"YOU SHALL POSSESS THE GOOD OF THE EARTH AND SUN ... YOU SHALL</p><p>NO LONGER TAKE THINGS AT SECOND OR THIRD HAND, NOR LOOK</p><p>THROUGH THE EYES OF THE DEAD, NOR FEED ON THE SPECTERS IN BOOKS</p><p>.…</p><p>"THERE WAS NEVER ANY MORE INCEPTION THAN THERE IS NOW, NOR</p><p>ANY MORE YOUTH OR AGE THAN THERE IS NOW, AND THERE WILL NEVER</p><p>BE ANY MORE PERFECTION THAN THERE IS NOW, NOR ANY MORE HEAVEN</p><p>OR HELL THAN THERE IS NOW."</p><p>BELOVED MASTER, FROM THE DEIFICATION OF A FICTION TO THE CELEBRATION
OF ONE'S SELF -- IS THIS NOT THE ESSENTIAL</p><p>DIFFERENCE</p><p>BETWEEN THE OLD AND THE NEW MAN?</p><p>Maneesha, it is exactly the difference between the old man who lived
under a slavery, and the new man who would have come out of the slavery
of God, of churches, of religions.</p><p>The old man never really lived, he followed borrowed knowledge. He
was always dictated to, dragged from this point to that point. The new
man will live out of freedom, spontaneity, awareness. He will not have
any scriptures, he will not have any dictators, he will not have any
gods. He will be himself the ultimate consciousness. This is real
growth.</p><p>And it is time, the right time! We have lived in slavery enough. Now
drop it ...in toto!</p><p>Move into an open sky. Open your wings, the whole existence belongs
to you.</p><p>The new man is going to be an emperor, in the sense that he will be
the master himself.</p><p>He will not allow any other master. He will not allow any other
slavery. He will not allow nations, he will not allow races, he will not
allow caste systems. He will not allow all kinds of religions and their
superstitions. The new man will be absolutely clean and fresh and
innocent like a child. And out of that innocence arises a divine being,
the buddha.</p><p>The buddha is the new man.</p><p>It is time for Sardar Gurudayal Singh. Put the light on!</p><p>Jerry and Judy Jam are sitting at breakfast one morning when Judy
sighs and puts down her toast.</p><p>"Darling," she says, "I have been thinking about that time when you
were shipwrecked.</p><p>All the newspapers called you a hero because you survived alone in
the Indian Ocean for three months on a life raft.</p><p>"And yet I feel, darling," continues Judy, "that you have been hiding
something from me ever since. What happened?"</p><p>"Well, dear," replies Jerry, trying not to look like Mickey Mouse,
"since you have been so wonderful to me, I must confess I am hiding
something from you! There was a lovely girl on that raft with me. We
were on that ship together when it sank. We were the only ones that
survived."</p><p>"A-ha!" cries Judy.</p><p>"It was not like that, dear," explains Jerry. "It is true, she was a
prostitute, but she saved my life! We had no food, no water -- all we
had was ourselves and our will to survive."</p><p>"I see," snaps Judy. "So what did you do?"</p><p>Jerry takes a long drink from his coffee cup and continues. "You have
to understand the conditions out there, dear. We had no food, no water.
All we had was our own naked bodies."</p><p>"You have already told me that!" interrupts Judy, sharply.</p><p>"We held each other tight," continues Jerry. "All we had was our
bodies -- naked under the burning sun."</p><p>Judy does not say a word. She just stares at him as though he is a
snake.</p><p>"All right! All right!" cries Jerry, as he cracks under the strain.
"You want to know the truth? We fucked! Yes! We screwed all the time! If
it had not been for that wonderful girl I would never have survived!
Believe me -- she saved my life!"</p><p>Slowly, Judy pours herself another cup of coffee. "I don't like it,"
she says. "But I suppose I will have to live with it. But just one
thing. Have you ever seen her again?"</p><p>"Just once, dear," replies Jerry. "I met her in Las Vegas last summer
at our sales</p><p>convention."</p><p>"And what was she doing?" snaps Judy, suspiciously. "The same thing,
dear," replies Jerry. "Still saving lives!"</p><p>On the Buckingham Palace lawn one afternoon, Prince Edward -- the
rather dim son of Queen Elizabeth -- is sitting reading PLAYBOY
magazine. He looks up at his brother, Prince Andrew, and asks, "Hey,
Andy, you've got brains: tell me -- what is a fox pass?"</p><p>Andrew thinks for a moment, and then says, "Oh, you mean, faux pas!
That's a French expression which means a social blunder."</p><p>Edward looks at Andrew blankly. "What do you mean, à social
blunder'?" asks the dim prince. "Give me an example."</p><p>"Well," explains Prince Andrew, "remember last Sunday when the
Archbishop of Canterbury came to lunch, and mother took him for a walk
in the rose garden?"</p><p>"Yes, I remember," says Edward. "What about it?"</p><p>"Just listen," continues Andrew. "Remember the archbishop pricked his
thumb on a thorn? It was bleeding a lot, so mother brought him into the
palace. They went into the bathroom together, and stayed there for a
long time. And when they came out, we all went for lunch. Do you
remember all that, Edward?"</p><p>"Sure, I remember," replies Edward.</p><p>"Now," continues Andrew, "do you remember, as I was just passing the
pudding to you, mother said, Àrchbishop, is your prick still throbbing?'
And then the archbishop replied,</p><p>`No, Your Majesty, the swelling has gone down since you massaged it
in the bathroom.'</p><p>"And then the pudding flew out of my hands and spattered all over
everybody, and you shouted out, `Shit!' Do you remember all that?"</p><p>"Yes, I remember!" cries Edward, excitedly.</p><p>"Well," says Prince Andrew, "when you shouted `shit' -- that was a
faux pas!"</p><p>One afternoon on the little Greek island of Crete, the local
theatrical group is performing the famous Greek drama, "Eat-a-Puss Rex."
Young Spiro Sphincter, an amateur Greek actor, gets a small part in the
play. He only has to come onto the stage, approach a beautiful girl
lying on a bed, and say the words: "I would love to kiss your lips and
steal away!"</p><p>But on the opening night Sphincter is really nervous. He comes onto
the stage, his knees shaking, he stumbles over to the girl in the bed,
and stutters, "I would love to kiss your ...</p><p>I would love to kiss your ..." but his mind goes blank. He tries
again.</p><p>"I would love to kiss your ..."</p><p>Suddenly, someone in the back jumps up and shouts out, "Pussy!"</p><p>Instantly, Old Mrs. Acreepolis, sitting in the audience, has a severe
stroke and falls over dead.</p><p>The next day at her funeral, in The Holy Orthodox Church of the
Blessed Bleeding Virgin, Bishop Cretin, who has now got only three old
ladies left in his flock, swears revenge!</p><p>"We have got to stamp out this kind of filth!" cries Cretin. "I am
going to put a stop to this moral decay!"</p><p>So that evening at the theater, Cretin is sitting at the side of the
stage with a loaded shotgun on his knee and a stick of dynamite in his
pocket, looking mean and menacing.</p><p>Sure enough, in the second act of the play, the young actor Sphincter
comes bounding onto the stage, stumbles over to the girl in the bed, and
announces, "I am going to kiss your ... I am going to kiss your ..." But
again his mind goes blank.</p><p>There is a ripple of light laughter from the audience, and
immediately Bishop</p><p>Cretin jumps to his feet and cocks his gun.</p><p>"All right, everybody," screams Cretin, "I will blow the head off the
first son-of- a-bitch who says `pussy'!"</p><p>Nivedano ... (Drumbeat) (Gibberish) Nivedano ... (Drumbeat)</p><p>Be silent, and close your eyes. Feel your bodies completely frozen.
This is the right moment for turning inwards.</p><p>Gather all your energy, your total consciousness, and rush towards
the center of your being which is just below the navel, inside. Two
inches below the navel .…</p><p>Rush inside with an urgency as if this is the last moment of your
life. Unless you have that urgency and intensity, you can never reach to
the center.</p><p>It is not far away, it is very close; it only needs intensity and a
deep feeling of urgency.</p><p>Faster and faster ... Deeper and deeper ...</p><p>As you are coming closer to your center, a great silence descends
over you like soft rain.</p><p>You can feel the coolness of it. A little more .…</p><p>And suddenly you find immense peace arising from the very center of
your being, surrounding you like incense.</p><p>Just a little more ...</p><p>And you will start feeling immensely calm, quiet, tranquil, blissful.
Just one step and you are at the center. The moment you reach to the
center you are almost drunk by the divine.</p><p>You disappear.</p><p>In place of you, there is sitting the image, the symbol of the
Eastern awareness, enlightenment, Gautam the Buddha.</p><p>It is your very nature.</p><p>Everybody is by his very birth a Gautam Buddha.</p><p>Very few people go deep enough to recognize it; they remain outside
their whole life.</p><p>You are the most fortunate people on the earth, who are trying to
reach to your innermost nature.</p><p>Being the buddha simply means being alert, aware, conscious. It means
you have become only a witness.</p><p>This word `witness' has to be remembered, because this is the only
quality that buddha is made of.</p><p>Witness that you are not the body; witness that you are not the mind
-- this is the way to transcend body and mind.</p><p>Witness, finally, that you are only a witness.</p><p>This is how one becomes a Gautam Buddha, the highest peak of
consciousness ever achieved.</p><p>A great ecstasy arises in you -- you have never known it before. You
are feeling in tune with the universe; your heartbeat has become
harmonious with the heartbeat of existence.</p><p>To make this witness deeper and more clear ...</p><p>Nivedano ... (Drumbeat)</p><p>Relax ... but go on remembering only one thing -- that you are a
witness, nothing else.</p><p>This is your transcendence.</p><p>And as your witnessing deepens, you start melting into the universe
as ice melts into the ocean.</p><p>Gautama the Buddha Auditorium is turning into an ocean of
consciousness -- ten thousand buddhas have become one oceanic
consciousness. We are separate on the periphery, but we are one at the
center. The center is the center of everyone.</p><p>At this moment, rejoice ... and gather all those fragrances that are
surrounding you -- the blissfulness, the ecstasy. Drink more and more
from this eternal current of your life. And persuade the buddha to come
with you -- he is your nature, he has to come with you. He has to become
your very day-to-day life; he has to express his grace in your actions,
in your words, in your silences of the heart.</p><p>That day, you will feel the most blessed person in existence when you
disappear and only buddha remains.</p><p>These I have called the three steps of enlightenment:</p><p>The first step, the buddha comes behind you as a presence -- very
solid, very tangible, you can feel it. You can feel its fragrance, you
can feel its power; it fills you with great cheerfulness.</p><p>The second step, the buddha comes in front of you; you become the
shadow. And slowly, slowly the shadow starts disappearing.</p><p>The third step, you are no more. Not even a shadow is left, only
buddha remains</p><p>-- a transparent consciousness, an eternal life. Those who come to
this experience are the real people who can celebrate life.</p><p>I celebrate myself.</p><p>And I want you all to celebrate yourself. Become a dance, become a
song.</p><p>Become a lotus, become a spring.</p><p>There is no religion and there is no God to prohibit you -- you are
free from all superstitions, you are free from all God-oriented
theologies, you are free from all rubbish that everybody in the world is
carrying within himself. Throw it out so that your inner world is
completely clean and ready to welcome the buddha.</p><p>Nivedano ... (Drumbeat)</p><p>Now come back. But come back as a buddha, with the same grace, the
same silence, the same peace, the same blissfulness. Sit down for a few
moments just to recollect the golden path that you moved on, the immense
opening that happened at your very center.</p><p>You found yourself so close to existence that it started flowing in
you. Its dance became your dance; its celebration became your
celebration. Its immensity, its grandeur, its splendor, became your
splendor.</p><p>And see, just behind you is the buddha, with all its transparency ...
utter silence</p><p>.…</p><p>This is the first step.</p><p>Soon you will be able to take the second step. You will become the
shadow, and buddha will become almost your very heart, your very
heartbeat.</p><p>At the third and final step you will not be any more. You will be
absent, and life will be present.</p><p>Then begins the celebration.</p><p>Unless life is a celebration you have lived in vain. Unless life
turns into a Gautam Buddha you have been wasting a tremendous
opportunity given to you by existence.</p><p>Okay, Maneesha? Yes, Beloved Master.</p><p>I Celebrate Myself: God Is No Where, Life Is Now Here Chapter #2</p><p>Chapter title: Ringing bells in your heart</p><p>14 February 1989 pm in Gautam the Buddha Auditorium Archive</p><p>code:</p><p>8902145</p><p>ShortTitle:</p><p>CELEBR02</p><p>Audio:</p><p>Yes Video:</p><p>Yes Length:</p><p>174</p><p>mins</p><p>OUR BELOVED MASTER,</p><p>WHEN DAITEN FIRST CAME TO SEKITO, THE MASTER ASKED HIM, "WHAT</p><p>IS YOUR NO-MIND?"</p><p>DAITEN REPLIED, "THE ONE WHO SPEAKS IS IT." AT THIS, SEKITO SHOUTED,
"KWATZ!" -- AND LEFT.</p><p>TEN DAYS LATER, DAITEN AGAIN CAME TO SEKITO AND ASKED, "THE</p><p>LAST ANSWER I SAID TO YOU WAS NOT NO-MIND. WHAT IS NO- MIND?"</p><p>SEKITO SAID, "WITHOUT RAISING EYEBROWS OR MOVING EYEBALLS, BRING YOUR
NO-MIND HERE."</p><p>DAITEN SAID, "THERE IS NO NO-MIND TO BE BROUGHT."</p><p>SEKITO SAID, "BASICALLY, NO-MIND IS. WHY DO YOU SAY NO-MIND IS</p><p>NOT? THAT IS THE WRONG STATEMENT."</p><p>AT THIS, DAITEN WAS GREATLY ENLIGHTENED.</p><p>Friends, first, a few questions. Question 1</p><p>The first question:</p><p>TO US, ARE THE WORDS `GOD' AND `NO-MIND' SYNONYMOUS?</p><p>No, not at all. God can never be synonymous with no-mind. God is
always there, far away. God has been always referred to by the word
`that' -- invisible, just a fiction. No-mind has been always referred to
as this.</p><p>No-mind is your reality, your ultimate nature; God was a mind-created
lie. No- mind is your truth, your splendor, your very universe. They
cannot be synonymous.</p><p>God does not exist; no-mind exists.</p><p>God is only a belief; no-mind is an experience. God has been the
cause of all your mental sickness.</p><p>No-mind is pure health, wholeness.</p><p>The moment you utter the word `God' you immediately start thinking of
him as a person, as a creator. No-mind is not a person; on the contrary,
your very personality disappears, only then does no-mind start
blossoming. No-mind is not a creator. It has always been here, and will
remain always here; it is always now. No-mind is your eternity, your
very source of life.</p><p>God was just an excuse to exploit humanity and to keep humanity in a
very subtle and invisible bondage. God has been your prison; no-mind is
your freedom. God has been in the hands of the priests, and the priests
are doing the ugliest job in the world, because their whole business
depends on a lie.</p><p>No-mind has no priests, it is simply there inside you. And once you
experience it, suddenly you become aware that no-mind is not your
property, it is not your monopoly.</p><p>The first experience appears to be that it is your no-mind, but soon
you become aware that the no-mind contains the whole universe, it
contains the whole existence.</p><p>God has always been an outsider. You cannot create anything if you
are not an outsider.</p><p>The Hindus refer to God as a potter, but the potter has to be outside
the pot, only then can he create it. If he is inside the pot, the pot is
already created. What is he doing inside the pot? The potter has to be
outside, only then can he create the pot. All religions have the same
idea in different symbols -- but God is an outsider.</p><p>If there is a God you are only creatures, created people. Without God
you are buddhas, uncreated people. God is the heaviest burden that man
has been carrying, and because of that there is no progress, there is no
evolution. The heavy burden, the chains, go on pulling you backwards.
They don't allow you to</p><p>move faster to the higher peaks of evolution.</p><p>God has to be completely demolished from your minds. It is an
absolute necessity and urgency. Once you drop God you will be surprised
how many other lies have simply disappeared. He is the source, the
foundation of all lies. Just watch God disappearing and you will see
heaven has disappeared, hell has disappeared, fear has disappeared,
dread, greed ... they are simply gone. God was the source. For the first
time you can breathe at ease.</p><p>God was judgmental; no-mind has no judgment. God was continuously
condemning you; no-mind is a blissful, ecstatic state. God is just
programmed into your mind.</p><p>In the Soviet Union they program differently. They program no-God,
but both are programs. The atheist does not know that there is no God,
nor does the theist know that there is a God. Both are belief systems
contrary to each other. But that does not mean that one is right and the
other is wrong. Both cannot be right, but both can be wrong -- and both
are wrong.</p><p>An authentic man will not accept any belief system either of atheist
or of theist. He will explore on his own what the truth is; he will not
like secondhand knowledge. You never think about it, but you would not
like to wear somebody else's shoes. You would not like to wear somebody
else's secondhand clothes. But your whole mind is secondhand, and not
only secondhand, in fact, your mind has been going from hand to hand to
hand for millions of years. Living with this mind is not living at
all.</p><p>Your mind is borrowed -- your life cannot be sincere and honest. Your
mind is borrowed</p><p>-- your morality cannot be truthful, it will only be hypocrisy. Out
of a borrowed mind, how can you manage any truthfulness, any sincerity,
any authenticity, any originality?</p><p>God is the oldest lie, and no-mind is a fresh original experience.
God is no where; no-mind is now here.</p><p>No-mind is equivalent to life, is equivalent to existence. God is
against life, God is against existence.</p><p>Can't you see all the religions are against life? They don't want you
to live. Anything that makes you joyous, anything that makes you really
alive -- they start crushing it, condemning it as a sin.</p><p>No-mind simply allows you to be natural. It gives you an opportunity
to be natural, to be relaxed, to be at ease -- no guilt, no inhibition,
no suppression. Nature is accepted in its totality, it becomes your very
heart, your very being.</p><p>There is no morality from outside. That outside God was creating all
things from outside, imposing on you. And everybody around the world is
carrying mountains of loads of beliefs, moralities, commandments. They
are all inventions of the mind.</p><p>No-mind is not an invention of the mind, it is a discovery. You don't
have to invent it, it is already here. You just have to be here also --
and the meeting, and the transformation.</p><p>And out of that meeting and transformation arises a totally new kind
of morality, a new kind of spontaneity, a new kind of natural grace, a
new love for existence, a new reverence for all that is here, for all
that surrounds you.</p><p>But everything that comes from your very innermost being is being
prevented by your God, by your priests, by your scriptures. They are
your enemies. You have to take it very clearly. Unless you understand
who are the obstacles, you will never reach to no-mind.</p><p>God is the biggest obstacle to no-mind.</p><p>Because of God, the God-oriented religions could not manage any kind
of meditation, because meditation goes inwards, and God is outside. And
because God is outside, all the God-oriented religions have invented
prayers.</p><p>Prayers are for the outside God, and nobody has seen that God. A few
people have pretended -- either they were lying or they were
hallucinating, but nobody has seen God.</p><p>It is one of the most unproved hypotheses. Don't carry with you
unproved hypotheses; they become very burdensome. As time passes they go
on gathering more weight. The weight becomes so heavy that you stop
growing. There is no space left for you to grow.</p><p>All kinds of rubbish, furniture, rotten ... surrounds you. You don't
have any space to move.</p><p>If God is there you don't have any empty space, you don't have any
empty sky. You don't have any possibility to evolve -- there is no
space. Where are you going to evolve? God is filling every place. That's
why religions insist that he is omnipresent. If he is omnipresent, then
there is no space left for you. If he is all over, then wherever you go
you will be struggling against God.</p><p>No-mind is a pure space. It simply gives you an opening which goes on
widening as your experience becomes ripe. Finally, you find there is
only pure space all around you, infinite and eternal -- and you can open
your wings. It is your home -- you can fly as high as you want. There is
no weight dragging you downwards, dragging you backwards. The experience
of weightlessness is synonymous with no-mind.</p><p>A strange Sufi story is .…</p><p>A Sufi mystic was staying in a disciple's home. But he used to pray
to God so loudly that the neighbors started complaining. In the middle
of the night he would start shouting so loudly -- you have to shout
loudly if you want to reach to an invisible God. You don't know where he
is. Nobody knows his telephone number, nobody knows his address.</p><p>Blindly, you are just raising your hands towards the sky, which never
answers because there is nobody to answer.</p><p>Looked at scientifically, people who are praying to God are
absolutely insane, neurotics, because they are praying to somebody who
is not there, and they are talking to somebody who has never been there.
No answer ever comes.</p><p>That Sufi used to shout loudly. Finally, the disciple decided that it
was better to keep him in the basement at night. So they arranged a bed
in the basement of the house, so he could pray as loudly as he desired
and nobody would be disturbed.</p><p>But in the middle of the night the whole neighborhood gathered, and
they said, "Why have you put him on the roof of your house?"</p><p>He said, "Roof? We have put him in the basement."</p><p>But they went up to the roof and he was there praying to God so
loudly. And when you are praying from the roof, naturally your sound
goes on waking all the neighbors.</p><p>The disciple asked, "How did you manage to go to the roof?"</p><p>The mystic said, "I had to, because from the basement God will not
hear me."</p><p>Mohammedans have great pillars around their mosque, high pillars they
call minarets.</p><p>And the priest goes to the high pillars, because if you pray from the
high pillars there is a possibility God may hear you.</p><p>Hindus have in their temples -- Tibetans also have them in their
temples -- different kinds of bells, gongs. Did you know their purpose
is to attract the attention of God? So you give a good beat on the gong
and God will listen to you. Then after giving the beat on the gong, or
the drums, or the bells, you can pray.</p><p>In the Hindu temple the bell is where you enter. And the bigger the
temple, the bigger the bell. The richer the temples, the bigger and
bigger the bells ... deafening sound. First you have to ring the bell to
wake up God for him to listen to you. But you don't know where he is.
Your gong, your bells are just resounding in the empty sky. There is
nobody to be wakened.</p><p>No-mind is a reality that you can experience, but for that no prayer
is needed. You don't have to look outside of you. You have to close your
eyes, and you have to look inwards without any idea of what you are
going to find. If you have any idea that this is what you are going to
find, then most probably you will imagine, and you will think you have
found it.</p><p>Go inwards without any prejudice, because all prejudices are part of
the mind. Your Jesus, your Krishna, your Rama -- all are part of your
mind. If you carry any prejudice with you, you remain confined to the
mind. If you want to transcend the mind and reach to the no-mind, which
is the ultimate consciousness, pure consciousness, the very essence of
existence ... But for that, prayer is not of help, nor are temples of
any help, nor are scriptures of any help.</p><p>No philosophy is needed, no system of beliefs is needed, no theology
is needed.</p><p>All that you need is to unload yourself of everything that has been
forced upon you.</p><p>Unload yourself. Unburden yourself.</p><p>Drop everything that has been given to you by your parents, by your
teachers, by your priests, by your leaders.</p><p>Drop everything that has come from outside. Throw it out!</p><p>And suddenly you will find your mind is giving way into no-mind. You
have only to drop the rubbish -- and God is part of the rubbish, the
heaviest part.</p><p>So there is no possibility of God and no-mind being synonymous.</p><p>Here, we are searching without any belief, without any hypothesis. We
are simply going into our subjectivity, into our interiority.</p><p>As far as I am concerned, this is the only temple: your body. As far
as I am concerned, your subjectivity -- silent, peaceful, just an empty
space -- is the very source you have come from, and is the very goal you
are going towards.</p><p>When the source and the goal meet, you are enlightened -- the whole
circle, the whole pilgrimage is complete. You have left the source as
ignorant, you have come back to the source again as innocent. You have
again become a child.</p><p>One birth is given by your parents, another birth you have to manage
by yourself. The second birth is the birth which matters. The first
birth is going to end up in death. The second birth is the beginning of
eternity: no death, no end, no beginning.</p><p>No-mind is the whole universe, and it is not possible to find this
no-mind by worshipping, by prayer, by believing. This mind needs you to
be completely cured from all past-oriented ideologies, from all
organized religions, from all scriptures, from all that has been forced
upon you. It is phony, it is plastic.</p><p>Real roses come on the bush from its interiority. You can hang
plastic roses on the bush, but they will not be fragrant, and they will
not be alive. And because they are not alive they are not going to die.
They will just hang there. They are already dead; they are
man-manufactured flowers.</p><p>God is a man-manufactured idea.</p><p>No-mind is not your idea. No-mind is not manufactured by man. No-mind
is a gift of existence. You can only be grateful, you can only be in
deep gratitude when you find no-mind. You will not find even a single
word to say to existence. Even saying "thank you"</p><p>will look very superficial.</p><p>In the West it is very formal, you even say "thank you" to your
mother, you thank your father -- not that you really mean it, it is just
part of formality.</p><p>In the East it is totally different. I have never thanked my father,
I have never thanked my mother. It is so superficial, it is so formal.
When you love someone you cannot utter the words `thank you'. It will
destroy the whole beauty of the experience.</p><p>So when you come to no-mind, you are utterly dumb.</p><p>Kabir has made a statement. He says the experience of no-mind is
gunge keri sarkara --</p><p>as if the dumb man has tasted the sugar. He cannot speak. He knows
taste, but he is dumb; he cannot speak.</p><p>The experience of no-mind is inexpressible. You can have it, you can
dance in celebration but you cannot say anything about it. Your dance
certainly will shine with a new joy, with a new ecstasy, with a new
drunkenness. Your dance will show a new radiation, a new aura around
you. Your eyes will be shining. For the first time they have seen
something worth seeing. Your whole being will be throbbing with joy,
because you have come back to the original source.</p><p>Let gods die. Don't carry on them. People are carrying dead gods, and
when somebody is dead and you go on carrying him, you start stinking.
All religious people stink because they are carrying a dead body.</p><p>There is a beautiful Hindu mythology .…</p><p>Shiva, one of the gods of the Hindus, one of the three gods, the
trinity of Hinduism ...</p><p>Shiva's wife dies, but he won't accept the death of his wife. His
mind was constantly telling him, "If you go around the country there may
be somebody who can resurrect her."</p><p>He used to live in the Himalayas, so he came down with the dead body
of Parvati, his wife. The very word parvati means daughter of the
mountains ... a beautiful woman, but dead. He carried the corpse around
the country, asking everybody, "Is there any physician, any man of
miracles?"</p><p>The body was deteriorating, and soon it started falling into pieces.
The legs dropped in one place, the hands dropped into another place ...
Hindus have twelve holy places. Those twelve holy places in the country
are the twelve places where Parvati's parts dropped. But even though
parts were dropping, Shiva continued around the country until he found
that the last part had dropped. It must have taken him years.</p><p>But your carrying a dead God is a longer pilgrimage -- millions of
years. And you go on believing that someday, somewhere, God will
materialize. Meanwhile you go on carrying the corpse. The corpse is
destroying you also, because it is rotten, and it is making a rotten
humanity.</p><p>God is a sickness; you have simply to drop it. But the only good
thing is that you are carrying the sickness, so you can drop it. It is
your belief, so you can throw it out! It is not something that is a part
of you, it is something that you are holding unnecessarily. It is not
holding you! This is the only beautiful thing about it -- that you can
drop God.</p><p>One day I dropped God, and since then I have felt so weightless, so
blissful. I used to carry the dead body myself, but I realized that the
body was dead -- no breathing, no heartbeat -- it was up to me whether
to carry it or drop it. And as I dropped it, for the first time I felt
myself as an individual. The dead body was overwhelming me, it was
covering me from all the sides. It had become my personality.</p><p>For a moment I felt naked, because the personality had dropped, the
masks had</p><p>dropped.</p><p>But soon I knew that this nudity, this nakedness was natural.
Everybody is nude behind the clothes. The moment you drop your clothes
... Have you ever felt a certain freedom just on the seabeach as you
drop your clothes? You suddenly feel the sun with your body, the wind
blowing on your body, and a tremendous sense of freedom -- just by
dropping clothes, which are not of much weight.</p><p>God is very heavy. It goes on becoming heavier and heavier as time
passes. A moment comes when it is heavier than you -- you are crushed
under the mountainous load. Unless one is free from God, one knows not
what freedom is.</p><p>So God cannot be synonymous with no-mind.</p><p>No-mind is really the antidote to the disease called God. No-mind is
your freedom.</p><p>All chains dropped, all thoughts dropped, all feelings dropped ...
suddenly you find only the purest essence has remained. All that was
covering it, layer upon layer, has been dropped. This dropping I call
meditation.</p><p>Finally only a witness, a sakshi, remains -- just a pure awareness.
This is ultimate freedom, and the authentic religion is for ultimate
freedom and ultimate liberation.</p><p>God-oriented religions cannot even give you a sense of freedom, or a
direction for freedom. Their whole effort is to direct your mind towards
God. Fill your mind with God, repeat his name again and again so it
becomes ingrained in your mind. The more ingrained it becomes, the more
difficult it will be to leave it. The sooner you leave God, the better.
And you will have to leave one day, so why not now! One cannot live a
lie forever. Only truth can be lived forever.</p><p>You have to believe only in lies, you don't have to believe in the
truth. Truth has to be discovered. I teach you purely the attitude of an
agnostic -- one who does not believe, who does not disbelieve, but who
is a seeker, a searcher, an explorer.</p><p>Certainly the first thing to be explored is your own inner being.
That is the closest life throbbing, everything else is a little far
away. The man of intelligence first will look inside his own house
before he goes searching on the moon and on</p><p>Mars. First he will look inside to see what is there. And those who
have gone inside have never come empty handed. They have come with so
much bliss, so much ecstasy, with such an abundance that they start
sharing, because as they share they come to understand the inner
economics.</p><p>The more you share the more you have. If you don't share, you won't
have even that which you had. Jesus says, "Those who have shall be given
more, and those who have not, even whatsoever they have will be taken
away." I cannot agree with him. I say unto you, the more you give, the
more you will have; the less you give, the less you will have.</p><p>If you don't give at all, you won't have anything left. Sharing is
the only compassion.</p><p>Sharing is the only service.</p><p>Sharing is the only way the awakened one lives. That is real
character. That is authentic morality. That is true religiousness.</p><p>You don't have a God, but you become godly. Hence I say, the moment
you drop God you are moving in the right direction of becoming godly.
You will be divine in your ecstasies, in your silent spaces of the
being. You will be divine. But you will be divine because you will be
participating in the divine existence. Everything is sacred to the man
who has come to know himself, who has discovered his hidden secret of
life. Everything becomes sacred.</p><p>A story is told about the mystic Nanak .…</p><p>He went to Kaaba, the holy place of the Mohammedans. It is a
beautiful story.</p><p>He reached Kaaba by the evening, but his fame had already reached, so
people were waiting for him. They received him, welcomed him, but he was
very tired. So he said, "I would like to go to sleep, I have been
walking miles and miles."</p><p>So they prepared a bed under a tree, but he turned the bed.
Mohammedans don't sleep with their legs towards Kaaba, but he turned the
bed so that his legs were towards Kaaba, and his head was on the
opposite side.</p><p>When the head priest of Kaaba heard about it, he came running. He
said, "We</p><p>thought you were a great mystic, but you don't even seem to be
religious. You don't understand that you are hurting our feelings. You
are keeping your feet towards the most divine and the most holy land!
You should turn your feet."</p><p>Nanak laughed. He said, "As far as I am concerned, wherever I turn my
feet I find they are towards the holy land, because to me the whole
existence is holy. Now if you think there is some place which is unholy,
please turn my legs. I am willing!"</p><p>There was a silence. The priest could not say that there was some
place that was unholy.</p><p>But this could not be tolerated either, that this man continued to
keep his feet towards Kaaba.</p><p>I think up to this point it is factual. Beyond this point it becomes
more and more symbolic. But even that is significant .…</p><p>Finally, the priest decided to turn his legs and turn his head
towards Kaaba. But they were utterly disappointed, surprised. They could
not believe their eyes. Wherever they moved Nanak's legs, Kaaba
moved.</p><p>This must be symbolic, but it is significant. It is poetry, but it
gives you the feeling that if everything is holy and sacred it does not
matter where you keep your legs it will always be towards the sacred
land. The whole existence is sacred for a mystic. Nanak showed his
understanding very clearly. Only a man of no-mind can do that.</p><p>A man of no-mind knows that everywhere life is throbbing -- in the
trees, in the rivers, in the mountains ... Even the Himalayas are still
growing. It is the youngest mountain in the whole world, but really
powerful because it has got the highest peaks in the world and they are
still growing -- one foot per year. But that means it is alive, it is
not a dead mountain. It is reaching towards the stars, perhaps very
slowly because it is not a small mountain. And for mountains, even to
rise one foot in one year is quite fast. Looking at eternity, if the
Himalayas go on growing in this way, soon they will be touching stars;
it won't be long.</p><p>When you see life everywhere, in the stones -- perhaps fast asleep so
that you cannot feel it, perhaps a different dimension -- in the trees,
so that you cannot understand it ... But everything is so abundantly
alive, all that you need is space</p><p>and perceptivity of no-mind.</p><p>God is your blindness. No-mind is going to give you fresh eyes to
look again at the universe.</p><p>Question 2</p><p>The second question:</p><p>NIETZSCHE MADE THE OBSERVATION THAT WHEN "ORDINARY PEOPLE"</p><p>ARE IN AN UNPLEASANT SITUATION, "THEY ALWAYS SEEK TO GET OUT OF</p><p>IT WITH THE SMALLEST EXPENDITURE OF INTELLIGENCE."</p><p>IS GOD SIMPLY THE FIRST AND LAST RESORT OF A RETARDED HUMANITY?</p><p>Yes, absolutely yes. God is the invention of the retarded, of the
idiots, of the imbeciles, of the people who want a shortcut so they
don't have to exert any intelligence. God is the belief of the
unintelligent. God is the belief of the unconscious. God is the belief
of those who are still asleep and dreaming. The moment you wake up, all
dreams disappear, and with the dreams your God will also disappear.</p><p>No-mind is waking up from the sleep of the mind. No-mind is a
sunrise.</p><p>Mind has been a long long dark night, and no-mind blossoms into
tremendous intelligence, not intellect. Intellect is part of the mind,
intelligence is part of no- mind. It is a totally different phenomenon.
And when that fire of intelligence rises in you in great flames, you
don't find any God anywhere, but you certainly find everything is sacred
because everything is alive.</p><p>So a great reverence for life -- that's what I teach you. But you
will know life only when you have touched your own life. Then you will
know the criterion for what is alive. Right now you don't know the
criterion for what is alive.</p><p>Question 3</p><p>The third question:</p><p>THROUGH MY OWN RECENT ENCOUNTER WITH DEATH, I CAME ACROSS</p><p>MANY STORIES OF PEOPLE FROM DIVERSE CULTURES AND OF DIFFERENT</p><p>RELIGIOUS BACKGROUNDS, WHO TEMPORARILY LEFT THEIR BODIES AND</p><p>APPEARED TO OBSERVERS TO BE DEAD. THEY REPORTED SEEING A "BEING</p><p>OF LIGHT," WHICH WAS TOTALLY LOVING AND COMPASSIONATE.</p><p>COULD THIS "BEING OF LIGHT" BE THE BASIS ON WHICH THE CONCEPT OF</p><p>GOD HAS BEEN CREATED?</p><p>No, not at all. This experience is authentic. It happens sometimes to
people who have almost died -- not completely, but almost. They see a
luminous being. It is their own being, it is not God. In meditation you
will encounter the same luminous being without dying.</p><p>Meditation is a kind of death. You are separated from the body, you
are separated from the mind -- that's what death does. You are separated
from the body, you are separated from the mind. Suddenly you become
aware of a luminous being, which you think is separate from you because
you have never seen such an experience before. If you have been a
meditator, you would have recognized -- "This is me."</p><p>You are a light, luminous body inside this body -- a flame, an
eternal flame of light. But those who have almost died and come back to
life, because they don't have any experience of meditation, they think
they have seen something, a luminous being. They remember it vaguely,
faintly, a faraway echo, but they remember it. They have seen something
luminous. Naturally they cannot</p><p>conceive that they have seen themselves.</p><p>God is not based on the experience of people who were almost dead and
have come back again to life. But meditation knows exactly what has been
happening to these people --</p><p>they have encountered themselves. But because the encounter was for
the first time, and so quick ... just like a flash it came and went
away, and they were back to life. Naturally they think they have seen
some object, some person standing there with a radiant, luminous body,
because they have known only objects in their lives. They have never
known the subject.</p><p>A meditator will not commit such a mistake. A meditator will
recognize immediately --</p><p>whether alive or dead -- that he is the luminous eternal light. The
sutra:</p><p>OUR BELOVED MASTER,</p><p>WHEN DAITEN FIRST CAME TO SEKITO, THE MASTER ASKED HIM, "WHAT</p><p>IS YOUR NO-MIND?"</p><p>DAITEN REPLIED, "THE ONE WHO SPEAKS IS IT." AT THIS, SEKITO SHOUTED
"KWATZ!" -- AND LEFT.</p><p>Daiten is not yet enlightened, but he must have been a great scholar.
He has read in the scriptures that the no-mind is the one from where all
that is original comes out. When a buddha speaks, he is not speaking
borrowed words. His speaking is coming from no-mind. No-mind is flowing
in his words, hence the beauty.</p><p>The same ordinary words on the lips of a buddha certainly become
magical, alive. Very ordinary words suddenly take a totally different
flavor, a new fragrance. They start being poetic. They have around them
a certain aura. That's why the words of a buddha start ringing bells in
your heart.</p><p>He is not speaking strange words. You know those words, you use those
words. But when a buddha speaks those same words, because they are
coming from no- mind, they carry some space around them that makes the
awakened one's words so authoritative. The awakened one is not
authoritative. He does not command you, he does not give quotations from
the scriptures to support as an evidence. He is his own authority.</p><p>I have been telling stories, and people who don't understand me have
sometimes written,</p><p>"Your stories go on changing. Sometimes you say something, sometimes
your story completely changes ..." They are only listening to the mere
words, not to me. They are blind people, they cannot see that my story
is a response to the people to whom I am talking. In the present moment
it takes a new shape, a new meaning, a new dimension.</p><p>My stories go on changing because life goes on changing. What can I
do about it?</p><p>Sometimes it is spring and there are flowers all over, and sometimes
it is not spring and the trees are standing naked without any leaves.
What can I do? Life goes on changing.</p><p>My stories are not dead, they are as alive as I am alive. They are
coming from a living source.</p><p>And they have told me -- great scholars and professors, linguists,
those belonging to different religions -- "I like your story but it is
not in the scriptures at all." I said, "Then you should put it in. Your
scripture is not growing, it is dead. If you like the story, if you felt
there was some meaning, then put it in your scripture."</p><p>Buddha is not the end of the world. There are going to be buddhas
after Gautam Buddha.</p><p>There will be buddhas after me, after you, and certainly they are
going to continuously improve. It is not an effort, it is a spontaneous
phenomenon.</p><p>When I start the story I don't know what shape it is going to take. I
am as much surprised as you are -- "My God! This story is not the story
I have heard before."</p><p>But what can I do? It is not my mind. Mind has a memory system, so it
goes on repeating the same gramophone record, and gets stuck at the same
point each time. If it is an ancient gramophone record, the needle goes
on stopping at the same place. You start again; again it will stop at
the same place.</p><p>Once I was participating as a student in an inter-university
competition for eloquence. I was the first one to speak, and the second
person came from the Sanskrit University of Varanasi. It is devoted
completely to Sanskrit scriptures and language. But the student must
have been feeling a little inferior to the other students who came from
different universities, because in the Sanskrit University they don't
teach English. So he must have crammed one statement in English of
Bertrand Russell, just to make an impression.</p><p>But he was nervous. As he started, after three or four lines, he
said, "Bertrand Russell has said ..." -- in English -- and then he
stopped. His mind went blank. I was just sitting by his side because he
was the second person to speak. The whole auditorium was full of
students and professors, and there was a great silence when he stopped.
I thought I should help him, so I told him, "Repeat again."</p><p>And when you have crammed something, you can repeat it only from the
very beginning.</p><p>So he said, "Sisters and brothers ..." So the whole audience started
laughing. He again repeated those three or four sentences and came to
the point, "Bertrand Russell has said</p><p>..." -- and a fullpoint.</p><p>I said, "Repeat!" Finding no way out, he again started, "Brothers and
sisters ..."</p><p>And it was such a joy -- for ten minutes it continued. I would say,
"Repeat," and finding no way out ... and I was the only help. Everybody
was laughing. And he would say,</p><p>"Sisters and brothers ..." -- and finished! Everybody was waiting for
these three sentences, "Bertrand Russell has said ..." -- fullpoint.</p><p>After ten minutes, the chairman, the vice-chancellor of the
university, himself was laughing, and he told the boy, "Just sit down.
Don't be worried, everything is</p><p>okay. Just sit down" -- he was perspiring. And the chancellor said to
me, "You should not have done this."</p><p>I said, "I was simply helping him. I never thought that he was a
gramophone record. I thought some time he may slip ahead -- `Bertrand
Russell has said ...' But he proved to be a gramophone record, broken.
It was not my fault. And anyway, he gave such a joyous evening. Even if
you give him the first prize, I am ready, because he has given so much
joy, nobody can give."</p><p>Now scientists have found that your memory system functions exactly
like the gramophone record. They have opened the brain for other
reasons, but somehow they found that if they put an electrode on the
memory point in your brain, you start saying something. And if they take
the electrode away, you stop and your brain automatically reverses.
Again when they put the electrode back, you start from "Brothers and
sisters" --</p><p>again the same. Take the electrode off, and you stop.</p><p>They have discovered that the mind has an automatic reverse system --
once you have stopped, it goes back to its original place. You touch
that spot again and the person starts saying the same thing. There is no
reason why he is speaking -- nobody has asked anything. But he is
helpless -- the memory starts repeating like a record.</p><p>Daiten must have been a scholar. He has quoted this sentence, not
from his own experience but from scriptures.</p><p>What is he saying? When Sekito asked him, "WHAT IS YOUR NO-MIND?"
DAITEN REPLIED, "THE ONE WHO SPEAKS IS IT." One who speaks</p><p>originally. If one speaks only that which is borrowed, it is from the
mind. But if</p><p>one speaks originally, spontaneously, then it is coming from the
space called no- mind. But he forgot the word òriginally'. That happens
to scholars; it cannot happen to a buddha. Whatever is coming, is coming
from the very source. But when you are repeating a scripture which is
not your experience, there is going to be some difficulty.</p><p>If he had said, "The one who speaks spontaneously -- that is the
place of no- mind ..." He has forgotten that one word òriginal', and
perhaps it was not written in the scripture itself, because no buddha
has written a single word. All</p><p>scriptures have been compiled by their disciples, sometimes after the
death. Sometimes hundreds of years have passed and then disciples of
disciples ... generations have passed.</p><p>The four gospels of Jesus are recorded after his death, and not
immediately, three hundred years afterwards. Now nobody was a witness;
all the witnesses were dead. And these gospels were recorded by people
who had not seen Jesus. They had not even seen Jerusalem. Now biblical
research scholars have found that even the geography that they have
mentioned in the four gospels is wrong. These people have never been to
Israel.</p><p>They have heard from others, who have heard from others, who have
heard from others.</p><p>That's why I have spoken on Thomas's gospel which was written in
India. He was a direct disciple of Jesus, but his gospel is not included
in the Holy Bible. It was discovered just thirty years ago, but it is
the most beautiful because at least Thomas was a witness. And it has
tremendous beauty because it is not only that he was a witness to Jesus,
here in India he went through a transformation.</p><p>He meditated, he practiced yoga, he lived like a sannyasin and moved
from monastery to monastery. Buddha's air was still there. Buddha was
gone five hundred years before that, but his fragrance was still alive.
So in his gospel there is a certain authority which is lacking in the
four gospels of the Bible. First he was a witness, he had heard Jesus,
and secondly he himself had experienced the truth. The combination of
both, gives a greater authority to the fifth gospel of Thomas than The
Holy Bible.</p><p>Thomas is the only man in the whole world whose body has not
deteriorated. His body is still in a church in Goa. Every year at
Christmas time, his body is brought out of the church and his coffin is
opened for any observer, for any scientist, for any researcher.</p><p>Nobody has been able to figure out why it looks so fresh, as if he
had died just now.</p><p>There seems to have been no device used. It is not kept in a freezing
temperature, it is in a hot country, but even the skin does not look as
if it is dead. He looks so fresh. I have been to see the body.</p><p>Jesus' miracles may have been a myth, but this man really managed a
miracle. After two thousand years he is the only person around the world
whose body looks as if it has died just now -- or perhaps he is fast
asleep. No smell, and if it can remain for two thousand years; there is
no problem for it to remain forever. Care has to be taken that nobody
disturbs it.</p><p>There have been efforts to disturb it by Hindus, by Mohammedans, by
people who are not Christians, because it is a great argument in favor
of Christianity. But the man Thomas was not a Christian, he never knew
about Christianity. He came just after Jesus was crucified. He left
Jerusalem for the simple reason that Jesus must have told his close
friends -- and Thomas was one of those who was very close to him --
about India, and about the universities of Nalanda and Takshashila, and
about meditation.</p><p>So now that Jesus was crucified, he saw there was no point in being
there, and he left. He came by ship, so he landed in South India. But he
traveled all over India, and met all kinds of mystics who were deeply
rooted in meditation. His body is a proof that he must have followed a
certain method which was known to the Tibetan lamas, to the Ladakh
people.</p><p>They used to use a certain method of meditation when the meditator
was dying</p><p>... at the last moment, a certain process called Bardo. It was
nothing but a post- hypnotic suggestion. When a man is dying, he is in a
very vulnerable state. And if he has been a meditator, then he is
perfectly awake. Death is coming, but he is perfectly awake. He can be
hypnotized and told, "When you leave your body, the body will remain
intact as it is</p><p>..." You have to continue repeating so that it enters, not only into
his mind, it enters even into his bones, into his marrow, into his
blood.</p><p>Bardo is a very intensive hypnosis, and it is also possible to give
directions for the future to the soul that is leaving the body. Both can
be done. The body can be preserved by post-hypnotic suggestion. But you
cannot do it if the man has died. Then there is nobody to listen to the
post-hypnotic suggestion. The man has to be alive, just on the verge of
death.</p><p>You give him the post-hypnotic suggestion: "Your body will remain
intact, will remain intact ... you go on." And if he is a meditator,
even the bones, the blood, the body starts listening. The soul will
leave but the body will remain completely</p><p>as the soul has left it.</p><p>This was one way that Bardo was used for the body.</p><p>And there was a second way. You can give suggestions to the leaving
soul as to what kind of womb will be good -- "Choose rightly. Don't be
accidental." Millions of people are making love, and millions of people
are dying. So those souls are roaming around, finding a couple who is
making love. This is accidental. Because they die unconsciously, they
unconsciously grope in the darkness, and whoever comes close by, just by
chance they enter into that womb.</p><p>Bardo prevents the accidental. It gives the soul a right direction:
"You need a certain kind of womb, so don't be in a hurry. You have been
a meditator, and you have to find a mother, a father, who will allow you
to meditate -- not only allow you to meditate but who will help you to
meditate, who are themselves meditators. So don't be in a hurry!</p><p>Choose a couple."</p><p>Sometimes the man of meditation takes time to find the right womb;
ordinary persons immediately enter into the womb. Bardo gives two kinds
of possibilities: the body can be kept, and the soul can be given a
sense of direction where to go. But this is possible only if the man has
been deeply into meditation, has been practicing meditation for a long
time, and was capable of remaining conscious when death comes, because
death is the greatest operation.</p><p>Nature has managed it so that nobody should die consciously, just as
a surgeon will not be ready to operate on you if you are conscious.
First he will give you chloroform or something that makes you
unconscious. Then he can operate on you because you don't know what is
happening. You are so deeply asleep that things can be removed from your
body, bones can be cut, replaced, anything can be done.</p><p>Death is the greatest operation, because the whole seventy years'
attachment to the body has to be broken. Nature has managed -- this is
the wisdom of nature, the intelligence of nature -- that a person who is
not capable of detachment with the body, who does not know that "I am
not the body," should be made unconscious. Otherwise he will be passing
through tremendous anguish and anxiety.</p><p>So it is natural wisdom, but it is not applicable to the meditator.
The meditator can afford to die consciously without any pain, without
any anguish, without any anxiety.</p><p>DAITEN REPLIED, "THE ONE WHO SPEAKS IS IT." AT THIS, SEKITO SHOUTED,
"KWATZ!" -- AND LEFT.</p><p>This shout says to Daiten, "Shut up! It is not you, it is borrowed. I
can see the deadness of your statement." Shouting "Kwatz!" is saying
"Shut up!" And then he left immediately, because there was no point in
wasting time with this man, he was just a dead scholar.</p><p>TEN DAYS LATER, DAITEN AGAIN CAME TO SEKITO AND ASKED, "THE</p><p>LAST ANSWER I SAID TO YOU WAS NOT NO-MIND."</p><p>He realized. He was sincere, at least, honest.</p><p>First he had tried to deceive Sekito -- you cannot deceive a master,
that is impossible. He looks through and through you. He knows from
where the answer is coming: from the mind or from the no-mind. It is so
clear to a master from where the answer is coming.</p><p>Any answer from the mind -- "Kwatz! Shut up!"</p><p>He must have thought about it: "Why did the master behave in such a
hard way? And I was a stranger, a new person. Certainly there must be
some reason why he behaved without any compassion. I must be wrong." And
then in ten days' meditation he understood, "What I said was only a
repetition of scriptures." So he came back.</p><p>TEN DAYS LATER, DAITEN AGAIN CAME TO SEKITO AND ASKED, "THE</p><p>LAST ANSWER I SAID TO YOU WAS NOT NO-MIND. WHAT IS NO- MIND?</p><p>Please tell me. I don't know."</p><p>An authentic seeker begins with "I don't know, because all that I
know is not mine. It does matter. I may have much knowledge, but as far
as I am concerned, I don't know."</p><p>This acceptance is the beginning of the search. If you know already,
there is no need to search, there is no need to seek.</p><p>SEKITO SAID, "WITHOUT RAISING EYEBROWS OR MOVING EYEBALLS, BRING YOUR
NO-MIND HERE."</p><p>Strange, but masters are strange people. They have their own ways of
pushing you into the unknown territory of your own being.</p><p>SEKITO SAID, "WITHOUT RAISING EYEBROWS OR MOVING EYEBALLS, BRING YOUR
NO-MIND HERE."</p><p>DAITEN SAID, "THERE IS NO NO-MIND TO BE BROUGHT. In the first</p><p>place, I don't know what no-mind is. In the second place, if it is
no-mind how can you bring it? It is not a thing. It is not even a
thought, it is pure awareness. It cannot be brought here as an object
for your observation."</p><p>SEKITO SAID, "BASICALLY, NO-MIND IS." You cannot bring it -- I can
understand.</p><p>It is not a thing, it is not a thought, it is only pure isness,
thisness, suchness. "BASICALLY, NO-MIND IS. WHY DO YOU SAY NO-MIND IS
NOT?" It is</p><p>the only isness in existence. Because you cannot bring it, you think,
"It is not.</p><p>That's why I cannot bring it." You cannot bring it because no-mind is
the whole universe. How can you bring it? It is already here.</p><p>This very moment it is here, as it was in front of Sekito.</p><p>"WHY DO YOU SAY NO-MIND IS NOT? THAT IS THE WRONG STATEMENT."</p><p>Just say I don't know. Say no-mind is not a thing, not a thought,
hence it cannot be brought. But don't say no-mind is not. No-mind only
is -- pure is.</p><p>AT THIS, DAITEN WAS GREATLY ENLIGHTENED -- hearing this
statement,</p><p>that all that is, is no-mind. Isness and no-mind are two names of the
same thing. This presence of life in the trees, in the stones, in
people, in birds ... this vast isness, this presence is no-mind. You
don't have to bring it here, it is already here. You cannot take it
anywhere else.</p><p>As far as time is concerned, it is now. As far as space is concerned,
it is here.</p><p>If you are silent, you will immediately become aware of it.</p><p>This statement made such a deep penetration into Daiten, he was
greatly enlightened.</p><p>An authentic seeker, sincere seeker, who does not hide himself behind
false knowledge, borrowed knowledge, who does not pretend that he knows
without knowing, if he accepts</p><p>"I don't know" -- he is already very close to the truth. He has
accepted his innocence now there is no barrier. No God, no scripture, no
knowledge -- he is just as close as one can be to no-mind. A little push
by the master, a little statement, and he will be drowned into
existence. That drowning into existence is enlightenment. Disappearing
into existence is enlightenment.</p><p>I have always loved one story from China .…</p><p>The emperor of China was a great painter. At his seventy-fifth
birthday, he was feeling old, and perhaps the day was not far away when
he would have to leave the body. So he arranged a great competition
before he would leave the body: a competition for painting throughout
China.</p><p>First, in every state there would be a competition, and one painting
would be chosen.</p><p>Then the final would be in the capital, and the emperor would choose
which was the greatest painting. He himself was a competitor. He had
painted a beautiful painting.</p><p>All the painters came from all over China. They all brought their
great canvases that they had done. Only one man came without any
painting, just paint and a</p><p>brush -- strange fellow!</p><p>The emperor asked, "Where is the painting?"</p><p>He said, "I don't like old things. I will paint freshly here and now.
You have to give me a room, because I don't paint on canvas, I paint on
the walls. Give me the biggest room in your palace and don't disturb me.
And keep a guard so that nobody disturbs me. I don't know how long it
will take, because it is going to be a spontaneous thing. I don't know
what I am going to paint. I am just going to paint out of spontaneity,
whatever happens, however long it takes."</p><p>The king said, "I am getting old, that's why I have arranged this
competition. You have to be quick and fast."</p><p>He said, "No. I don't know. It may be quick. Tomorrow morning I may
inform you that the painting is complete, or it may take longer. I
cannot promise."</p><p>No man of understanding can ever promise anybody, because who knows
about the next moment? All promising is in ignorance.</p><p>The king said, "You are a difficult person, but I can see in your
eyes, and I can see in your face -- perhaps you will be the greatest
painter." So he gave him the biggest room in the palace -- and there
were many big rooms -- with a plain wall so he could paint, and he
closed the doors.</p><p>The painter said, "Nobody should enter, not even you, until the
painting is complete. I will come out for food or anything I need." And
he kept a curtain also so that even the guards could not have a look
inside at what was happening behind the curtain.</p><p>It took three years for him, and the king was saying, "What are you
doing? I may never be able to see your painting, I may die!"</p><p>The painter said, "It does not matter. If you die you die. If you are
alive you will be able to see it. But I cannot do anything in a
hurry."</p><p>The emperor had to wait.</p><p>Four years passed and the painter came out one morning and said to
the emperor, "The painting is complete. You are welcome."</p><p>Such curiosity had arisen in the emperor's mind. For four years, he
was thinking, "What is that guy painting?" He himself was a painter. It
did not take four years for one painting.</p><p>And when he came the emperor immediately followed him. They went
behind the curtain.</p><p>The painting was just unbelievable; it looked so real. He had painted
a huge forest, so green, lush green, almost three-dimensional. And a
small path was going -- you could see the path was going and going ...
and then it disappeared into the thickness of the jungle.</p><p>And the emperor said, "Where does this path go?"</p><p>The painter said, "Let us ... Come with me. We can walk and see where
the path goes, because without experience you will not know where it
goes."</p><p>The story is, both went into the path -- the guards were watching --
and as the path turned around, they both turned around and since then
nothing has been heard.</p><p>This story -- in a painting you cannot enter -- is a symbolic story.
It says you can enter in the isness of things. The painter has made the
painting so alive that branches were moving in the wind. The path was no
ordinary path, and the symbolic meaning is: if you cannot enter into a
painting, the painting is not worth calling a painting. But entering
does not mean physical entry. Entering means you get lost completely:
you are no more, only the painting is.</p><p>That's how you enter into meditation -- you are no more. You come
across a tremendous isness; everything disappears, you disappear, yet
that isness remains. That experience of isness is enlightenment. This
story simply gives a symbolic representation of enlightenment.</p><p>A painter is not worth the salt if he himself cannot disappear into
his own painting.</p><p>Picasso is reported to have said, "When I am painting, I am no more,
only the painting is."</p><p>Nijinsky has said many times in his life -- because he was asked
again and again</p><p>--</p><p>"When I am dancing I am no more. As long as I am, the dance is
superficial. When only dancing remains and I am no more, then it has a
tremendous quality." It was observed by scientists, and they could see
the tremendous quality. Whenever he forgot himself completely in dancing
he used to jump higher than gravitation allows. Scientists were simply
at a loss how to figure it out, because that much of a jump was not
possible.</p><p>And even more miraculous was his coming back Gravitation pulls
everything</p><p>so fast.</p><p>You see every night -- you think stars are falling. All around the
earth six thousand stars fall every day on the earth. They are not
stars, stars are very big, a thousand times, a million times bigger than
the earth. If one star falls, we are finished. Those are not stars,
those are small stones which have been left hanging in space.</p><p>When the moon separated from the earth -- once it was part of the
earth You</p><p>have all these great oceans, the great Indian Ocean, and the Pacific,
and the Atlantic. All these oceans are created because the mud and the
stones and everything from these places fell out, because the earth was
liquid -- in the beginning it was liquid. The moon is just the
combination of that whole lot that has fallen out of the earth. But it
created great oceans -</p><p>- the Pacific is five miles deep.</p><p>But when such great lumps fell out, many small pieces also fell out.
Those small pieces are just floating in space, millions of pieces of
stone of different sizes. The earth's gravitation pulls these stones
downwards, and at the point where the atmosphere begins, it is two
hundred miles deep. Around the earth there is a thickness of two hundred
miles of atmosphere, because up to that point there is air. Beyond that
there is no air; it is pure space, even air is not existent. Sometimes
those small stones -- and there are a few big stones also ...</p><p>The stone in the Mohammedans' holy place that they worship, Kaaba, is
also one of the stones that has fallen from outer space, but it is a
very huge stone. In every museum you can find stones which have reached
to the earth.</p><p>But what happens when they enter the earth's atmosphere by chance?
Gravitation</p><p>pulls them so fast that the friction with the air makes them turn
into a fiery stone, a fire. That is why you can see them up to a point,
and then suddenly they disappear. If the stone was small, then it would
come to a certain point and it would be burned out. The force of
gravitation is such that only very big stones can come up to the earth,
otherwise they disappear in the air somewhere.</p><p>Nijinsky's coming back was absolutely against gravitation. He came
just as a feather comes slowly -- so slow was his movement coming back.
Both the things were against gravitation: first his jump, and then his
coming like a feather as if he had no weight; gravitation cannot work on
it.</p><p>And he was asked about it again and again. He said, "I have tried,
but whenever I try, it does not happen so I cannot say anything about
it. When I am not, when I get completely disappointed and forget all
about it, that one day suddenly it happens. When I am not trying to do
it, it happens. I am not, only the dance is. When I am not, only the
dance is."</p><p>Nijinsky perhaps was the greatest dancer in the world.</p><p>But this is the misfortune -- that these people were born in the
West. They had no idea that they were so close to no-mind. They needed a
master just to give them a little push.</p><p>Nijinsky would have been a Gautam Buddha, and Picasso would have been
a Gautam Buddha. They have come so close. But the West has no idea how
to go ahead, how to go into the painting.</p><p>Just move on on the road and get lost. That will be your great
experience -- when you are lost. When you are no more, only existence
is.</p><p>And this existence gives you such bliss, such ecstasy, such eternity,
that you are bound to feel a tremendous sacredness, a great reverence
for life and this vast universe which has given birth to you.</p><p>One day it will allow you to disappear again into the oceanic
consciousness. This entering into the oceanic consciousness is
enlightenment.</p><p>Shiki wrote:</p><p>THE MOON RISES --</p><p>LEAF UPON LEAF UPON LEAF FLUTTERS DOWN.</p><p>He must be sitting under a tree, and it must be the time for fall.
"The moon rises ..." -- he is watching the moon rising.</p><p>Zen has many ways of meditation -- watch the moon rising. The
emphasis is on watching, not on the moon. Watch the sun rising. The
emphasis is on watching, what I am calling witnessing to make it more
clear -- witness the sun is rising. And witness "leaf upon leaf upon
leaf flutters down" -- and you are just a witness.</p><p>On one side the sun is rising, on the other side, "leaf upon leaf
upon leaf flutters down."</p><p>And between these two you are just a mirror, no judgment.</p><p>He is not saying that the sunrise is beautiful, and he is not saying
that the leaf upon leaf upon leaf are creating beautiful music in the
air. No, he is not making any judgment. He is simply describing what he
has been witnessing, just like a mirror, showing you the sun is rising,
and leaf upon leaf upon leaf is fluttering down. He is just a
watcher.</p><p>This is the whole secret of Zen. Question 4</p><p>Maneesha's question:</p><p>OUR BELOVED MASTER,</p><p>ST. BERNARD WROTE: "WHO IS GOD? I CAN THINK OF NO BETTER ANSWER</p><p>THAN: HE WHO IS."</p><p>ECKHART STATED: "THOU MUST LOVE GOD AS NOT-GOD, NOT- SPIRIT,
NOT-PERSON, NOT-IMAGE, BUT AS HE IS -- A SHEER, PURE,</p><p>ABSOLUTE ONE, SUNDERED FROM ALL TWONESS AND IN WHOM WE MUST
ETERNALLY</p><p>SINK FROM NOTHINGNESS TO NOTHINGNESS."</p><p>IF ONE SUBSTITUTED THE PRONOUN `HE' WITH ÌT', WOULD NOT THESE</p><p>TWO CHRISTIAN MYSTICS BE SPEAKING THE LANGUAGE OF ZEN?</p><p>Maneesha, you can change thèhe' into ìt', and certainly they will be
speaking the language of Zen, but you cannot do that. It is their
statement, not yours. They are still saying `he'. They are not even
saying `she'; ìt' is far away -- although they have come very close to
the point. That's why both the saints were in trouble with the orthodox
church, particularly Eckhart who was tortured, harassed, threatened to
be expelled if he published his books. His books were published after
his death because of these statements.</p><p>The statement is tremendously good, but still, somehow the faint
image of God is present.</p><p>"Who is God? I can think of no better answer than: He who is." Using
the word</p><p>`he' and saying "who is," is very close; only thèhe' is standing in
between.</p><p>That's what I have been telling you -- even a very thin concept of
God as a person is going to create enough of a barrier for you.</p><p>St. Bernard has come very close, but to be close is still to be at a
distance. Closeness is a kind of distance. What does it mean? You may be
one inch away, or one mile away, or one thousand miles away -- you are
away. Even one inch away -- you are away. That one inch is as thick as
the China Wall, solid rock.</p><p>When St. Bernard says, "He who is," using the word `he', he accepts a
personality, and not only a personality but a male personality. Both are
wrong. Existence is neither male nor female. It expresses in the both --
as female, as male, but it itself is simply pure isness. Its expression
will be manifold, but its essence is the same. A woman in her
interiority is as pure a consciousness as a man in his interiority.</p><p>If St. Bernard had really experienced isness, he would not have used
the word</p><p>`God' or</p><p>`he'. He seems he must have been a great giant, but only
intellectual. Many times philosophers have come very close, but then
they go on in a round and go far away. Just coming close is not enough,
but even this was condemned by the church, by the pope.</p><p>Certainly St. Bernard has some conception of a male God, and you
cannot change his statement. If you change his statement, then it comes
exactly to what Zen is. But then it will not be the statement of
St. Bernard, it will be your statement.</p><p>So I would say that he came very close, but because of thèGod', and
because the programming in his mind of the Christian God was still
there, that prevented him from the quantum leap from mind to no-mind.
His idea is still within the mind. He has logically and rationally
worked out that if God is there he can only be described as "He who is."
But this is not the exact experience.</p><p>The exact experience will not use the word `God', will not use the
word `he'. It is male-chauvinistic, and it gives a personality to
existence which it has not. It is infinite, so it cannot have a
personality. It cannot be called who, and it cannot be called he.</p><p>So St. Bernard is still not enlightened -- intellectually great,
logically great, but existentially still a little far away from the
truth.</p><p>Eckhart comes even more close, maybe just a fragment of an inch away,
when he says,</p><p>"Thou must love God as not-God, not-spirit, not-person, not-image,
but as he is -</p><p>- a sheer, pure, absolute One, sundered from all twoness and in whom
we must eternally sink from nothingness to nothingness." He has come
very much closer than St. Bernard, and hence he was more condemned than
St. Bernard, because he was destroying the whole Christian theology.</p><p>But still I say he is within the framework of the Christian God,
although he seems to be a far more refined intellect than St. Bernard --
a very thin barrier, a Japanese rice-paper barrier. But that is enough
to keep your eyes closed.</p><p>His statement is beautiful: "Thou must love God as not-God." But why
use the</p><p>word</p><p>`God' at all if it is to be loved as not-God? Why not say, "Thou must
love not- God, not-Spirit, not-person, not-image, but just the sheer
existence, pure, absolute One, sundered from all twoness, and in it we
must eternally sink from nothingness to nothingness"? But his beginning,
"Thou must love God," is a Christian programming.</p><p>Zen has dropped all programming. It has dared as much as human
consciousness is capable of. Now making this statement has a certain
compromise with the church. "Thou must love God" -- so the Christian
church is satisfied that he is still talking about God, although a
little crazy, because he says, you must love God as not-God. Then who is
he?</p><p>a woman? a man? a tree? the ocean ...? What do you mean by
"not-God"?</p><p>So Christianity condemned him, but because he was saying, "Thou must
love God," they told him not to publish such writings while he was
alive, because they would create doubt in people's minds. And they have
been doing that even today.</p><p>They prevented one great French scientist, Chardin, from publishing
his papers about the Peking man -- he discovered the Peking man --
"because your papers will go against Christianity." And because he was
an ordained priest, he had to follow the orders from the Vatican. They
destroyed a great man. He could have contributed much. But if you don't
have any feedback, if other scientists don't know what you are writing,
what you are discovering, and you don't know their opinions ... It needs
constant feedback.</p><p>Science grows, not by one scientist, it grows amongst all the
scientists. There is a constant dialogue going on through papers,
through conferences, through books, through periodicals ... a constant
dialogue is happening all around the world. That's how science tries to
figure out the best hypothesis about anything.</p><p>Now preventing Chardin from publishing any paper, from attending any
conference, from writing any book while he was alive -- and of course
when you are dead somebody else will write it, you will not ... Somebody
else does not have the same scientific background, nor the same
discovery. And after your death what happens to your ideas will not be a
feedback; you will not be able to improve upon it. They destroyed a
great scientist of the same caliber as Albert</p><p>Einstein.</p><p>But I am also angry at Chardin. Rather than stopping his writings and
researches, why did he not resign from being a Christian priest? He
resigned from science in favor of Christian superstition. Nobody has
raised the question that he is also part of the whole slavery game;
everybody has condemned the Vatican.</p><p>I condemn the Vatican, but I also condemn Chardin -- Chardin more
than the Vatican.</p><p>The Vatican has been doing that for centuries -- that is not new. But
why was Chardin such a sheep? Why could he not gather the courage? A man
of such tremendous intelligence should have left the priesthood. What
was in it? A religion that prevents you from declaring truth is not
worth being part of.</p><p>But he proved a coward -- he stopped writing. And now a Chardin
society exists in France which publishes his works and papers and his
researches -- but it is too late. If somebody raises a question, Chardin
is not there to answer. And by the time Chardin died, other scientists
had come to better hypotheses. If he had been allowed, or if he had had
the guts to come out of the church, he would have managed to refine. It
is a continuous growth and evolution. Science is not something
static.</p><p>When Albert Einstein was asked, "If you had not discovered the theory
of relativity, do you think it would ever have been discovered?" Albert
Einstein said, "It would not have taken more than three weeks." And
finally it was found that somebody in Germany had already discovered it
before Albert Einstein, but he was a lazy guy and did not publish the
paper. So not after three weeks, but three weeks before, it had been
found.</p><p>Einstein was right -- that when something is there, sooner or later
it has to be discovered.</p><p>You cannot go on missing it if there is a truth in it.</p><p>Eckhart also proved to be a little cowardly, just like Chardin. He
came very close, but he continuously maintained that he loved God. Of
course he has those conditions "as not-God ..." Then as what? And if you
are loving only the isness of existence, then why go on calling it God?
Why continue that old superstition, that old lie? Just a compromise with
the Vatican, just a fear that if you don't do</p><p>that much you are taking a risk with your life.</p><p>I was born into Jainism, and when I started speaking against their
ideologies -- and when I say anything I say it with my total being --
they were unable to answer me. Their highest command decided to expel me
from Jainism. But I wrote to them: "You need not expel me, I expel your
whole Jainism and your whole Jaina society. You need not expel me, I
have already expelled you." So they were shocked, they could not figure
out what to do. They could not expel me, I was already outside -- what
does it matter? And I don't think it has done any harm to me.</p><p>Compromise is always cowardly. Truth never compromises.</p><p>Maneesha, both these people were very close to Zen, but both were
cowards. God makes people cowards. Religion makes people cowards.
Otherwise, what was the risk? Eckhart should have left Christianity, St.
Bernard should have left Christianity, and then they would have been the
very first Zen masters in the West. But they missed that great
opportunity, that great dignity. They remained slaves of the Christian
church.</p><p>I want you to be lions and not like sheep as Jesus wanted you to be.

closer, but stops in her tracks when she sees the huge growing lump in
Christ's knickers.</p><p>"Mary! Mary!" moans Jesus. "Closer, come closer!"</p><p>Mary shuffles forward nervously eyeing the ever-growing mountain in
his underpants --</p><p>then she stops, again.</p><p>"Mary! Mary!" gasps Jesus. "I have something from the Holy Ghost to

people have ever reached to their center who had this urgency, this
intensity.</p><p>Faster and faster ... Deeper and deeper ...</p><p>As you come closer to your inner center, a great silence descends
over you just like soft rain with all its coolness. And inside you, a
great peace arises, a peace that passeth understanding.</p><p>A little more close -- and you feel so blessed.</p><p>A little more close, and you are getting drunk with the divine. Just

waiting and waiting, hidden deep inside you. A sincere request, a
welcoming heart, and he is bound to come behind you.</p><p>This is the first step of enlightenment: Gautam Buddha behind you as

shadow is pure light, pure presence.</p><p>You can feel the warmth of it, you can almost feel the touch of it.
It surrounds you with a new fragrance, and it gives you a totally new
dimension to live.</p><p>Your everyday acts start changing their color, their approach. Your
very life</p><p>becomes meditative.</p><p>At the second stage, the buddha comes in front of you, and you become
the shadow. To be a shadow of the buddha is a beautiful experience. And
the experience goes on becoming deeper and deeper as the shadow
disappears.</p><p>At the third and final stage, there is no more of you -- not even a
shadow, only the buddha is.</p><p>This isness is the master key to open all the doors of the mysterious
existence that surrounds you. Once you have the key, you are the master
of your own being. There is nobody above you, there is nobody below you.
For the first time you experience a tremendous communion with the whole
existence.</p><p>I call this the only authentic spirituality, the only authentic
religiousness. Now don't forget to request the buddha to come behind you
...</p><p>Nivedano ... (Drumbeat)</p><p>Come back ... but come as a buddha, with great grace, peace,
silence.</p><p>Sit down for a few moments just to remember the golden path that you
have traveled, the center that you have found within you, the opening
into the cosmos, and all those fragrances from the beyond; the silence
showering on you, and the warmth of the buddha who has come behind
you.</p><p>You can feel him. It is your very nature. It is you in your
truthfulness, in your existential experience.</p><p>If the first step is complete, the second will follow automatically.
When the second is complete, the third will follow automatically.</p><p>The day you will complete the third step will be the most fortunate
day in your life. That day you will be awakened from a long, long sleep,
a spiritual sleep. That day you will become enlightened.</p><p>Then there is no more birth, no more death. You have become one with
the</p><p>whole.</p><p>This is the only holiness I know of. There is no other. Okay,
Maneesha?</p><p>Yes, Beloved Master.</p><p>I Celebrate Myself: God Is No Where, Life Is Now Here Chapter #3</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=_index>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

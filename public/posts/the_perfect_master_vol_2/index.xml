Exactly in the Middle
10 July 1978 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
YOU MAKE IT ALL SOUND SO EASY. BUT IS IT? IS IT REALLY? IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE WHOLE THING IS OUT OF OUR HANDS. WE HAVE NO MORE CHOICE TO SURRENDER THAN TO BE IN THE EGO. I LIVE MY LIFE AND SOME DAYS I’M HAPPY AND SOME DAYS I’M SAD, BUT I’M NOT ENLIGHTENED.</description>

There is no Self, no Other
2 July 1978 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A MASTER AND A PSYCHOTHERAPIST?
A MASTER IS NOT: A PSYCHOTHERAPIST IS. The Master is a hollow bamboo, a mere passage, for the divine to descend. He is not on his own. He has nothing to say, he has nothing to do – but much happens through him.</description>

‌CHAPTER 10
Man amp; God–The Spiritual Dimension of Life
We begin the journey in search of the Supreme Truth. ‘Meditation’ is going to be our ‘via media’. I shall only light the path for you. Then onwards you shall make the journey on your own spiritual strength. Therefore, do not merely lend me your ears but listen to me with attention and then translate the thoughts into action.</description>

CONVERSATIONS
DR. GUINEBERT: ACHARYAJI, WILL YOU PLEASE EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY YOGA, YOGI AND MEDITATION?
Osho: The first thing about meditation is that it is not something which can be done. In the whole world we have a notion that meditation means ‘doing something’. It is not a doing. It is not an act. It is some thing which happens.</description>

‌No Mission, No Message
1 October 1969 pm in Pahalgam, Kashmir, India
FIRST QUESTIONER: WHAT IS YOUR MISSION IN LIFE? AND WHAT METHOD SHOULD WE USE TO FULFILL THIS MISSION?
OSHO: As far as my mission in life is concerned, there is no such thing as my mission. Neither is there any my, nor is there any mission. I am not teaching something to others – there is no message to be given to the world.</description>

‌DHRITARASHTRA SAID:
O SANJAY, ASSEMBLED ON THE FIELD OF RIGHTEOUSNESS, THE FIELD OF THE KURUS, AND EAGER TO FIGHT, WHAT DID MY SONS AND THE SONS OF PANDU DO?
Dhritarashtra is blind. However, longing or passionate desire never disappears because of the lack of sight. If Surdas had thought of Dhritarashtra, he would not have pierced his eyes.
Surdas pierced his eyes in the belief that the desire and longing would never crop up once sight was destroyed.</description>

‌CHAPTER 8
Bhuribai
11 September 1980 pm in Osho Commune International, India
Translated from: JYUN THA TYUN THARAYA. Published in OTI 16 August 1991.
Bhuribai is very closely connected with me. I have come to know thousands of men, thousands of women, but Bhuribai was unique among them.
Bhuribai’s mahaparinirvana – her death attaining the highest liberation – happened just recently. Count her with Meera, Rabiya, Sahajo, Daya – she is qualified to be among these few selected women.</description>

‌CHAPTER 9
Women Mystics
All are translated from Hindi talks
I have spoken on enlightened men. For the first time I start discussions on enlightened women. It was easy to speak on enlightened men. I can understand them – they are alike. It will be a little bit difficult to speak on enlightened women – it is a little stranger path. Although man and woman are one in their innermost core, their expressions are very different.</description>

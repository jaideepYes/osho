IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE LAST WORD, I’LL TELL YOU SIMPLY – THIS! THIS!”\nManeesha, I am immensely grateful that you have reminded me of Seppo. I have always wanted to bring Seppo to you because he is one of the most precious buddhas who has walked on the earth.\nHe was unique in his own way; in his teaching, words were not important but only thisness, the utter silence of existence. The chattering of the birds are the only holy scriptures in the world. And the commentaries of the bamboos are really honest, sincere and to the point.\nSeppo would have loved this assembly, this moment of silent waiting. He was not as fortunate as I am. He had very few disciples but that is very unjust of existence. Seppo should have had the whole world as his disciples because what he is giving is the ultimate essence.\n(THE CHIRPING OF BIRDS RUNS THROUGH THE SILENCE OF BUDDHA HALL.)\nThis was Seppo.\nThey have all gathered here.\nThis story makes Seppo’s method of teaching clear:\nWHEN SEPPO WAS LIVING IN HIS HERMITAGE, TWO MONKS CAME TO PAY THEIR RESPECTS. AS SEPPO SAW THEM COMING HE PUSHED OPEN THE GATE AND, PRESENTING HIMSELF BEFORE THEM, SAID, “WHAT IS THIS?”\nThe monks must have been at a loss. In fact, Seppo’s opening the gate, standing before them, was a question to be asked by them. But before they had said anything Seppo himself without being questioned, asked, “What is this?”\nIn utter confusion those two monks said to Seppo, “What is this? We have not even asked, we have not even entered the gate, we have not even said hello to you and you open the gate, and standing before us irrationally ask, ‘What is this?’ In fact, we ask you about your behavior, ‘WHAT IS THIS?’”\nThey missed the point. SEPPO LOWERED HIS HEAD AND RETURNED TO HIS COTTAGE. This lowering of the head of the master is a deep sadness about the misunderstanding these two monks have shown. And he returned to his cottage because there is no point in saying anything more. He has already said more than is absolutely essential. This becomes clear – that he has already said more.\nLATER THE MONKS CAME TO GANTO WHO SAID, “WHERE ARE YOU FROM?”\nGanto was Seppo’s master.\nTHE MONKS ANSWERED, “WE HAVE COME FROM SOUTH OF THE NANREI MOUNTAINS.” GANTO SAID, “HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO SEE SEPPO?”\nTHE MONKS SAID, “YES, WE HAVE BEEN TO HIM.” GANTO SAID, “WHAT DID HE SAY TO YOU?”\nTHE MONKS RELATED THE WHOLE STORY.\nGANTO SAID, “ALAS! I REGRET THAT I DID NOT TELL HIM THE LAST WORD WHEN I WAS WITH HIM. IF I HAD DONE SO, NO ONE IN THE WHOLE WORLD COULD HAVE PRETENDED TO OUTDO HIM.”\nAT THE END OF THE SUMMER SESSION, THE MONKS REPEATED THE STORY AND ASKED GANTO FOR HIS INSTRUCTION.\nGANTO SAID, “WHY DIDN’T YOU ASK EARLIER?”\nTHE MONKS SAID, “WE HAVE HAD A HARD TIME STRUGGLING WITH THIS TOPIC.”\nGANTO SAID, “SEPPO CAME TO LIFE IN THE SAME WAY THAT I DID, BUT HE DOES NOT DIE IN THE SAME WAY THAT I DO. IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE LAST WORD, I WILL TELL YOU SIMPLY – THIS! THIS!”\nGanto is saying that to ask, “What is this?” is not exactly right. The existence cannot be questioned, it cannot be a ‘what’. It simply is, without any question and without any answer.\nSimply ‘this’.\nThis small anecdote converging in the smallest possible word, ‘this’, gives you the very essence of religiousness – the mystery of it, the beauty of it, the truth of it. You cannot answer and you cannot ask, you have simply to live; to live thisness – in Gautam Buddha’s words suchness, tathata – is the whole of religious consciousness.\nJust live this moment in its totality, without wavering; neither thinking of the past which is no more, nor projecting about the future which is not yet.\nAll that you have is the purity of thisness, this moment.\nAnd the glory and the ecstasy cannot be higher, cannot be deeper if you can understand the simple experience of thisness.\nSetcho’s commentary on it: THE LAST WORD, LET ME TELL YOU – LIGHT AND DARKNESS INTERMINGLED,\nLIVING IN THE SAME WAY, YOU ALL KNOW; DYING IN DIFFERENT WAYS – BEYOND TELLING! ABSOLUTELY BEYOND TELLING!\nBUDDHA AND DHARMA ONLY NOD... Buddha and Bodhidharma – Dharma is a short form of Bodhidharma. BUDDHA AND BODHIDHARMA ONLY NOD TO THEMSELVES.\nThey utter not even the simplest word, this.\nThey simply nod. In their nodding is said everything sayable, unsayable. In their nodding is the whole mystery of existence.\nEAST, WEST, NORTH AND SOUTH – HOMEWARD LET US GO. LATE AT NIGHT, SEEING THE SNOW ON THE THOUSAND PEAKS.\nAs I have told you before, Setcho is a great intellectual but he is not an enlightened man. Once in a while, he makes a comment that is beautiful, but it is coming out of his head rather than out of his being. He is not accounted in the long line of buddhas. He remains only a commentator. And a commentator, however great, is simply repeating, paraphrasing the experience that is not his own.\nI don’t want you to be commentators.\nI want you to be in the very center of existence, of your being.\nThat is the only way to understand this tremendous mystery that surrounds you. Another story...\nSEPPO IS ALSO KNOWN AS HSUEH-FENG. SEPPO ONCE SPOKE OF AN INCIDENT THAT CONTRIBUTED TO HIS AWAKENING:\n“WHEN I ASKED MASTER TOKUSAN WHETHER I COULD SHARE THE EXPERIENCE THAT THE ANCIENT MASTERS KNEW, HE STRUCK ME, AND I WAS LIKE A BUCKET WHOSE BOTTOM HAD JUST DROPPED OUT.\nGANTO UTTERED A WARNING ‘HO!’ AND ASKED, “DON’T YOU KNOW WHAT COMES FROM WITHOUT IS NOT AS GOOD AS WHAT IS PRODUCED WITHIN? IF YOU WERE REVEALING YOUR EXPERIENCE OF CH’AN, OR ZEN OR DHYAN, EVERYTHING THAT YOU SAID OR DID WOULD FLOW DIRECTLY FROM THE CENTER OF YOUR INNERMOST BEING, WHICH IN TURN WOULD EMBRACE AND PENETRATE THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE.”\nUPON HEARING THIS SEPPO SUDDENLY WAS ENLIGHTENED AND MADE A DEEP BOW TO GANTO.\nThese beautiful stories and these beautiful people have almost disappeared from the world. They were not plastic and they were not phony. They were utterly innocent, authentic. I want my people to bring back those golden moments which have disappeared from the world.\nThere is a story about one of Seppo’s disciples named Tozan:\nWHEN HE FIRST WENT TO SEPPO HE HAD HARDLY ENTERED THE GATE WHEN SEPPO PUSHED HIM OVER AND SAID, “WHAT IS THIS?”\nAND TOZAN WAS IMMEDIATELY ENLIGHTENED. FORGETTING HIMSELF HE JUST LIFTED UP HIS HANDS AND DANCED AROUND. SEPPO SAID, “ARE YOU BEHAVING RATIONALLY?”\nTOZAN SAID, “WHAT HAS THIS TO DO WITH RATIONALITY?”\nSEPPO STROKED HIS BACK AND CONFIRMED HIS ENLIGHTENMENT.\nA dance can say much more than any philosophy. A simple shout ‘Ho’, can bring you to this moment. Anything that can bring you to your home is the only religion I know of. The so-called religions of the world are simply deceiving and exploiting people. People have to be awakened.\nZen has become my most beloved for the simple reason that it does not create any theology. It does not bother about God. Because God is always that, God is always there. And the real concern is this, not that. here, not there. now, not then.\nSEPPO WAS CUTTING TREES ONE DAY WITH CHOSEI AND SAID TO HIM, “WHEN YOU CUT, CUT TO THE HEART. THEN STOP.”\nCHOSEI SAID, “I HAVE CUT AND FINISHED.”\nSEPPO SAID, “FORMER MASTERS TRANSMITTED THE TRUTH FROM MIND TO MIND. WOULD YOU REALLY SAY THAT YOU HAVE CUT AND FINISHED?”\nCHOSEI SAID, “THROWING THE AXE TO THE GROUND, IT IS TRANSMITTED.” SEPPO STRUCK HIM WITH HIS STICK.\nIt is out of tremendous love and great compassion that a Zen master ever strikes anybody. This is a different language than saying that you have got it, that you are enlightened.\nA master’s stick is awaited by the disciple for years, because he will hit you only if he knows that his hit is going to awaken you; or he will hit only when you are awakened as a reward. In the modern world it will not be at all understood. When, for the first time, Zen stories were translated, everybody thought that they were some kind of jokes.\nThey are not jokes. But because they were first translated by Christian missionaries, it was just to show to the world: “Look at the greatness of Christianity and look at these primitive people thinking that they are enlightened.” But the whole thing misfired. These stories were translated by Christian missionaries to prove Christianity’s superiority.\nBut in fact, these stories – if understood, experienced – simply prove that there cannot be anything superior to them. Their utter innocence... just look at the disciple dancing. Because he has got it! Just look at the master hitting the disciple as a reward.\nThis is possible only at the very heights of consciousness.\nMan has progressed technologically, scientifically, but man has forgotten the language of his own being. There is progress in gadgets, but man is completely lost.\nI want you to remember that your first task in life is to be fully, wholly aware of yourself. Because without being totally aware, you will never know the beauty and the splendor of this existence that surrounds you. You will never know your birth, your death. You will never really know that you ever lived.\nWithout being aware you are all somnambulists, walking in sleep, talking in sleep. And you have become so accustomed to your sleep that you can even do complicated things while you are completely asleep. You can be efficient in doing certain jobs while snoring within your being.\nThe whole world thinks that in the morning they wake up, and by the evening they go to sleep again. It is sheer nonsense. Once you wake up, you never go to sleep. So the waking in the morning is just fake, very superficial. You have to learn the authentic awakening.\nSEPPO WAS SAYING GOOD-BYE TO TOZAN WHO ASKED HIM, “WHERE ARE YOU OFF TO?” SEPPO ANSWERED, “I AM GOING BACK TO REICHU.”\n“AT THAT TIME, WHAT ROAD DID YOU COME BY?” ASKED TOZAN. “BY HIENREI,” ANSWERED SEPPO.\n“AND BY WHAT ROAD ARE YOU GOING BACK?” ASKED TOZAN. “THE SAME ROAD,” SEPPO ANSWERED.\n“DO YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW THE ONE WHO NEVER LEAVES IS HIENREI, THE ROAD?”\nPeople come and go, the road remains.\nTozan is reminding Seppo, “Don’t be a coming and going, but be a remaining. There is nowhere to go, you are already there. Just realize it.”\nSEPPO SAID, “I DON’T KNOW THAT ONE THAT REMAINS.” “WHY NOT?” ASKED TOZAN.\n“BECAUSE THE ONE HAS NO PERSONALITY,” ANSWERED SEPPO.\nTOZAN SAID, “YOU SAY THAT YOU DON’T KNOW THAT ONE. IF SO, HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT THE ONE HAS NO PERSONALITY?”\nThese dialogues are so totally different from the dialogues of Socrates and Plato. Beautiful dialogues, very rational, but these dialogues are simply of another world, of another consciousness.\nTozan is a great master, an old master. Although Seppo has understood, is enlightened – but just to be enlightened is not enough. There are many dimensions to enlightenment. Tozan is trying to get Seppo to enter into another dimension. He knows isness, he knows thisness but he is not aware.\nThat awareness has no personality. Still it is, it has no limits to it. Isness is oceanic, it has no boundaries.\nIt is so beautiful just to hear enlightened people tricking each other into new dimensions of being. Question 1\nManeesha has asked:\nBELOVED OSHO,\nIS IT REALLY THIS EASY?\nManeesha, easy is not the word because it brings the idea of difficulty. However easy, it is still difficult. However close, it is still far. Your being is neither difficult nor easy, it simply is. It is not your achievement, you are it.\nQuestion 2\nManeesha has asked another question:\nGANTO SEEMS TO BE SAYING THAT SEPPO BECAME ENLIGHTENED, CAME TO LIFE IN THE SAME WAY THAT HE DID. IS IT TRUE THAT THE REALIZATION OF ENLIGHTENMENT IS THE SAME FOR EVERYONE?\nThe ultimate experience is certainly the same. But the paths are millions. Somebody comes from the North and somebody comes from the South. One river comes from the Himalayas, another river comes from other mountains. But they all reach, big or small, to the same ocean.\nThe ultimate experience is the same but people differ in their uniqueness. Hence their ways of revealing themselves to themselves are different. Everybody is born in the same way but everybody does not die in the same way.\nBirth is not in your hands. When you awaken, you are already born. It is not a question for you to decide to be born or not to be born. But death is a different matter. You can die unconsciously, you can die consciously, you can die joyously, you can die dancingly. You can make a joke of death itself. The birth is the same but the death has to be unique.\nBut most people are born in the same way and die in the same way. Both are unconscious. But remember, if birth and death – the two ends – are unconscious, then that which is in between – the life – cannot be conscious. It is a long sleep from the cradle to the graveyard.\nVery few are fortunate enough to reach to their grave knowingly, consciously. And the moment a person reaches to his death consciously, there is no death at all.\nDeath exists only for unconscious people. For the conscious one, death is only a change of time and space, a change of form. But the essence remains the same.\nSeppo has made you serious. A little laughter before we enter into meditation.\nBarbara Bustline is about to undergo a minor operation. She has been prepared and wheeled along the corridor to the doors of the operating room, where the nurse leaves her to check if the surgery staff are ready.\nThe nurse has just left, when a young man in a white coat comes up to the trolley. Lifting the sheet, he begins to examine Barbara’s naked body very carefully.\nThen he nods reflectively and walks away.\nThen a second man in a white coat comes along, lifts the sheet and examines her too.\nBut when a third man, similarly dressed, comes along and does the same, Barbara becomes impatient.\n“It is all very well examining me,” she says irritably, “but when are they going to start the operation?” “I have no idea,” replies the man, “we are just painting the corridor.”\nDoctor Pinchbottom, the White House medical man, is giving the president and the first lady their annual checkup. The doctor examines Ronald Reagan first, and finds him to be in good health for a man in his condition.\n“And how do you feel?” asks Pinchbottom.\n“Great,” replies Reagan, “Life is so great that even when I go to the bathroom at night, God turns on the light for me.”\nDoctor Pinchbottom is puzzled but does not say anything, and starts examining Nancy Reagan. When he is finished, he asks her, “Tell me, is it true about God turning on the bathroom light for Ronald at night?”\n“Oh, no!” says Nancy, “he is just pissing in the fridge again.”\nSam Shekel, the sharp, middle-aged company director, is a great believer in efficiency. One day, he hangs up a sign in the main office, which reads: “DO IT NOW!”\nWithin the next few hours, the cashier disappears with the contents of the company safe; Sam’s secretary elopes with his eldest son; most of the staff take the day off; the office boy throws a bottle of red ink into the air-conditioner, and then catches the next plane to Poona.\nHe must be here somewhere!\nNow it is time to have a small daily meditation. Nivedano...\n(Drumbeat)\nYou start gibberish. (Gibberish) Nivedano... (Drumbeat)\nYou be silent, absolutely silent. Gather your energy within yourself. This is what Seppo means by ‘This’.\nThis... the bamboos, as usual, are giving their commentary. Nivedano...\n(Drumbeat) Relax, let go.\nThis... even the bamboos have become silent. Nivedano...\n(Drumbeat)\nYou come back.\nOkay, Maneesha?\nYes, Osho.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2981","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/this_this_a_thousand_times_this_the_very_essence_of_zen/part2/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/this_this_a_thousand_times_this_the_very_essence_of_zen/>This, This, A Thousand Times This.

the commentaries of the bamboos are really honest, sincere and to the
point.</p><p><br></p><p>Seppo would have loved this assembly, this moment of silent waiting.
He was not as fortunate as I am. He had very few disciples but that is
very unjust of existence. Seppo should have had the whole world as his
disciples because what he is giving is the ultimate essence.</p><p><br></p><p>(THE CHIRPING OF BIRDS RUNS THROUGH THE SILENCE OF BUDDHA HALL.)</p><p><br></p><p>This was Seppo.</p><p><br></p><p>They have all gathered here.</p><p><br></p><p>This story makes Seppo’s method of teaching clear:</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN SEPPO WAS LIVING IN HIS HERMITAGE, TWO MONKS CAME TO PAY THEIR
RESPECTS. AS SEPPO SAW THEM COMING HE PUSHED OPEN THE GATE AND,
PRESENTING HIMSELF BEFORE THEM, SAID, “WHAT IS THIS?”</p><p><br></p><p>The monks must have been at a loss. In fact, Seppo’s opening the
gate, standing before them, was a question to be asked by them. But
before they had said anything Seppo himself without being questioned,
asked, “What is this?”</p><p><br></p><p>In utter confusion those two monks said to Seppo, “What is this? We
have not even asked, we have not even entered the gate, we have not even
said hello to you and you open the gate, and standing before us
irrationally ask, ‘What is this?’ In fact, we ask you about your
behavior, ‘WHAT IS THIS?’”</p><p><br></p><p>They missed the point. SEPPO LOWERED HIS HEAD AND RETURNED TO HIS
COTTAGE. This lowering of the head of the master is a deep sadness about
the misunderstanding these two monks have shown. And he returned to his
cottage because there is no point in saying anything more. He has
already said more than is absolutely essential. This becomes clear –
that he has already said more.</p><p>LATER THE MONKS CAME TO GANTO WHO SAID, “WHERE ARE YOU FROM?”</p><p><br></p><p>Ganto was Seppo’s master.</p><p><br></p><p>THE MONKS ANSWERED, “WE HAVE COME FROM SOUTH OF THE NANREI
MOUNTAINS.” GANTO SAID, “HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO SEE SEPPO?”</p><p>THE MONKS SAID, “YES, WE HAVE BEEN TO HIM.” GANTO SAID, “WHAT DID HE
SAY TO YOU?”</p><p>THE MONKS RELATED THE WHOLE STORY.</p><p><br></p><p>GANTO SAID, “ALAS! I REGRET THAT I DID NOT TELL HIM THE LAST WORD
WHEN I WAS WITH HIM. IF I HAD DONE SO, NO ONE IN THE WHOLE WORLD COULD
HAVE PRETENDED TO OUTDO HIM.”</p><p><br></p><p>AT THE END OF THE SUMMER SESSION, THE MONKS REPEATED THE STORY AND
ASKED GANTO FOR HIS INSTRUCTION.</p><p><br></p><p>GANTO SAID, “WHY DIDN’T YOU ASK EARLIER?”</p><p><br></p><p>THE MONKS SAID, “WE HAVE HAD A HARD TIME STRUGGLING WITH THIS
TOPIC.”</p><p><br></p><p>GANTO SAID, “SEPPO CAME TO LIFE IN THE SAME WAY THAT I DID, BUT HE
DOES NOT DIE IN THE SAME WAY THAT I DO. IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE LAST
WORD, I WILL TELL YOU SIMPLY – THIS! THIS!”</p><p><br></p><p>Ganto is saying that to ask, “What is this?” is not exactly right.
The existence cannot be questioned, it cannot be a ‘what’. It simply is,
without any question and without any answer.</p><p><br></p><p>Simply ‘this’.</p><p><br></p><p>This small anecdote converging in the smallest possible word, ‘this’,
gives you the very essence of religiousness – the mystery of it, the
beauty of it, the truth of it. You cannot answer and you cannot ask, you
have simply to live; to live thisness – in Gautam Buddha’s words
suchness, tathata – is the whole of religious consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>Just live this moment in its totality, without wavering; neither
thinking of the past which is no more, nor projecting about the future
which is not yet.</p><p><br></p><p>All that you have is the purity of thisness, this moment.</p><p><br></p><p>And the glory and the ecstasy cannot be higher, cannot be deeper if
you can understand the simple experience of thisness.</p><p><br></p><p>Setcho’s commentary on it: THE LAST WORD, LET ME TELL YOU – LIGHT AND
DARKNESS INTERMINGLED,</p><p>LIVING IN THE SAME WAY, YOU ALL KNOW; DYING IN DIFFERENT WAYS –
BEYOND TELLING! ABSOLUTELY BEYOND TELLING!</p><p><br></p><p>BUDDHA AND DHARMA ONLY NOD... Buddha and Bodhidharma – Dharma is a
short form of Bodhidharma. BUDDHA AND BODHIDHARMA ONLY NOD TO
THEMSELVES.</p><p><br></p><p>They utter not even the simplest word, this.</p><p><br></p><p>They simply nod. In their nodding is said everything sayable,
unsayable. In their nodding is the whole mystery of existence.</p><p><br></p><p>EAST, WEST, NORTH AND SOUTH – HOMEWARD LET US GO. LATE AT NIGHT,
SEEING THE SNOW ON THE THOUSAND PEAKS.</p><p><br></p><p>As I have told you before, Setcho is a great intellectual but he is
not an enlightened man. Once in a while, he makes a comment that is
beautiful, but it is coming out of his head rather than out of his
being. He is not accounted in the long line of buddhas. He remains only
a commentator. And a commentator, however great, is simply repeating,
paraphrasing the experience that is not his own.</p><p><br></p><p>I don’t want you to be commentators.</p><p><br></p><p>I want you to be in the very center of existence, of your being.</p><p><br></p><p>That is the only way to understand this tremendous mystery that
surrounds you. Another story...</p><p>SEPPO IS ALSO KNOWN AS HSUEH-FENG. SEPPO ONCE SPOKE OF AN INCIDENT
THAT CONTRIBUTED TO HIS AWAKENING:</p><p><br></p><p>“WHEN I ASKED MASTER TOKUSAN WHETHER I COULD SHARE THE EXPERIENCE
THAT THE ANCIENT MASTERS KNEW, HE STRUCK ME, AND I WAS LIKE A BUCKET
WHOSE BOTTOM HAD JUST DROPPED OUT.</p><p><br></p><p>GANTO UTTERED A WARNING ‘HO!’ AND ASKED, “DON’T YOU KNOW WHAT COMES
FROM WITHOUT IS NOT AS GOOD AS WHAT IS PRODUCED WITHIN? IF YOU WERE
REVEALING YOUR EXPERIENCE OF CH’AN, OR ZEN OR DHYAN, EVERYTHING THAT YOU
SAID OR DID WOULD FLOW DIRECTLY FROM THE CENTER OF YOUR INNERMOST BEING,
WHICH IN TURN WOULD EMBRACE AND PENETRATE THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE.”</p><p><br></p><p>UPON HEARING THIS SEPPO SUDDENLY WAS ENLIGHTENED AND MADE A DEEP BOW
TO GANTO.</p><p><br></p><p>These beautiful stories and these beautiful people have almost
disappeared from the world. They were not plastic and they were not
phony. They were utterly innocent, authentic. I want my people to bring
back those golden moments which have disappeared from the world.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a story about one of Seppo’s disciples named Tozan:</p><p>WHEN HE FIRST WENT TO SEPPO HE HAD HARDLY ENTERED THE GATE WHEN SEPPO
PUSHED HIM OVER AND SAID, “WHAT IS THIS?”</p><p><br></p><p>AND TOZAN WAS IMMEDIATELY ENLIGHTENED. FORGETTING HIMSELF HE JUST
LIFTED UP HIS HANDS AND DANCED AROUND. SEPPO SAID, “ARE YOU BEHAVING
RATIONALLY?”</p><p><br></p><p>TOZAN SAID, “WHAT HAS THIS TO DO WITH RATIONALITY?”</p><p><br></p><p>SEPPO STROKED HIS BACK AND CONFIRMED HIS ENLIGHTENMENT.</p><p><br></p><p>A dance can say much more than any philosophy. A simple shout ‘Ho’,
can bring you to this moment. Anything that can bring you to your home
is the only religion I know of. The so-called religions of the world are
simply deceiving and exploiting people. People have to be awakened.</p><p><br></p><p>Zen has become my most beloved for the simple reason that it does not
create any theology. It does not bother about God. Because God is always
that, God is always there. And the real concern is this, not that. here,
not there. now, not then.</p><p><br></p><p>SEPPO WAS CUTTING TREES ONE DAY WITH CHOSEI AND SAID TO HIM, “WHEN
YOU CUT, CUT TO THE HEART. THEN STOP.”</p><p><br></p><p>CHOSEI SAID, “I HAVE CUT AND FINISHED.”</p><p><br></p><p>SEPPO SAID, “FORMER MASTERS TRANSMITTED THE TRUTH FROM MIND TO MIND.
WOULD YOU REALLY SAY THAT YOU HAVE CUT AND FINISHED?”</p><p><br></p><p>CHOSEI SAID, “THROWING THE AXE TO THE GROUND, IT IS TRANSMITTED.”
SEPPO STRUCK HIM WITH HIS STICK.</p><p>It is out of tremendous love and great compassion that a Zen master
ever strikes anybody. This is a different language than saying that you
have got it, that you are enlightened.</p><p><br></p><p>A master’s stick is awaited by the disciple for years, because he
will hit you only if he knows that his hit is going to awaken you; or he
will hit only when you are awakened as a reward. In the modern world it
will not be at all understood. When, for the first time, Zen stories
were translated, everybody thought that they were some kind of
jokes.</p><p><br></p><p>They are not jokes. But because they were first translated by
Christian missionaries, it was just to show to the world: “Look at the
greatness of Christianity and look at these primitive people thinking
that they are enlightened.” But the whole thing misfired. These stories
were translated by Christian missionaries to prove Christianity’s
superiority.</p><p><br></p><p>But in fact, these stories – if understood, experienced – simply
prove that there cannot be anything superior to them. Their utter
innocence... just look at the disciple dancing. Because he has got it!
Just look at the master hitting the disciple as a reward.</p><p><br></p><p>This is possible only at the very heights of consciousness.</p><p>Man has progressed technologically, scientifically, but man has
forgotten the language of his own being. There is progress in gadgets,
but man is completely lost.</p><p><br></p><p>I want you to remember that your first task in life is to be fully,
wholly aware of yourself. Because without being totally aware, you will
never know the beauty and the splendor of this existence that surrounds
you. You will never know your birth, your death. You will never really
know that you ever lived.</p><p><br></p><p>Without being aware you are all somnambulists, walking in sleep,
talking in sleep. And you have become so accustomed to your sleep that
you can even do complicated things while you are completely asleep. You
can be efficient in doing certain jobs while snoring within your
being.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole world thinks that in the morning they wake up, and by the
evening they go to sleep again. It is sheer nonsense. Once you wake up,
you never go to sleep. So the waking in the morning is just fake, very
superficial. You have to learn the authentic awakening.</p><p><br></p><p>SEPPO WAS SAYING GOOD-BYE TO TOZAN WHO ASKED HIM, “WHERE ARE YOU OFF
TO?” SEPPO ANSWERED, “I AM GOING BACK TO REICHU.”</p><p>“AT THAT TIME, WHAT ROAD DID YOU COME BY?” ASKED TOZAN. “BY HIENREI,”
ANSWERED SEPPO.</p><p>“AND BY WHAT ROAD ARE YOU GOING BACK?” ASKED TOZAN. “THE SAME ROAD,”
SEPPO ANSWERED.</p><p>“DO YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW THE ONE WHO NEVER LEAVES IS HIENREI, THE
ROAD?”</p><p><br></p><p>People come and go, the road remains.</p><p><br></p><p>Tozan is reminding Seppo, “Don’t be a coming and going, but be a
remaining. There is nowhere to go, you are already there. Just realize
it.”</p><p><br></p><p>SEPPO SAID, “I DON’T KNOW THAT ONE THAT REMAINS.” “WHY NOT?” ASKED
TOZAN.</p><p>“BECAUSE THE ONE HAS NO PERSONALITY,” ANSWERED SEPPO.</p><p><br></p><p>TOZAN SAID, “YOU SAY THAT YOU DON’T KNOW THAT ONE. IF SO, HOW DO YOU
KNOW THAT THE ONE HAS NO PERSONALITY?”</p><p><br></p><p>These dialogues are so totally different from the dialogues of
Socrates and Plato. Beautiful dialogues, very rational, but these
dialogues are simply of another world, of another consciousness.</p><p>Tozan is a great master, an old master. Although Seppo has
understood, is enlightened – but just to be enlightened is not enough.
There are many dimensions to enlightenment. Tozan is trying to get Seppo
to enter into another dimension. He knows isness, he knows thisness but
he is not aware.</p><p><br></p><p>That awareness has no personality. Still it is, it has no limits to
it. Isness is oceanic, it has no boundaries.</p><p><br></p><p>It is so beautiful just to hear enlightened people tricking each
other into new dimensions of being. Question 1</p><p>Maneesha has asked:</p><p><br></p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>IS IT REALLY THIS EASY?</p><p><br></p><p>Maneesha, easy is not the word because it brings the idea of
difficulty. However easy, it is still difficult. However close, it is
still far. Your being is neither difficult nor easy, it simply is. It is
not your achievement, you are it.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2</p><p><br></p><p>Maneesha has asked another question:</p><p><br></p><p>GANTO SEEMS TO BE SAYING THAT SEPPO BECAME ENLIGHTENED, CAME TO LIFE
IN THE SAME WAY THAT HE DID. IS IT TRUE THAT THE REALIZATION OF
ENLIGHTENMENT IS THE SAME FOR EVERYONE?</p><p><br></p><p>The ultimate experience is certainly the same. But the paths are
millions. Somebody comes from the North and somebody comes from the
South. One river comes from the Himalayas, another river comes from
other mountains. But they all reach, big or small, to the same
ocean.</p><p><br></p><p>The ultimate experience is the same but people differ in their
uniqueness. Hence their ways of revealing themselves to themselves are
different. Everybody is born in the same way but everybody does not die
in the same way.</p><p><br></p><p>Birth is not in your hands. When you awaken, you are already born. It
is not a question for you to decide to be born or not to be born. But
death is a different matter. You can die unconsciously, you can die
consciously, you can die joyously, you can die dancingly. You can make a
joke of death itself. The birth is the same but the death has to be
unique.</p><p><br></p><p>But most people are born in the same way and die in the same way.
Both are unconscious. But remember, if birth and death – the two ends –
are unconscious, then that which is in between – the life – cannot be
conscious. It is a long sleep from the cradle to the graveyard.</p><p><br></p><p>Very few are fortunate enough to reach to their grave knowingly,
consciously. And the moment a person reaches to his death consciously,
there is no death at all.</p><p>Death exists only for unconscious people. For the conscious one,
death is only a change of time and space, a change of form. But the
essence remains the same.</p><p><br></p><p>Seppo has made you serious. A little laughter before we enter into
meditation.</p><p><br></p><p>Barbara Bustline is about to undergo a minor operation. She has been
prepared and wheeled along the corridor to the doors of the operating
room, where the nurse leaves her to check if the surgery staff are
ready.</p><p><br></p><p>The nurse has just left, when a young man in a white coat comes up to
the trolley. Lifting the sheet, he begins to examine Barbara’s naked
body very carefully.</p><p><br></p><p>Then he nods reflectively and walks away.</p><p><br></p><p>Then a second man in a white coat comes along, lifts the sheet and
examines her too.</p><p><br></p><p>But when a third man, similarly dressed, comes along and does the
same, Barbara becomes impatient.</p><p><br></p><p>“It is all very well examining me,” she says irritably, “but when are
they going to start the operation?” “I have no idea,” replies the man,
“we are just painting the corridor.”</p><p>Doctor Pinchbottom, the White House medical man, is giving the
president and the first lady their annual checkup. The doctor examines
Ronald Reagan first, and finds him to be in good health for a man in his
condition.</p><p><br></p><p>“And how do you feel?” asks Pinchbottom.</p><p><br></p><p>“Great,” replies Reagan, “Life is so great that even when I go to the
bathroom at night, God turns on the light for me.”</p><p><br></p><p>Doctor Pinchbottom is puzzled but does not say anything, and starts
examining Nancy Reagan. When he is finished, he asks her, “Tell me, is
it true about God turning on the bathroom light for Ronald at
night?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh, no!” says Nancy, “he is just pissing in the fridge again.”</p><p><br></p><p>Sam Shekel, the sharp, middle-aged company director, is a great
believer in efficiency. One day, he hangs up a sign in the main office,
which reads: “DO IT NOW!”</p><p>Within the next few hours, the cashier disappears with the contents
of the company safe; Sam’s secretary elopes with his eldest son; most of
the staff take the day off; the office boy throws a bottle of red ink
into the air-conditioner, and then catches the next plane to Poona.</p><p><br></p><p>He must be here somewhere!</p><p>Now it is time to have a small daily meditation. Nivedano...</p><p>(Drumbeat)</p><p><br></p><p>You start gibberish. (Gibberish) Nivedano... (Drumbeat)</p><p>You be silent, absolutely silent. Gather your energy within yourself.
This is what Seppo means by ‘This’.</p><p>This... the bamboos, as usual, are giving their commentary.
Nivedano...</p><p>(Drumbeat) Relax, let go.</p><p>This... even the bamboos have become silent. Nivedano...</p><p>(Drumbeat)</p><p><br></p><p>You come back.</p><p><br></p><p>Okay, Maneesha?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, Osho.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part1>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

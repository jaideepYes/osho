FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT HE KEPT ON SAYING, “WORK FOR ME IN THE FIELD, AND I WILL TEACH FOR YOU.”\nHE THUS MADE HIS DISCIPLES WORK IN THE FIELD ALL THE TIME; BUT HE DID NOT SEEM TO BE PREPARED TO GIVE ANY LECTURES OR SERMONS.\nFINALLY, THE MONKS, NOT ABLE TO STAND IT ANY LONGER, WENT TO THE MASTER AND ASKED: “WOULD YOU PLEASE BE GRACIOUS ENOUGH TO GIVE US AN EDIFYING SERMON?”\nTHE MASTER’S UNWAVERING REPLY WAS: “WORK FOR ME IN THE FIELD, AND I WILL TEACH FOR YOU.”\nSEVERAL DAYS PASSED, AND THE IMPATIENT MONKS WENT TO THE MASTER AGAIN AND URGED: “PLEASE GIVE US A SERMON.” THIS TIME, HE QUITE READILY AGREED TO DO SO.\nAFTER A WHILE ALL THE MONKS GATHERED TOGETHER IN THE HALL. THE MASTER QUIETLY APPEARED BEFORE THEM, WALKED UP TO THE PULPIT, SPREAD OUT BOTH HIS ARMS, AND WITHOUT A WORD IMMEDIATELY RETURNED TO HIS ROOM.\nONE DAY NANSEN WAS WORKING ON THE MOUNTAIN WITH A SICKLE. A MONK CAME UP THE MOUNTAIN PATH AND ASKED, WITHOUT KNOWING TO WHOM HE WAS TALKING: “HOW CAN I GET TO MASTER NANSEN?”\nTHE MASTER RAISED HIS SICKLE IN FRONT OF THE MONK, AND SAID: “I PAID THIRTY CENTS FOR THIS SICKLE.”\nTHE MONK RETORTED: “I DID NOT ASK YOU ABOUT THE SICKLE.” “WHAT, THEN,” QUERIED THE MASTER, “DID YOU ASK ME?”\nTHE MONK REPEATED: “HOW CAN I GET TO MASTER NANSEN?” THE MASTER SAID, “OH, YES! THIS CUTS WELL!”\nManeesha, this gesture by Hyakujo is the greatest sermon delivered in the whole history of mysticism. Just to prepare his people he used to say, “Go and work in the field. You cannot work with the trees and with the grass and with the roses for long without yourself becoming as silent as they are.”\nThe people who live with nature naturally find a synchronicity between themselves and the rivers and the mountains, they are closer to the earth and its heartbeat.\nHyakujo first tried to bring the disciple close to nature, close to silence. Unless he is prepared, the great sermon cannot be delivered. A great sermon needs great disciples, and a great disciple is exactly one who is silent.\nBefore I enter into the tremendously beautiful story of Hyakujo I would like to tell you something about a contemporary master, George Gurdjieff. He used to use – without knowing Hyakujo – the same method, and the people who came to him were very different than the people who came to Hyakujo.\nGurdjieff was working in the West. Intellectuals would come and Gurdjieff would ask them to go and dig a ditch in the field, but they would say, “We have come here to learn something, not to dig a ditch.” Gurdjieff was very hard. He would say, “First do what I say if you want to hear the answer.”\nIn one particular case, Bennet reached Gurdjieff: highly educated, cultivated and the answer to him was the same. He had come to ask about God and the meaning of life. Gurdjieff said, “These things leave for the moment, just go and dig the ditch in the field.”\nBennet hesitated for a moment, but then thought, “I have come from so far, let us see what happens. What am I going to lose?” He started digging the ditch; Gurdjieff came with his cigar, watched him digging, told him that, “Before sunset this certain area has to be prepared.”\nThe sunset came, Bennet was utterly tired – an intellectual who has never worked, and particularly this kind of work. And seeing the sun setting there was a great relief...”Now, at last Gurdjieff will start having the dialogue I have come for.” Gurdjieff was walking just by the side, watching all the time.\nThen Bennet said, “The ditch is ready.”\nGurdjieff said, “Now refill the ditch completely, bring it back to its original state, throw all the mud back in its place.”\nBennet was so tired, but he was also a man of integrity. He said, “Let us see what happens.”\nWithout food, without rest, without even a coffee break he filled the ditch again. It was almost the middle of the night and Gurdjieff was standing the whole day just watching and smoking his cigar. The moon was full, at the highest peak of the night; it was a beautiful silence and Bennet remembers that, “I was so tired... I don’t know from where – a tremendous silence descended over me.” In his autobiography he says, “I was simply astonished.”\nGurdjieff laughed and said, “Have you heard? Now go and rest.”\nBut what was said? Nothing was said. The question is not that the master should say anything. The question is that the disciple should be so silent... and he was silent because he was so tired that he could not even think, the mind became utterly empty. In that silence there is no need for the master to say anything, he can just indicate it as this, and the sermon is over.\nBut Hyakujo goes even further than Gurdjieff. He did not even say, “This.” He forced his disciples to work to the optimum, where their energy was completely absorbed by the work and the mind had nothing, no energy to contain its chattering. Again and again disciples came to him, but he would simply repeat, “Go and work in the field.”\nBut one day those who had remained with this strange man who teaches nothing, who simply says, “Go back to the field and work as hard as possible...”\nAnd he was known to be one of the great masters who knows the secret. Many came, but only a few remained. He was a difficult man.\nWhen only those few remained who had become silent working in the fields, who had come to a deep harmony with nature, whose minds had settled down, he accepted the invitation.\nTHIS TIME – after many efforts of the disciples to invite the master and getting the same reply, “Go back and work in the field” – this time when they came and asked, “PLEASE GIVE US A SERMON,”\nHE QUITE READILY AGREED TO DO SO.\nAFTER A WHILE ALL THE MONKS GATHERED TOGETHER IN THE HALL. THE MASTER QUIETLY APPEARED BEFORE THEM, WALKED UP TO THE PULPIT, SPREAD OUT BOTH HIS ARMS AND , WITHOUT A WORD , IMMEDIATELY RETURNED TO HIS ROOM.\nThis is known in the history of Zen as the greatest sermon. It is, because he said nothing and yet he said everything. Those two hands spread like a bird’s wings opened the whole sky to the silent disciples, a transmission without words.\nWe have become too much accustomed to words, we don’t know the beauty of wordlessness. Even if you see a beautiful rose, immediately your mind says, “How beautiful,” and you have missed. If you had simply seen the rose and absorbed its beauty, felt it in your heart without uttering even a single word in appreciation, you would have become enlightened.\nEven a rose could have functioned as a great master to you.\nThe question is not that you don’t know, the question is, you are too full of gibberish, you know too much. Because of your borrowed knowledge and too many words moving inside you, you cannot see the wordless beauty that can only be experienced in silence. Just listen to the bamboos... and you will find what Hyakujo has said without saying it.\nZen is not an intellectual effort to understand reality, it is an intuitive approach to drown in the mystery of existence, to open your wings and fly like an eagle across the sun.\nLanguage is a very small phenomenon, limited to humanity. The stars don’t speak nor the flowers, but they still express, they transmit their very being without any language. Zen is just a wildflower, spreading its fragrance to whomsoever it may concern. Those who have the sensitivity will understand it.\nNothing is being said and everything is understood. Just drown yourself into thisness, the tremendous silence of the moment, and you will feel freedom from the mind. And that is the only freedom, the first and the last freedom, freedom from the mind.\nIt is your own mind that is covering your being like a cage. Once the mind is left behind and you are just a watcher, far away... suddenly the doors of all the mysteries open.\nZen does not talk about God, it gives you God; it does not talk about paradise, it pushes you into paradise.\nQuestion 1\nManeesha has asked... BELOVED OSHO,\nA FEW MINUTES JABBERING NONSENSE, A FEW MORE MINUTES OF SILENCE, AND THEN JUST TOTALLY RELAXING. THIS SIMPLE MEDITATION OR EXERCISE PUTS ME IN A STATE OF SUCH DELICIOUS, IRRATIONAL JOY THAT FOR SEVERAL MOMENTS I AM UTTERLY CONTENT, ABSOLUTELY HAPPY TO BE MYSELF AS I AM, IN A WORLD EXACTLY AS IT IS. THIS IS WHAT MOST PEOPLE SPEND THEIR ENTIRE LIFE PURSUING.\nPRESUMABLY, THIS IS WHY PEOPLE TAKE DRUGS, HAVE LOVE-AFFAIRS, MARRY AND HAVE CHILDREN; JUST FOR THIS, THAT WE RENEGADES EXPERIENCE AT THE FEET OF THE MOST DANGEROUS MAN IN THE WORLD. ANYTHING TO SAY?\n(OSHO SPREADS OUT BOTH HIS ARMS AND REMAINS SILENT.)\nRemember the two hands of Hyakujo. Nothing to say.\nYour silence is enough unto itself, it does not need anything more. It is more than you could have ever dreamt of.\nThe second story Maneesha has brought...\nONE DAY NANSEN WAS WORKING ON THE MOUNTAIN WITH A SICKLE.\nNansen was one of the greats. I count him with Gautam Buddha, Mahakashyap, Bodhidharma, Joshu, Hyakujo. There have been thousands of masters, but Nansen will still stand out with his own beauty, uniqueness. He became so well known to the people that the very mountain where he had a small cottage is now called Mount Nansen.\nONE DAY NANSEN WAS WORKING ON THE MOUNTAIN WITH A SICKLE. A MONK CAME UP THE MOUNTAIN PATH AND ASKED, WITHOUT KNOWING TO WHOM HE WAS TALKING, “HOW CAN I GET TO MASTER NANSEN?”\nTHE MASTER RAISED HIS SICKLE IN FRONT OF THE MONK, AND SAID: “I PAID THIRTY CENTS FOR THIS SICKLE.”\nTHE MONK RETORTED: “I DID NOT ASK YOU ABOUT THE SICKLE.” “WHAT, THEN,” QUERIED THE MASTER, “DID YOU ASK ME?”\nTHE MONK REPEATED, “HOW CAN I GET TO MASTER NANSEN?” THE MASTER SAID, “OH, YES! THIS CUTS WELL!”\nYou see the effort of bringing the monk to the present. It does not matter what it is, it may be the sickle – at this moment Nansen is trying to bring the monk, the stranger, to the present moment. But the monk goes on asking about something far away.\nZen is not a philosophy for far away things, it is a very realistic approach to the present – and every means and method is being used to bring seekers to the moment. Ordinarily, intellectually the story will look absurd, that’s why people like Nansen and Hyakujo have disappeared from the world. We have become too intellectual and they were non-intellectuals, innocent, tremendously present, integrated, but always here; you cannot push them anywhere else. You cannot take them out of their moment.\nNow Nansen is working with the sickle, you cannot make him talk about anything else, even about himself.\nI hope you will understand the point. The monk missed. It is easy to miss Zen.\nIt is so obvious that if you simply\ndon’t start your mind, just for a moment\nit is in your hands. It is neither difficult nor is it simple.\nIt is just the case,\nit is your very being.\nYou may be acquainted with it or not – it is there, just like your shadow. But the shadow is outside; your being is your inner center. And except to be present, here and now, there is no way to it. This is the only path that leads to oneself.\nQuestion 2\nManeesha is asking again:\nBELOVED OSHO,\nYOU SPEAK SO HIGHLY OF THE ZEN MASTERS, THEIR INGENIOUS AND YET SIMPLE METHODS, AND THE INNOCENCE OF THE KIND OF PEOPLE WHO COULD BECOME REALIZED THROUGH THEM. YET WHILE I DO SOMETIMES SEE YOU AS A ZEN MASTER, I WOULD NOT SAY YOUR APPROACH IS CHARACTERISTIC OF THEIRS. IS THAT BECAUSE THE KIND OF PEOPLE YOU HAVE ARE TOO CEREBRAL, ARE SO MUCH OUT OF CONTACT WITH INNOCENCE AND SPONTANEITY, OR IS IT THAT YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IS MOST EFFECTIVE... OR BOTH?\nManeesha,\n(OSHO SPREADS OUT BOTH HIS ARMS)\n... both. I am myself a category in itself. I will not stand in any queue, even with Gautam Buddha. I love my aloneness, my own spontaneity. That makes a difference.\nSecondly, the people I am with are totally different from the people the Zen masters had to deal with. The Zen masters, if present here, would look simply insane to you. I am trying to make their insanity as sane as possible so that you can understand.\nYou are different, you are more in the head than the people Zen masters were dealing with. So my effort is to first bring you to your heart and only then can I have a silent dialogue with you. I have to speak to create silence in you. It is a very contradictory way.\nBut before you fall into a deeper silence, throbbing with joy, peace, the contentment of which Maneesha has been speaking... that is not only her experience, that is the experience of most of my people here and around the world.\nThe bamboos will also be happy to hear you laugh a little.\nSeamus is leaning on the bar in the pub, when Paddy comes in with a perfect black eye. “Hey, Paddy!” says Seamus, “That’s a beautiful black eye you have there. Who hit you?” “As a matter of fact,” says Paddy, after ordering a beer, “Fergus O’Reilly hit me.”\n“My God!” says Seamus, “with what?”\n“Well, as a matter of fact,” replies Paddy, “he had a wooden stick in his hand.” “And I suppose,” remarks Seamus, “that you did not have anything in your hand?”\n“As a matter of fact,” says Paddy, sipping his beer, “I had in my hand Kathie O’Reilly’s left breast, an object of great beauty – but no use in a fight!”\nOne day, Kowalski walks into the circus manager’s office and says,\n“I have got a great act to show you. I can do a swallow dive from one hundred feet onto solid ground.”\nThe circus manager is skeptical but agrees to see the act. So they go into the big tent and Kowalski climbs up the ladder to the top. Then he does a perfect dive to the ground. He lands on his head with a terrific crunch, but then gets up, rubbing himself and groaning softly.\nThe manager runs over to him and says, “That was amazing! The most incredible act I have ever seen! I will give you five hundred dollars a night!”\nKowalski shakes his head. So the manager says, “Okay, just name your price and I will pay it!” “I am sorry,” replies Kowalski, “I don’t want to do it again. I had no idea it would hurt so much!” Now enter into real Zen. First beat the drum, Nivedano, and everybody gets into gibberish. (Drumbeat)\n(Gibberish) Nivedano... (Drumbeat)\nEverybody gets into absolute silence, no movement, gather your energy inwards and look within. This is the no-word answer of Hyakujo.\nAnd this is the sickle of Nansen that cuts really well. Nivedano...\n(Drumbeat) Relax.\nNivedano... (Drumbeat)\nPlease come back.\nOkay, Maneesha?\nYes, Osho.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"2648","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/this_this_a_thousand_times_this_the_very_essence_of_zen/part3/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/this_this_a_thousand_times_this_the_very_essence_of_zen/>This, This, A Thousand Times This.

side, watching all the time.</p><p><br></p><p>Then Bennet said, “The ditch is ready.”</p><p><br></p><p>Gurdjieff said, “Now refill the ditch completely, bring it back to
its original state, throw all the mud back in its place.”</p><p>Bennet was so tired, but he was also a man of integrity. He said,
“Let us see what happens.”</p><p><br></p><p>Without food, without rest, without even a coffee break he filled the
ditch again. It was almost the middle of the night and Gurdjieff was
standing the whole day just watching and smoking his cigar. The moon was
full, at the highest peak of the night; it was a beautiful silence and
Bennet remembers that, “I was so tired... I don’t know from where – a
tremendous silence descended over me.” In his autobiography he says, “I
was simply astonished.”</p><p><br></p><p>Gurdjieff laughed and said, “Have you heard? Now go and rest.”</p><p><br></p><p>But what was said? Nothing was said. The question is not that the
master should say anything. The question is that the disciple should be
so silent... and he was silent because he was so tired that he could not
even think, the mind became utterly empty. In that silence there is no
need for the master to say anything, he can just indicate it as this,
and the sermon is over.</p><p><br></p><p>But Hyakujo goes even further than Gurdjieff. He did not even say,
“This.” He forced his disciples to work to the optimum, where their
energy was completely absorbed by the work and the mind had nothing, no
energy to contain its chattering. Again and again disciples came to him,
but he would simply repeat, “Go and work in the field.”</p><p><br></p><p>But one day those who had remained with this strange man who teaches
nothing, who simply says, “Go back to the field and work as hard as
possible...”</p><p><br></p><p>And he was known to be one of the great masters who knows the secret.
Many came, but only a few remained. He was a difficult man.</p><p><br></p><p>When only those few remained who had become silent working in the
fields, who had come to a deep harmony with nature, whose minds had
settled down, he accepted the invitation.</p><p><br></p><p>THIS TIME – after many efforts of the disciples to invite the master
and getting the same reply, “Go back and work in the field” – this time
when they came and asked, “PLEASE GIVE US A SERMON,”</p><p><br></p><p>HE QUITE READILY AGREED TO DO SO.</p><p><br></p><p>AFTER A WHILE ALL THE MONKS GATHERED TOGETHER IN THE HALL. THE MASTER
QUIETLY APPEARED BEFORE THEM, WALKED UP TO THE PULPIT, SPREAD OUT BOTH
HIS ARMS AND , WITHOUT A WORD , IMMEDIATELY RETURNED TO HIS ROOM.</p><p><br></p><p>This is known in the history of Zen as the greatest sermon. It is,
because he said nothing and yet he said everything. Those two hands
spread like a bird’s wings opened the whole sky to the silent disciples,
a transmission without words.</p><p><br></p><p>We have become too much accustomed to words, we don’t know the beauty
of wordlessness. Even if you see a beautiful rose, immediately your mind
says, “How beautiful,” and you have missed. If you had simply seen the
rose and absorbed its beauty, felt it in your heart without uttering
even a single word in appreciation, you would have become
enlightened.</p><p><br></p><p>Even a rose could have functioned as a great master to you.</p><p>The question is not that you don’t know, the question is, you are too
full of gibberish, you know too much. Because of your borrowed knowledge
and too many words moving inside you, you cannot see the wordless beauty
that can only be experienced in silence. Just listen to the bamboos...
and you will find what Hyakujo has said without saying it.</p><p><br></p><p>Zen is not an intellectual effort to understand reality, it is an
intuitive approach to drown in the mystery of existence, to open your
wings and fly like an eagle across the sun.</p><p><br></p><p>Language is a very small phenomenon, limited to humanity. The stars
don’t speak nor the flowers, but they still express, they transmit their
very being without any language. Zen is just a wildflower, spreading its
fragrance to whomsoever it may concern. Those who have the sensitivity
will understand it.</p><p><br></p><p>Nothing is being said and everything is understood. Just drown
yourself into thisness, the tremendous silence of the moment, and you
will feel freedom from the mind. And that is the only freedom, the first
and the last freedom, freedom from the mind.</p><p><br></p><p>It is your own mind that is covering your being like a cage. Once the
mind is left behind and you are just a watcher, far away... suddenly the
doors of all the mysteries open.</p><p><br></p><p>Zen does not talk about God, it gives you God; it does not talk about
paradise, it pushes you into paradise.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 1</p><p><br></p><p>Maneesha has asked... BELOVED OSHO,</p><p>A FEW MINUTES JABBERING NONSENSE, A FEW MORE MINUTES OF SILENCE, AND
THEN JUST TOTALLY RELAXING. THIS SIMPLE MEDITATION OR EXERCISE PUTS ME
IN A STATE OF SUCH DELICIOUS, IRRATIONAL JOY THAT FOR SEVERAL MOMENTS I
AM UTTERLY CONTENT, ABSOLUTELY HAPPY TO BE MYSELF AS I AM, IN A WORLD
EXACTLY AS IT IS. THIS IS WHAT MOST PEOPLE SPEND THEIR ENTIRE LIFE
PURSUING.</p><p><br></p><p>PRESUMABLY, THIS IS WHY PEOPLE TAKE DRUGS, HAVE LOVE-AFFAIRS, MARRY
AND HAVE CHILDREN; JUST FOR THIS, THAT WE RENEGADES EXPERIENCE AT THE
FEET OF THE MOST DANGEROUS MAN IN THE WORLD. ANYTHING TO SAY?</p><p><br></p><p>(OSHO SPREADS OUT BOTH HIS ARMS AND REMAINS SILENT.)</p><p><br></p><p>Remember the two hands of Hyakujo. Nothing to say.</p><p>Your silence is enough unto itself, it does not need anything more.
It is more than you could have ever dreamt of.</p><p>The second story Maneesha has brought...</p><p><br></p><p>ONE DAY NANSEN WAS WORKING ON THE MOUNTAIN WITH A SICKLE.</p><p><br></p><p>Nansen was one of the greats. I count him with Gautam Buddha,
Mahakashyap, Bodhidharma, Joshu, Hyakujo. There have been thousands of
masters, but Nansen will still stand out with his own beauty,
uniqueness. He became so well known to the people that the very mountain
where he had a small cottage is now called Mount Nansen.</p><p><br></p><p>ONE DAY NANSEN WAS WORKING ON THE MOUNTAIN WITH A SICKLE. A MONK CAME
UP THE MOUNTAIN PATH AND ASKED, WITHOUT KNOWING TO WHOM HE WAS TALKING,
“HOW CAN I GET TO MASTER NANSEN?”</p><p><br></p><p>THE MASTER RAISED HIS SICKLE IN FRONT OF THE MONK, AND SAID: “I PAID
THIRTY CENTS FOR THIS SICKLE.”</p><p><br></p><p>THE MONK RETORTED: “I DID NOT ASK YOU ABOUT THE SICKLE.” “WHAT,
THEN,” QUERIED THE MASTER, “DID YOU ASK ME?”</p><p>THE MONK REPEATED, “HOW CAN I GET TO MASTER NANSEN?” THE MASTER SAID,
“OH, YES! THIS CUTS WELL!”</p><p>You see the effort of bringing the monk to the present. It does not
matter what it is, it may be the sickle – at this moment Nansen is
trying to bring the monk, the stranger, to the present moment. But the
monk goes on asking about something far away.</p><p><br></p><p>Zen is not a philosophy for far away things, it is a very realistic
approach to the present – and every means and method is being used to
bring seekers to the moment. Ordinarily, intellectually the story will
look absurd, that’s why people like Nansen and Hyakujo have disappeared
from the world. We have become too intellectual and they were
non-intellectuals, innocent, tremendously present, integrated, but
always here; you cannot push them anywhere else. You cannot take them
out of their moment.</p><p><br></p><p>Now Nansen is working with the sickle, you cannot make him talk about
anything else, even about himself.</p><p><br></p><p>I hope you will understand the point. The monk missed. It is easy to
miss Zen.</p><p><br></p><p>It is so obvious that if you simply</p><p>don’t start your mind, just for a moment</p><p>it is in your hands. It is neither difficult nor is it simple.</p><p>It is just the case,</p><p><br></p><p>it is your very being.</p><p><br></p><p>You may be acquainted with it or not – it is there, just like your
shadow. But the shadow is outside; your being is your inner center. And
except to be present, here and now, there is no way to it. This is the
only path that leads to oneself.</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2</p><p><br></p><p>Maneesha is asking again:</p><p><br></p><p>BELOVED OSHO,</p><p><br></p><p>YOU SPEAK SO HIGHLY OF THE ZEN MASTERS, THEIR INGENIOUS AND YET
SIMPLE METHODS, AND THE INNOCENCE OF THE KIND OF PEOPLE WHO COULD BECOME
REALIZED THROUGH THEM. YET WHILE I DO SOMETIMES SEE YOU AS A ZEN MASTER,
I WOULD NOT SAY YOUR APPROACH IS CHARACTERISTIC OF THEIRS. IS THAT
BECAUSE THE KIND OF PEOPLE YOU HAVE ARE TOO CEREBRAL, ARE SO MUCH OUT OF
CONTACT WITH INNOCENCE AND SPONTANEITY, OR IS IT THAT YOU HAVE A
DIFFERENT UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IS MOST EFFECTIVE... OR BOTH?</p><p><br></p><p>Maneesha,</p><p><br></p><p>(OSHO SPREADS OUT BOTH HIS ARMS)</p><p><br></p><p>... both. I am myself a category in itself. I will not stand in any
queue, even with Gautam Buddha. I love my aloneness, my own spontaneity.
That makes a difference.</p><p><br></p><p>Secondly, the people I am with are totally different from the people
the Zen masters had to deal with. The Zen masters, if present here,
would look simply insane to you. I am trying to make their insanity as
sane as possible so that you can understand.</p><p><br></p><p>You are different, you are more in the head than the people Zen
masters were dealing with. So my effort is to first bring you to your
heart and only then can I have a silent dialogue with you. I have to
speak to create silence in you. It is a very contradictory way.</p><p><br></p><p>But before you fall into a deeper silence, throbbing with joy, peace,
the contentment of which Maneesha has been speaking... that is not only
her experience, that is the experience of most of my people here and
around the world.</p><p><br></p><p>The bamboos will also be happy to hear you laugh a little.</p><p>Seamus is leaning on the bar in the pub, when Paddy comes in with a
perfect black eye. “Hey, Paddy!” says Seamus, “That’s a beautiful black
eye you have there. Who hit you?” “As a matter of fact,” says Paddy,
after ordering a beer, “Fergus O’Reilly hit me.”</p><p>“My God!” says Seamus, “with what?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, as a matter of fact,” replies Paddy, “he had a wooden stick in
his hand.” “And I suppose,” remarks Seamus, “that you did not have
anything in your hand?”</p><p>“As a matter of fact,” says Paddy, sipping his beer, “I had in my
hand Kathie O’Reilly’s left breast, an object of great beauty – but no
use in a fight!”</p><p><br></p><p>One day, Kowalski walks into the circus manager’s office and
says,</p><p><br></p><p>“I have got a great act to show you. I can do a swallow dive from one
hundred feet onto solid ground.”</p><p><br></p><p>The circus manager is skeptical but agrees to see the act. So they go
into the big tent and Kowalski climbs up the ladder to the top. Then he
does a perfect dive to the ground. He lands on his head with a terrific
crunch, but then gets up, rubbing himself and groaning softly.</p><p><br></p><p>The manager runs over to him and says, “That was amazing! The most
incredible act I have ever seen! I will give you five hundred dollars a
night!”</p><p><br></p><p>Kowalski shakes his head. So the manager says, “Okay, just name your
price and I will pay it!” “I am sorry,” replies Kowalski, “I don’t want
to do it again. I had no idea it would hurt so much!” Now enter into
real Zen. First beat the drum, Nivedano, and everybody gets into
gibberish. (Drumbeat)</p><p>(Gibberish) Nivedano... (Drumbeat)</p><p>Everybody gets into absolute silence, no movement, gather your energy
inwards and look within. This is the no-word answer of Hyakujo.</p><p>And this is the sickle of Nansen that cuts really well.
Nivedano...</p><p>(Drumbeat) Relax.</p><p>Nivedano... (Drumbeat)</p><p>Please come back.</p><p><br></p><p>Okay, Maneesha?</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, Osho.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part2>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

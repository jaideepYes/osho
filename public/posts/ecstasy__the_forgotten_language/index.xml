‌CHAPTER 1
Now or never
11 December 1976 am in Buddha Hall
I. 13. mo ko kahan dhunro bande
O FRIEND, WHERE DOST THOU SEEK ME? LO! I AM BESIDE THEE.
I AM NEITHER IN TEMPLE NOR IN MOSQUE: I AM NEITHER IN KAABA NOR IN KAILASH: NEITHER AM I IN RITES AND CEREMONIES, NOR IN YOGA AND RENUNCIATION.
IF THOU ART A TRUE SEEKER, THOU SHALT AT ONCE SEE ME: THOU SHALT MEET ME IN A MOMENT OF TIME.</description>

‌CHAPTER 10
The choice is yours
20 December 1976 am in Buddha Hall
Question 1
ARE YOU THE ONLY ENLIGHTENED PERSON IN THIS ASHRAM? IF YES, IS IT IMPOSSIBLE TO ENLIGHTEN OR TO BE ENLIGHTENED NEAR AN ENLIGHTENED PERSON?
SINCE I BECAME ENLIGHTENED I have never come across a person who is not enlightened. You see only that which you are. Before I became enlightened, the same was the case with me – the whole world used to appear tremendously asleep, in darkness, in death, unenlightened, because you are reflected continuously everywhere.</description>

‌CHAPTER 2
Sannyas: the radical revolution
12 December 1976 am in Buddha Hall
Question 1
WHAT I MEAN BY SANNYAS IS A SPIRITUAL DISCIPLINE SO THAT ONE BECOMES A RELIGIOUS PERSON, BUT IT IS NOT HAPPENING TO ME. WHAT TO DO?
MY SANNYAS IS NOT A DISCIPLINE. My sannyas is freedom, freedom from all control – even from self-control. A controlled man is a dead man.</description>

‌CHAPTER 3
Natural, spontaneous, aware
13 December 1976 am in Buddha Hall
I. 63. avadhu, maya, taji na jay
TELL ME, BROTHER, HOW CAN I RENOUNCE MAYA?
WHEN I GAVE UP THE TYING OF RIBBONS, STILL I TIED MY GARMENT ABOUT ME. WHEN I GAVE UP TYING MY GARMENT, STILL I COVERED MY BODY IN ITS FOLDS. SO, WHEN I GIVE UP PASSION, L SEE THAT ANGER REMAINS</description>

‌CHAPTER 4
The way of religion
14 December 1976 am in Buddha Hall
Question 1
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A CRYSTALLIZED SELF AND A BIG, STRONG EGO?
THEY LOOK ALIKE, but they are as different as two things can be. Not only different, they are diametrically opposite. The crystallized self is not a self at all. It is called a crystallized “self,” but it is not a self at all.</description>

‌CHAPTER 5
There are no words to tell
15 December 1976 am in Buddha Hall
I. 104. aisa lo nahin tai sa, lo
O HOW MAY I EVER EXPRESS THAT SECRET WORD?
O HOW CAN I SAY HE IS NOT LIKE THIS, AND HE IS LIKE THAT? IF I SAY THAT HE IS WITHIN ME, THE UNIVERSE IS ASHAMED. IF I SAY THAT HE IS WITHOUT ME, IT IS FALSEHOOD.</description>

‌CHAPTER 6
Trust your nature
16 December 1976 am in Buddha Hall
Question 1
LIKE ALL OTHER INDIAN SAINTS, WHY DO YOU NOT LIKE TO BE THE SAINT OF THE MASSES?
I AM NOT AN INDIAN – nor am I an American or a Chinese. I don’t believe in countries and I don’t believe in any political divisions. Because of political divisions, humanity has suffered enough.</description>

‌CHAPTER 7
Enter into your own body
17 December 1976 am in Buddha Hall
Il. 22. man tu par utar kanh jaiho
TO WHAT SHORE WOULD YOU CROSS, O MY HEART? THERE IS NO TRAVELER BEFORE YOU, THERE IS NO ROAD.
WHERE IS THE MOVEMENT, WHERE IS THE REST, ON THAT SHORE? THERE IS NO WATER; NO BOAT, NO BOATMAN IS THERE;
THERE IS NOT SO MUCH AS A ROPE TO TOW THE BOAT, NOR A MAN TO DRAW IT.</description>

‌CHAPTER 8
The irrational rationalist
18 December 1976 am in Buddha Hall
THE Current OF 18TH DECEMBER HAS AN INTERVIEW WITH DR. ABRAHAM T. KOVOOR, EIGHTY-YEAR-OLD RATIONALIST AND ATHEIST, OF CEYLON, IN WHICH HE REFERS TO AND CRITICIZES YOU. WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY ABOUT IT?
R. ABRAHAM T. KOVOOR seems to be a nice old man, but a little senile. Senile, I call him, because a person cannot be both together – a rationalist and an atheist.</description>

19 December 1976 am in Buddha Hall
Il. 103. naco re mero man, matta hoy
DANCE, MY HEART! DANCE TODAY WITH JOY.
THE STRAINS OF LOVE FILL THE DAYS AND THE NIGHTS WITH MUSIC, AND THE WORLD IS LISTENING TO ITS MELODIES.
MAD WITH JOY, LIFE AND DEATH DANCE TO THE RHYTHM OF THIS MUSIC. THE HILLS AND THE SEA AND THE EARTH DANCE.</description>

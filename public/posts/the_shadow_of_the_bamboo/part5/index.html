The moment you land in Japan you will start thinking of coming back to India!\nAnand Aurora. Anand means bliss, aurora means dawn – the dawn of bliss. Sannyas can become the dawn of bliss it depends on you, it all depends on you. If it becomes a commitment it can transform you totally. If it remains only a formality then nothing happens through it. Only when you are committed to something totally does your heart start functioning. The formal remains in the head, only the love affair reaches to the heart; and it is only when something reaches to the heart that it changes, that it transmutes.\nSannyas has to be a commitment, a deep involvement, a love affair. It can bring the dawn.\nPeople ordinarily live in a dark night of the soul. In fact they have never seen the light so they think that life is nothing but darkness. They have become accustomed to it; they take it for granted. They think it is all there is to life. It is not all, it is not even the beginning.\nThe darkness has to end. Only when you are full of light and when the inner sun has risen will your life have splendor, glory, meaning, significance. Then life is a song of immense beauty, of great music, of tremendous benediction.\nLet sannyas go deeper in you, and much is possible through it. All that one can need is possible through it. Good.\nPrem Traute. Prem means love. Trust is the fragrance of love; without love there is no trust. It is only through the immense courageousness of love that one can trust. Doubt is very cowardly; and the mind that is not in love is bound to be in doubt. It is only in love that doubt disappears.\nLove is like light and doubt is like darkness. When you bring the light in the darkness disappears. And in this light you can see a few things which were not available before. They were there but they were hidden, covered by darkness; now the light starts revealing them.\nExactly the same is the case in the inner world of consciousness. Doubt is darkness. It does not allow you to see who you are. It does not allow you to see the treasure that you are carrying within yourself. It does not allow you to see the grandeur of your being, the immortality of your soul, the divinity of your existence.\nOnce love arises, darkness disappears, doubts disappear. Then you can see who you are. That seeing is trust. Trust is not a belief: it is an experience.\nSatyam Jonathan. Satyam means truth, jonathan means a gift of God – truth, the gift of God. Truth is not something that we can create: it is, it is already given. We can keep our eyes closed or we can open our eyes, that is our freedom but truth is a gift of God.\nTruth is not arrived at by logical thinking it has nothing to do with the mind. Truth means that which is. So all that is needed is not great thinking but a state of silence so that we can see that which is without any interference of thought; so we can see it without any barrier of thought; so that we can see without any bias, without any prejudice, without any a priori concept; so we can see without being a Christian or a Hindu or a Buddhist; so that we can simply see with no idea to impose on it.\nWhen the mind is in a state of no-thinking, when thinking is suspended, the mind becomes a mirror, and in that mirror, truth reflects. Truth is already here. God has given it already. This whole existence is his truth; we need not seek and search for it. On the contrary, we have to drop all seeking, all searching, and we have to learn the ways of being still and silent. When you are still, silent, you know. Knowing happens in silence, not in thinking.\nDharma means the fundamental law of existence, hence in the East religion is called dharma because religion is the fundamental law of existence. Dharma exactly means what tao or logos means: that which keeps the existence together, that which runs like a thread in this multiplicity of existence. Things don’t fall apart; existence is not just a heap of flowers, it is a garland. The thread is not visible but the thread is keeping all the flowers in a certain system. The existence is not a chaos, it is a cosmos; and the principle of the cosmos is dharma.\nIf you are in tune with it, blessings shower on you; if you are not in tune with it, you create misery for yourself. There is not some person like God who sits there in the high heaven judging you, punishing you, rewarding you. That is not the eastern concept. God is not a person but a principle. Nobody is needed to judge: the law is enough unto itself. If you remain in harmony with the law, you are rewarded; nobody rewards you but you are rewarded. If you are in a discord, nobody punishes you but you are punished.\nMichael means one who is godlike. [Dharma Michael] will mean the fundamental principle of life that can make you godlike. And that is the goal of every being: to become godlike. Again, let me remind you, by God I don’t mean a person. To be godlike simply means to be utterly blissful, ecstatic. To be godlike simply means having no anxiety, no anguish, no tension. That tranquility, that utter peace, that peace that surpasses understanding, that’s what makes one godlike.\nThe principle is simple: be in harmony with nature, don’t go against it. Whenever you feel miserable, find out: somewhere you have gone against nature. Whenever you find yourself blissful, again search: knowingly, unknowingly, you have fallen in tune with existence.\nThis is how slowly slowly one discovers the fundamental law of life. It is not in the Bible, it is not in the Koran, it is not in the Vedas you have to discover it on your own. It is by trial and error that one discovers the true law.\nVeet Masaru. Veet means going beyond, masaru means superiority. Superiority is not against inferiority, it is the other side of the same coin. They exist together they are two poles of one phenomenon called comparison. If you compare, then either you feel superior or you feel inferior. And it is a relative phenomenon: you may feel superior in comparison to one person and you may feel inferior in comparison to another person. There are millions of people in the world – you will become too burdened. If you feel inferior, it is bad; it hurts. If you feel superior, it is egoistic; it makes you vain. In both ways you suffer.\nOne has to go beyond both. That is the meaning of your name: go beyond superiority, inferiority – go beyond comparison. You are just yourself there is nobody else like you, so comparison is not possible. Can you compare a pebble with a rose-flower? They are unique; there is no comparison possible. Can you compare a man with a tree? Or a river with a mountain? You don’t compare because you know they are different.\nIn fact each individual person is so different from everybody else that no comparison is possible. Nobody is superior and nobody is inferior; everybody is just himself. To understand that brings great freedom.\nAnand Kiyoshi. Anand means bliss, kiyoshi means pure – pure bliss. Bliss is pure when it comes from your innermost core, when it wells up within you; then it is uncontaminated, unpolluted. Anything that comes from the outside cannot be so pure. The very journey that it has to make from the outside to the inside makes it impure. Happiness is impure; it comes from the outside. You have to depend on somebody for it, and that is the very cause of impurity: the dependence. But bliss is not dependent on anybody it is simply your nature.\nPeople are lost in the search for happiness. First, it is very difficult to attain; second, if by some miracle it happens, then it is impure, it is not satisfying. Only pure bliss can give you contentment. And the strange thing is that we go on looking for it on the outside while it is always waiting inside.\nTurn in – that is the message of sannyas.\nAnand means bliss, purnima means full-moon night – a full-moon night of bliss. The moon represents the most blissful phenomenon, the most beautiful. One can become that beauty, that\nsplendor. It is within our reach; we can hold the moon in our hearts. Go ing to the moon is just useless. Far more significant is the process of bringing the moon in. It can be brought in. It can become a guest if you are ready to become a host. And when your inner being is full of moonlight great bliss starts happening.\nThe whole process of meditation is to release the imprisoned splendor within you, to release the imprisoned light within you.\nWe are carrying great potential, utterly unaware, oblivious of it. Just the hard shell that surrounds it has to be broken. It is painful to break that hard shell, but once you are ready to allow that much pain, to go through that much pain, and once the shell is broken, life takes a quantum leap. You are no more a mortal you become an immortal. You are no more darkness; you become a full-moon night. And you know no misery any more. Even if you want to, you cannot be miserable. Bliss simply becomes your nature, your very existence.\nCome back again. This has to be done, this has to happen: your name has to become your reality too!\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"1754","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_shadow_of_the_bamboo/part5/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_shadow_of_the_bamboo/>The Shadow of the Bamboo</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">5</h1><div class=post-meta>9 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1754 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Shadow_of_the_Bamboo/part5.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part4>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

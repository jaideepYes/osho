John means a gift of God and satyam means the ultimate truth. To know the truth is to attain the ultimate fulfillment. That is the greatest possible gift. God makes it available to everybody but very few people receive it. God is not at fault. People are very miserly in opening up, in opening their heart lotuses. They remain closed, hence they go on missing the gift.\nTruth is not something logical; it is not a conclusion of a thought process. It is the experience of this moment, of all that is, the experience of being – just that one is. That penetrating experience of is-ness is truth. It is available, it has always been available. Not even for a single moment is it missing, but we are not available to it.\nSannyas simply means the art of becoming available to God. God is already available.\nSamvedan Eduard. Samvedan means sensitivity, eduard means rich. The only way to God is rich sensitivity, multi-dimensional sensitivity.\nPeople are living very insensitive lives. They are living behind hard shells. They have grown the hard shells as a protection, but now those hard shells are killing them. They are encaged in their own defense arrangements.\nTo know God one has to be defenseless, one has to drop all armor; one has to be vulnerable. And it is not only the condition to know God; it is the condition to know all that is beautiful, all that is poetic, all that is musical, all that is contained in the word “love”.\nSensitivity gives you many dimensions to grow in. You start growing in every possible dimension, on every possible plane. Religions up to now have been teaching just the opposite: they have been\nteaching people to be indifferent to life, to be indifferent tO beauty. They have been teaching very poisonous ideologies.\nMy approach is just the opposite. I teach you love for life, love for beauty, love for all that God has made available. This beautiful existence has to be lived in its totality. Because of life negativity, all the old religions helped man to become more and more insensitive, because that was the only way to repress.\nIf you become sensitive, repression disappears, you cannot repress. And a totally sensitive person, because he has no repression, has no unconscious either. The unconscious mind is a by product of repression. The division is needed. The conscious is the one who represses, and the unconscious is the one that is repressed. Once there is no repression, the division disappears: you are simply one. That unity brings benediction. That unity is meditation.\nBecome more and more sensitive to everything that is – to the wind, to the rain, to the sun, to people, to animals, to birds, to trees. To everything that is, become more sensitive, available, open. Breathe more, see more, listen more, feel more. That will bring richness. That is the only richness.\nReal richness does not consist of money. That is only a way of hiding your poverty. Real richness consists of a singing heart, of a celebrating being.\nDeva Kuno. Deva means divine, kuno means intelligence – divine intelligence. Kuno also means courage. Intelligence and courage go together. The intelligent person is necessarily courageous. The courageous person may not necessarily be intelligent but the intelligent person is necessarily courageous.\nThe intelligent person seeks new challenges in life because it is only through challenges that one grows. The intelligent person never escapes from any responsibility, because if you escape, you are escaping from life itself. That is a way of committing slow suicide. The intelligent person does not fight with existence; it is only the stupid who fight. The intelligent person becomes alert and aware of one of the most fundamental things – that we are part of existence, so there can be no conflict. We should live a life of harmony, with nature, with the universe, with all that is. That harmony brings joy, that harmony brings immortality, that harmony brings truth. All that mind desires and cannot achieve simply descends in your being if you are ready to be in harmony with existence.\nTo be in conflict is to be in misery; to be in tune with existence is to be in bliss. That is the only proof of an intelligent person – that he should be blissful. Bliss is the criterion.\nEvery person is born intelligent; it is the society that makes him stupid. Every child is full of intelligence, great intelligence, but the society does not allow intelligence. It cripples intelligence, it destroys it. On the contrary, it helps robots, mechanical behavior, discipline, obedience. These are all ways of creating subtle slavery.\nSannyas is the declaration of your freedom. it is initiation into freedom, initiation into intelligence, initiation into courage.\nAnand Alfred. Anand means bliss, alfred means wise, supernaturally wise. Blissful, supernatural wisdom – that will be the full meaning of your name.\nWisdom is always blissful. It is never sad, it is never serious. It is always cheerful. It has the same cheerfulness as children have. Hence sages have some quality of children – the same innocence, the same bubbling joy, that same flavor of utter happiness for no reason at all. And wisdom is always supernatural.\nIntellect functions in the world of nature; intuition functions in the world that is beyond nature. And it is intuition that gives you wisdom, not your intellect. It is not the head that creates wisdom; it is the heart. And the ways of the heart are not of nature, hence they are not available to science. The heart is absolutely unavailable to scientific methods: mathematics, calculation, observation – nothing helps there. Its way is something transcendental. One can live it, but one cannot observe it from the outside.\nWisdom is a flowering in you which is not part of your body. It happens in the body and yet it is not part of your body. It is a flame of the beyond.\nSo remember three things. One is: never be serious, otherwise you will not be able to reach to the true wisdom. Knowledgeability will be possible but not wisdom. Second, remember: man does not end at nature. He is more than nature; he is nature plus. Never forget that, because if you forget that, if you reject that, then you become confined to nature. Then science is all and there is no possibility of any religion.\nAnd thirdly, remember that these things – wisdom, bliss, intuition – are existential. You have to search within your own being you cannot observe them. Even if you meet a Buddha, you will not be able to recognise him. Unless something inside you has happened you will not be able to recognise anything on the outside. These are not theories to be understood, but experiences.\nIf these three things are remembered, one starts moving in the right direction. That movement is meditation: the movement from the head towards the heart, the movement from seriousness to blissfulness, the movement from nature to supernature.\n[A sannyasin had had a heart attack and was in hospital. He says it was a fantastic experience, and he loved doing Vipassana. However now he is out of hospital his old habits are coming back.]\nIt has done something which cannot be undone. It has been a really beautiful experience, a spiritual experience.\nSometimes blessings come in disguise so it is very difficult to recognize them. Many times because we cannot recognize them, we miss them, but you did recognize it, and the curse became a blessing!\nIt is going to remain with you the change cannot be erased. Faith has arisen, trust is born; and trust always arises only in such difficult challenging situations, otherwise not. It has been really good. I am happy!\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"1330","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_shadow_of_the_bamboo/part28/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_shadow_of_the_bamboo/>The Shadow of the Bamboo</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">28</h1><div class=post-meta>7 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1330 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Shadow_of_the_Bamboo/part28.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part27>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

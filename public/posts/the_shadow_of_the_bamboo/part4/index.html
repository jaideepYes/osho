Deva means divine, helen means light – divine light. Light represents the manifest part of God; darkness represents the unmanifest part. Both are divine, but darkness is the seed and light is the flower; darkness is the womb, light is the child.\nMeditate on light, and the more you meditate on light, the more you will be surprised that something inside starts opening, as if a bud is opening and becoming a flower.\nMeditation on light is one of the most ancient meditations. In all the ages, in all the countries, in all the religions, it has been emphasized for a particular reason, because the moment you meditate on light, something inside you that has remained a bud starts opening its petals. The very meditation on light creates the space for its opening.\nSo let that be your meditation: whenever you have time, close your eyes, visualize light. Wherever you see light, be in tune with it; just don’t go on ignoring it. Be worshipful towards it. It may be a sunrise, it may be just a candle in the room, but be prayerful towards it, and you will gain much.\nGreat is the benediction if one continues feeling in tune with light.\nJuppy. Anand means bliss, juppy means added by God – bliss, added by God. Bliss always comes from God. It cannot be manufactured by us. At the most we can only receive it gracefully; we are to be receivers. We cannot grab it; and the more one wants to grab it, the more it eludes. The deliberate seeker after bliss is going to fail utterly. Each of his efforts will bring more and more frustration. He has taken a wrong step from the very beginning. Bliss has not to be searched for; one has to wait for it. One has to be patient – expectant but not aggressive.\nThat is the meaning of juppy: God will increase, God will add, God will give. Just prepare the way for him, just be a ready receiver. Become a womb, be feminine.\nPrem means love, michael means godlike. It is love that makes a man godlike, and it is only love, nothing else can do it. Love is the greatest magic. It transforms the mundane into the sacred; it transforms prose into poetry.\nOrdinarily people are living their lives like prisoners, dragging somehow, as if life is a sentence to be suffered. Love transforms it and makes it a song to be sung.\nThink of love, feel more and more, meditate on love and bring love to every act that you do. Soon you will be delivered with a key that opens all the locks of existence; but that is possible only when one has learned the way of love. It is not difficult because it is our very nature. We are born to love and to be loved.\nDeva Eric. Deva means divine, eric means one who is always a king, ever a king, one whose very nature is kingly. There are people on whom things can be imposed from without. They can be made kings, great leaders, heroes, but inside they are just the opposite. That is not their true nature, they are just playing a role. They may become very efficient in playing it. Not only will they be able to deceive others, they may even be able to deceive themselves, but still the role remains a role; they are acting a part.\nEric means one who is naturally a king; not playing a role, that’s how he is. That’s a beautiful word. Everybody is naturally a king because we are born of God – how can we be otherwise? This existence has given you immense respect, otherwise you would not have been here. This existence has needed you, needs you, hence you are. This is our natural kingship.\nJesus talks about it again and again: The kingdom of God is within you. He is talking about your natural quality of being a king. If you are behaving like a beggar then you must be playing a role, must have learned from others; the society must have taught you to be a beggar.\nSannyas is an effort to undo what the society has done to you so that the natural is revealed again; and the revelation of the natural is the greatest joy possible.\nAnand Uli. Anand means blissful, uli means a ruler, a king – a blissful king. You are not yet... but you can be! And if you are not, nobody else is responsible except yourself. It is your birthright but you have not claimed it; it is your treasure but you have neglected it. It is yours just for the asking.\nJesus says: Knock and the doors shall be opened, ask and it shall be given. But we don’t even ask for that which is ours. In fact we are more interested in things which are not ours. We are interested in things which are others’, and we go on asking for those things. That’s how a man goes on rushing from this point to that, desiring this and desiring that, never really asking for that which is already his. Once you know it, once you have it, you will be fulfilled. You can have all the things the world can provide and you will still remain unfulfilled, because that will not help your nature to grow; it may even hinder it. The more possessions a man has, the more he becomes possessed by his own possessions – burdened, worried. k does not make him really blissful, on the contrary it creates anxiety.\nA blissful person is one who possesses his own self, one who is a ruler of his own being. That dimension, of being a master of oneself, is the dimension of sannyas.\nAnand Isabel. Anand means blissful, isabel means goddess – a blissful goddess. That’s how I see you all. You have to learn to see yourself in the same way, and not only yourself but everyone else too. It is only on the surface that people are not gods. The deeper we penetrate into them, the more godly they are. The devil exists only on the surface. The devil is the circumference and God is the center; and we have to look at the center because that is from where we really live.\nTo forget the center and to become too obsessed with the circumference is the misery of life. To live rooted in the center is the beginning of transformation, because once you become aware of your center, your circumference also starts changing – because it becomes luminous. It starts taking on the color and the light and the music of the center. It becomes a mirror: it reflects the center. And when the center and the circumference are in harmony then one is in the state of rejoicing. Then one has arrived home.\nAnand means bliss. In Greek megs means pearl, but it is basically derived from Persian. In Persian it means moonlight, born of moonlight. In Persian poetry pearls are thought to be nothing but dew- drops born out of moonlight. It is a beautiful name.\nMan can become a pearl, a precious pearl, but that is only a possibility. One can miss it too, and ninety-nine point nine percent of people miss it. They remain simply dewdrops; they never become pearls because they never become crystallized enough. They never become centered enough, they never become alert, aware enough, to pass through the transformation.\nBe aware! A man without awareness is not yet born. He is only just on the verge of being born. If he becomes aware, he will be born; if he does not become aware, he will die – and will be born again and will remain hanging on the verge again, and so on, so forth. Millions of times you were born, but you never crossed the crucial boundary. This time, take the jump.\nLet sannyas become a reality in your life, not just a formality. It is a scientific lab that you are entering into; my work is alchemical. If you are courageous enough to go into it, the dewdrop can be transformed into a pearl of great price. This is a great opportunity – you can use it; you can miss it. If you become conscious and start using whatsoever is available here, if you start using my energy that is available here, it is going to happen: you will be born again, you will become a twice-born. And then one is really a human being.\n[A sannyasin, leaving, asks: Master, how am I going to build a world?]\nI will, I will – don’t be worried. Simply go there, laughing and loving, and everything will be as you want it to be, there will be no trouble. This is my observation of thousands of people: if you trust, everything settles. Nothing ever goes wrong, and if something goes wrong that simply shows that some doubt was there that created it. On a trusting person the whole existence pours itself in help.\nSo just be loving, be trusting, and go joyously, and you will be surprised: the same world is no more the same. And then come back – this is your home now!\nKeep it (a box) with you, and whenever you need me just put it on the heart. And help people... you have to help many people towards me. Good.\n[A sannyasin couple are present. The man asks: I’m very puzzled in the relationship with my wife. We have a very smooth relationship – no great highs and no great lows, and we don’t have great sexual experiences. We’re very puzzled by it whether it’s right, if we are bored, if it’s okay.\nOsho checks their energy.]\nGood. There is nothing to be worried about, Mm? Just forget about the highs and the lows. It is very smooth, and because there is no trouble, sometimes one can start wondering whether one is bored or what? But there is nothing, nothing of boredom at all.\nIf there is boredom, it automatically takes you to the low; boredom cannot remain smooth. Boredom is a negative quality. If you are bored with each other you will become angry, you will become this and that, but boredom is bound to take you into trouble.\nBut things are very smooth. It is just a brotherly, sisterly love affair, but very good! Enjoy it!\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"1776","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_shadow_of_the_bamboo/part4/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_shadow_of_the_bamboo/>The Shadow of the Bamboo</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">4</h1><div class=post-meta>9 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1776 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Shadow_of_the_Bamboo/part4.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part3>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

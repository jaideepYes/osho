ALSO MEDITATE ON ONE WHO HAS ATTAINED DESIRELESSNESS.\nTHE MIND BECOMES TRANQUIL BY CULTIVATING ATTITUDES OF FRIENDLINESS TOWARDS THE HAPPY, COMPASSION TOWARDS THE MISERABLE, JOY TOWARDS THE VIRTUOUS AND INDIFFERENCE TOWARDS THE EVIL.\nMANY THINGS HAVE TO be understood before you can understand this sutra. First, the natural attitudes: whenever you see somebody happy, you feel jealous – not happy, never happy. You feel miserable. That’s the natural attitude, the attitude that you have already got. And Patanjali says the mind becomes tranquil by cultivating attitudes of friendliness towards the happy – very difficult. To be friendly with someone who is happy is one of the most difficult things in life.\nOrdinarily, you think it is very easy. It is not! Just the opposite is the case. You feel jealous, you feel miserable. You may show happiness, but that’s just a facade, a show, a mask. And how you can be happy? And how you can be tranquil, silent, if you have such an attitude?\nBecause the whole life is celebrating, millions of happinesses happening all over the universe, but if you have an attitude of jealousy, you will be miserable, you will be in a constant hell. And you will be in a hell precisely because all over there is heaven. You will create a hell for you – a private hell – because whole existence is celebrating.\nIf somebody is happy, what comes first to your mind? – as if that happiness has been taken from you, as if he has won and you are defeated, as if he has cheated you... Happiness is not a competition, so don’t be worried. If somebody is happy, it does not mean that you cannot be happy, that he has taken happiness – now how you can be happy. Happiness is not somewhere existing, which can be exhausted by happy people.\nWhy you feel jealous? If somebody is rich, maybe it is difficult for you to be rich because riches exist in a quantity. If somebody is powerful in a material way, it may be difficult for you to be powerful because power is a competition. But happiness is not a competition. Happiness exists in infinite quantity. Nobody has ever been able to exhaust it; there is no competition at all. If somebody is happy, why you feel jealous? And with jealousy enters hell in you.\nSays Patanjali, when somebody is happy, feel happy, feel friendly. Then you also open a door towards happiness. In a subtle way, if you can feel friendly with someone who is happy, you immediately start sharing his happiness; it has become yours also – immediately ! And happiness is not someTHING; it is not material. It is not something that somebody can cling to. You can share it. When a flower blooms, you can share it; when a bird sings, you can share it; when somebody is happy, you can share it. And the beauty is that it does not depend on his sharing. It depends on your partaking.\nIf it depended on his sharing, whether he shares or not, then it was totally a different thing. He may not like to share. But this is not a question at all, it does not depend on his sharing. When the sun rises in the morning you can be happy, and the sun cannot do anything about it. It cannot prevent you being happy. Somebody is happy: you can be friendly. It is totally your own attitude, and he cannot prevent you by sharing. Immediately you open a door, and his happiness flows towards you also.\nThis is the secret of creating a heaven all around you, and only within heaven can you be tranquil. How can you be tranquil in hell-fire? And nobody is creating it: you create it. So the basic thing to be understood is that whenever there is misery, hell, you are the cause of it. Never throw the responsibility on anybody else because that throwing of responsibility is escaping from the basic truth.\nIf you are miserable, only you – absolutely only you – are responsible. Look within and find the cause of it. And nobody wants to be miserable. If you can find the cause within you, you can throw it out. Nobody is standing in your way to prevent you. There is not a single obstacle to be happy.\nBut by being friendly towards happy people, you become attuned to happiness. They are flowering; you become friendly. They may not be friendly; that is none of your concern. They may not even\nknow you – that doesn’t matter. But wherever there is a blooming, wherever there is bliss, wherever somebody is flower-ing, wherever somebody is dancing and is happy and is smiling, wherever there is celebration, you become friendly, you partake of it. It starts flowing within you, and nobody can prevent it. And when there is happiness all around you, you feel tranquil.\nTHE MIND BECOMES TRANQUIL BY CULTIVATING ATTITUDES OF FRIENDLINESS TOWARDS THE HAPPY...\nWith the happy, you feel jealous – in a subtle competition. With happy people, you feel yourself inferior. You always choose people around you who are unhappy. You become friendly with unhappy people because with unhappy people you feel superior. You always seek somebody who is below you. You are always afraid of the higher; you always seek the lower, and the more you seek the lower, the lower you fall. Then even more lower people are needed.\nSeek the company of those who are higher than you – higher in wisdom, higher in happiness, higher in tranquility, calmness, quiet, collectedness: always seek the company of the higher because that is the way how you become higher, how you transcend the valleys and reach to the peaks. That becomes a ladder. Always seek the company of the higher, the beautiful, the happy – you will become more beautiful, you will become more happy.\nAnd once the secret is known, once you know how one becomes more happy, how with others’ happiness you create a situation for yourself also to be happy, then there is no barrier; then you can go as far as you like. You can become a god where no unhappiness exists.\nWho is a god? A god is one who has learned the secret to be happy with the whole universe, with every flower and with every river and with every rock and every star, who has become one with this continuous eternal celebration, who celebrates, who doesn’t bother whose celebration is this. Wherever there is a celebration, he participates. This art of participating in happiness is one of the foundations if you want to be happy. It has to be followed.\nJust the opposite you have been doing: if somebody is happy, immediately you are shocked. How is it possible? How come you are not happy and he has become happy? There is injustice. This whole world is cheating you and there is no God. If God is, how come you are not happy and others are becoming happy? And these people who are happy, they are the exploiters, they are tricky, cunning. They live on your blood. They are sucking others’ happiness.\nNobody is sucking anybody’s happiness. Happiness is such a phenomenon, there is no need to suck it. It is an inner flowering; it doesn’t come from the outside. Just by being happy with happy people you create the situation in Which your own inner flower starts blooming:\nTHE MIND BECOMES TRANQUIL BY CULTIVATING ATTITUDES OF FRIENDLINESS...\nYou create the attitude of enmity. You can feel friendly with a sad person, and you think it is very virtuous. You can feel friendly with someone who is depressed, in misery, and you think it is something religious, something moral you are doing, but what are you doing, you don’t know.\nWhenever you feel friendly with someone who is sad, depressed, unhappy, miserable, you create misery for you. It looks very irreligious, Patanjali’s attitude. It is not, because when you will\nunderstand his whole standpoint you will see what he means. He is very scientific. He is not a sentimental person, and sentimentality won’t help you.\nOne has to be very very clear:\n... COMPASSION TOWARDS THE MISERABLE...\nNot friendliness – compassion. Compassion is a different quality; friendliness is different. Friendliness means you are creating a situation in which you would like to be the same as the other person is, you would like to be the same as your friend. Compassion means that someone has fallen from his state. You would like to help him, but you would not like to be like him. You would like to give him a hand; you would like to bring him up, cheer him up. You would like to help him in every way, but you would not like to be like him because that is not a help.\nSomebody is crying and weeping, and you sit by the side and you start crying and weeping: are you helping him? In what way? Somebody is miserable and you become miserable; are you helping him? You may be doubling his misery. He was alone miserable; now there are two persons miserable. But in showing sympathy to the miserable you are again playing a trick. Deep down, when you show sympathy to the miserable – and remember, sympathy is not compassion; sympathy is friendliness. When you show sympathy and friendliness to a depressed, sad, miserable person, deep down you are feeling happy. Always there is an undercurrent of happiness. It has to be so because it is a simple arithmetic: when somebody is happy, you feel miserable, then how it is possible when somebody is miserable you can feel unhappy? Somebody is happy you feel miserable; then somebody is unhappy, deep down you feel very happy.\nBut you don’t show it. Or;, if you are observed acutely even you show it – even in your sympathy there is a subtle current of happiness. You feel good; you feel cheered up really, that it is not you who is unhappy, and you are in a position to show sympathy – and you are higher, superior.\nPeople always feel good when they can show sympathy to others; they are always cheered. Deep down they feel that they are not so miserable, thank God When somebody dies, immediately an undercurrent in you comes that you are still alive, thank God. And you can show sympathy and it costs nothing. Showing sympathy costs nothing, but compassion is a different thing. Compassion means you would like to kelp the other person; you would like to do whatsoever can be done; you would like to help him to come out of his misery. You are not happy about it, but you are not miserable also.\nAnd just between the two exists compassion: Buddha is in compassion. He will not feel miserable with you because that is not going to help anybody, and he will not feel happy because there is no point in feeling happy. How can you feel happy when somebody is miserable? But he cannot feel unhappy also because that is not going to help. He will feel compassion. Compassion exists just in between these two. Compassion means he would like to help you to come out of it. He is for you, compassion means, but against your misery; he loves you, but not your misery. He would like to bring you up, but not your misery with you.\nWhen you are sympathetic you start loving the misery, not the man who is miserable. And if suddenly the man is cheered up and says, “Don’t bother,” you will feel shocked, because he never gave you a chance to be sympathetic and show him that how higher, superior and happy a being you are.\nDon’t be miserable with somebody who is miserable. Help him to come out of it. Never make misery an object of love; don’t give any affection to misery, because if you give affection and you make it an object of love, you are opening a door for it. Sooner or later you will become miserable. Remain aloof. Compassion means remain aloof Extend your hand, remain aloof, help – don’t feel miserable, don’t feel happy, because both are the same. When you feel miserable on the surface with somebody’s misery, deep down runs the current of being happy. Both have to be dropped. Compassion will bring you tranquility of the mind.\nMany people come to me; they are social reformers, revolutionaries, politicians, utopians, and they say, “How you can teach people meditation and silence when there is so much misery in the world?” They tell me, “This is selfish.” They would like me to teach people to be miserable with others who are miserable. They don’t know what they are saying but they feel very good – doing social work, social service, they feel very good. And if suddenly the world becomes a heaven, and God says, “Now everything will be okay,” you will find the social reformers and revolutionaries in absolute misery, because they will have nothing to do.\nKhalil Gibran has written a small parable. In a city, in a big city, there was a dog who was a preacher and a missionary, and he preached to other dogs that “Stop barking. We waste almost ninety-nine percent of our energy in barking unnecessarily. That’s why we have not been evolving. Stop barking unnecessarily.”\nBut it is difficult for dogs to stop barking. That is an in-built process. Really they feel happy only when they bark. It is a catharsis. They feel silent when they have barked. So, they listened to the leader – the revolutionary, the utopian, who was thinking of kingdom of gods, kingdom of dogs, somewhere in the coming future, where every dog is reformed and has become religious – no barking, no fighting, everything is silent... a pacifist, must have been – that missionary.\nBut dogs are dogs. They will listen to him and then they will say, “You are a great man, and whatsoever you say is true. But we are helpless, poor dogs. We don’t understand such big things.” So all the dogs felt guilty because they couldn’t stop. And they believed in the message of the leader, and he was right: rationally, they could follow. But what to do with the bodies? The bodies are irrational. Whenever there will be a chance – a sannyasin walking – they will bark: a policeman, a postman... because they are against uniforms.\nIt was almost impossible for them, and they had settled it that “That dog is a great man, and we cannot follow. He is like an avatar – something from the other shore. So we will worship him, but how can we follow him?n And that leader was always true to his word: he never barked. But one day everything failed. One night, dark night, the dogs decided that,”This great leader is always trying to convert us, and we never listen to him. At least once a year, on the birthday of the leader, we should keep complete fast: no barking – absolute silence – no matter how difficult. At least once a year we can do that,” they decided.\nAnd on that night not a single dog barked. The leader went from this corner to that, this street to that, to watch, because wherever dogs will be barking, he will preach. He started feeling very miserable because nobody is barking; the whole night completely silent, as if no dog exists... He went many places, watched, and by the midnight it was so impossible for him that he moved in a dark corner and barked!\nThe moment the other dogs heard that one has broken, they said, “Now there is no problem.” They didn’t know that the leader has done it. They thought one of them has broken the vow. But now it was impossible for them to contain; the whole city barked. The leader came out and he started preaching!\nThis will be the condition of your social revolution – aries, reformers, Gandhians, Marxists and others – all brands. They will be in such a difficulty if the world is really changed. If the world fulfills really the utopia of their minds and imaginations, they will commit suicide or they will go mad. Or they will start preaching just opposite, just the contradictory, just the opposite whatsoever they are preaching now.\nThey come to me and they say, “How you can tell people to be silent when the world is in such a misery?” They think first the misery has to be removed, then people will be silent? No, if people are silent misery can be removed, because only silence can remove the misery. Misery is an attitude. It is less concerned with material conditions, more concerned with the inner mind, the inner consciousness. Even a poor man can be happy, and once he is happy many things start falling in line.\nSoon he may not be a poor man, because how can you be poor when you are happy? When you are happy, the whole world participates with you. When you are unhappy, everything goes wrong. You create all around a situation which helps your unhappiness to be there. This is the dynamics of the mind. It is a self-defeating system. You feel miserable, then more misery attracts towards you. When more misery attracts you say, “How I can be silent? So much misery there.” Then even more misery is attracted toward you. Then you say, “It is impossible now. And those who say they are happy must be telling lies: these Buddhas, Krishnas, they must be telling lies. These Patanjalis, they must be liars, because it is possible, so much misery?”\nThen you are in a self-defeating system. You attract, and not only you attract for yourself: when one person is miserable, he helps others also to be miserable, because they are also fools like you. Seeing you in misery, they sympathize. When they sympathize, they become vulnerable. So it is just like that: one ill person infects the whole community.\nMulla Nasruddin’s doctor sent him a bill. It was too much. His child was ill: Nasruddin’s small son was ill. He phoned to the doctor that “This is too much.” The doctor said, “But I had to come nine times to see your son, so that has to be accounted for.” Nasruddin said, “And don’t forget that my son infected the whole village, and you have been earning a lot. In fact you should pay me something.”\nWhen one person is miserable, he infects. Misery is infectious just as happiness is infectious. Ar;d if you are vulnerable towards misery – as you are because you are always seeking unknowingly – your mind seeks misery, because with misery you feel sympathy; with happiness you feel jealous.\nMulla Nasruddin’s wife told me once that “If you are going to New Delhi – the winter is coming – you bring me a drop-dead coat.” I was surprised. I couldn’t follow what she means. I told her anyway, “I don’t know much about coats, but I have never heard. What is a drop-dead coat?” She said, “You never heard?” and started laughing and said, “A drop-dead coat is a coat, when you put it on, neighbors drop dead!”\nUnless others drop dead, you don’t feel alive. Unless others are in misery, you don’t feel happy. But how can you feel happy when others are unhappy, and how can you feel alive really when others are dead? We exist together. And sometimes you may be the cause of many people’s misery. Then you are earning a karma. You may not have directly hit them; you may not have been violent to them. Subtle is the law You need not be a murderer, but if simply you infect people by your misery, you are participating in it; you are creating misery. And you are responsible for it, and you will have to pay for it. Very subtle is the mechanism!.\nJust two, three days before it happened a sannyasin attacked Laxmi. You may not have observed that you all are responsible for it, because many of you have been feeling antagonism towards Laxmi. That sannyasin is just a victim, just the weakest link among you. He has expressed your antagonism, that’s all, and he was the weakest; he became the victim, and now you will feel that he is responsible. That’s not true. You participated. Subtle is the law!\nHow you participated? Deep down, whenever somebody managing – and Laxmi is managing things around here... There are many situations in which you will feel antagonistic, in which she will have to say no to you, in which you will feel hurt – it cannot be avoided – in which you feel that enough attention is not being paid to you, in which you feel that you are treated as if you are nobody. Your ego feels hurt and you feel antagonism.\nIf many people feel antagonism towards a person, then the weakest amongst them will become the victim; he will do something. He was the craziest amongst you, that’s right. But he alone is not responsible. If you have ever felt antagonism towards Laxmi, that is part and you have earned a karma, and unless you become so subtly aware you cannot become enlightened. Things are very complicated.\nNow in the West also, psychoanalysts have found that the whole family is responsible if one person goes mad – whole family! Now they think that the family has to be treated, not one person, because when one person goes mad that only shows that the whole family has inner tensions. This is the weakest of them all, so immediately he shows the whole thing, he becomes the expression of the whole family, and if you treat him it won’t help. In the hospital he may be okay: back home he will fall ill again because the whole family has inner tensions and this is the weakest.\nChildren suffer too much because of parents. They are fighting; they are always creating anxiety and tension around the house. The whole house exists not as a peaceful community, but as an inner war and conflict. The child is vulnerable more; the child starts behaving in eccentric ways – now you have an excuse that you are tense and worried because of the child. And now the father and mother both can be concerned with the child; they will take him to the psychoanalyst and the doctor, and they can forget their own conflict.\nAnd this child becomes a cementing force, if he is ill; then they have to pay more attention to him. And now they have an excuse why they are worried and tense and in anguish – because the child is ill – and they don’t know just the reverse is the case... BECAUSE they are worried, tense in conflict. The child is innocent, tender; he can be affected immediately, he has no protection around him yet. And if the child becomes really healthy, the parents will be in more difficulty – because then there is no excuse.\nThis is a community; you live here as a family. Many tensions are bound to be there, be aware. Be alert about those tensions because your tensions can create a force. They can become accumulative, and suddenly somebody who is weak, vulnerable, simple, may become the shelter of the accumulated force, and then he reacts in a way. Then you all can throw the responsibility on him. But that is not true if you ever have felt any antagonism, you are part of it. And the same is true in the greater world also.\nWhen Godase murdered Gandhi, I never said that Godase is responsible. He was the weakest link; that is true. But the whole Hindu mind was responsible, deep currents of Hindu antagonism against Gandhi. The feeling that he is for Moslems, Mohammedans, was accumulating. This is an actual phenomenon: antagonism becomes accumulated. Just like a cloud, it hovers, and then somewhere a weak heart, a very unprotected man, becomes the victim. The cloud gets roots into him and then the explosion. And then everybody is freed: Godase is responsible – murdering Gandhi – so you can kill Godase and be finished. Then the whole country moves in the same way, and the Hindu mind remains the same: no change. Subtle is the law!\nAlways find the dynamics of mind. Only then you will be transformed; otherwise not.\nTHE MIND BECOMES TRANQUIL BY CULTIVATING ATTITUDES OF FRIENDLINESS TOWARDS THE HAPPY, COMPASSION TOWARDS THE MISERABLE, JOY TOWARDS THE VIRTUOUS...\nLook! Patanjali is making steps – and beautiful and very subtle, but exactly scientific.\n... JOY TOWARDS THE VIRTUOUS, AND INDIFFERENCE TOWARDS THE EVIL.\nWhen you feel somebody is a virtuous man, joy, the ordinary attitude is that he must be deceiving. How anybody can be more virtuous than you? Hence so much criticism goes on.\nWhenever there is somebody who is virtuous, you immediately start criticizing, you start finding faults with him. Somehow or other you have to bring him down. He cannot be virtuous. You cannot believe this. Patanjali says joy, because if you criticize a virtuous man, deep down you are criticizing virtue. If you criticize a virtuous man, you are coming to a point to believe that virtue is impossible in this world. Then you will feel at ease. Then you can move on your evil ways easily because, “Nobody is virtuous; everybody is just like me – even worse than me.” That’s why so much condemnation goes on – criticism, condemnation.\nIf somebody says, “That person is a very beautiful person,” you immediately find something to criticize. You cannot tolerate – because if somebody is virtuous and you are not, your ego is shattered, and then you start feeling that “I have to change myself,” which is an arduous effort. The simple is to condemn; the simple is to criticize; the simple is to say, “No! Prove! What are you saying? First, prove how he is virtuous!” And it is difficult to prove virtue; it is very easy to unprove anything. It is very difficult to prove!\nOne of the greatest Russian storytellers is Turgenev. He has written a story. The story is that in a small village a man was thought to be stupid, and he was. And the whole town laughed at him. He was just like a fool, and everybody in the town enjoyed his foolishness. But he was tired of his foolishness, so he asked a wise man, “What to do?”\nThe wise man said, “Nothing! Simply, whenever somebody is praising somebody, you condemn. Somebody is saying that ‘That man is a saint,’ immediately say, ‘No! I know well he is a sinner!’ Somebody says, ‘This book is very great,’ immediately say, ‘I have read it and studied it.’ Don’t bother whether you have read it or not; simply say, ‘This is rubbish.’ If somebody is saying, ‘This painting is one of the greatest works of art,’ simply say, ‘But what it is? – just a canvas and colors. A child can do it!’ Criticize, say no, ask for proofs, and after seven days come to me.”\nWithin seven days the town started feeling that this man is a genius: “We never knew about his talents, and he is a genius about everything. You show him a painting and he shows the faults. You show him a great book, and he shows the faults. He is such a great critical mind! An analyst! A genius!”\nSeventh day he came to the wise man and he said, “Now there is no need to take any advice from you. You are a fool!” The whole town used to believe in that sage, and they all said that “Our genius has said that he is a fool, he must be.”\nPeople always believe in the negative easily because to disprove a no is very difficult – how can you prove? How can you prove that Jesus is son of God? How you will prove? Two thousand years, and Christian theology has been proving without proving it. But within seconds it was proved that he was a sinner, a vagabond, and they killed – within seconds! Somebody said that “I have seen this man coming out of a prostitute’s house” – finished! Nobody bothers whether this man who is saying that “I have seen,” is believable or not – nobody bothers! The negative is always believed easily because it is also helping your ego. The positive is not believed.\nYou can say no whenever there is virtue. But you are not harming the virtuous man: you are harming you. You are self-destructive. You are, in fact, committing suicide slowly – poisoning yourself. When you say that “This man is not virtuous, that man is not virtuous,” what are you, in fact, creating? You are creating a milieu in which you will come to believe that virtue is impossible; and when virtue is impossible, there is no need to attempt. Then you fall down. Then you settle wherever you are. Growth becomes impossible. And you would like to settle, but then you settle in misery because you are miserable.\nYou all have settled completely. This settlement has to be broken; you have to be unsettled. Wherever you are you have to be uprooted and replanted in a higher plane, and that is possible only if you are joyful towards the virtuous.\n... JOY TOWARDS THE VIRTUOUS AND INDIFFERENCE TOWARDS THE EVIL.\nDon’t even condemn evil.\nThe temptation is there; you would like to condemn even virtue. And Patanjali says don’t condemn evil. Why? He knows the inner dynamics of the mind: because if you too much condemn evil, you pay too much attention to evil, and by and by, you become attuned to it. If you say that “This is wrong, that is wrong,” you are paying too much attention to the wrong. You will become addicted with the wrong. If you pay too much attention to anything, you become hypnotized. And whatsoever you are condemning you will commit, because it will become an attraction, a deep-down attraction. Otherwise, why bother? They are sinners, but who are you to bother about them?\nJesus says, “Judge ye not...” That’s what Patanjali means – indifference; don’t judge this way or that – be indifferent. Don’t say yes or no; don’t condemn, don’t appreciate. Simply leave it to the divine; it is none of your business. A man is a thief: it is his business. It is his and God’s. Let them settle themselves; you don’t come in. Who is asking you to come in? Jesus says, “Judge ye not...” Patanjali says, “Be indifferent.”\nOne of the greatest. hypnotists of the world, Emile Coue, discovered a law – law of hypnosis. He called it the Law of Reverse Effect. If you are too much against something, you will become a victim. See a new person learning bicycle on the road. The road is sixty feet wide, and there is a milestone by the side of the road. Even if you are a perfect cyclist and you make the target of the stone that “I will go and crash with the stone,” sometimes you may miss. But never the new learner – never! He never misses the cornerstone. In a subtle way, his cycle moves towards the stone, and sixty feet wide is the road! Even with blindfolded eyes you can move on it – even if there is nobody on the road, it is completely silent, nobody is moving...\nWhat happens to this new learner? A law is working. Emile Coue calls it the Law of the Reverse Effect. Immediately, because he is a learner, he is afraid, so he looks around, where is the fear point – where he can go wrong? The whole road is okay, but this stone, this red stone by the corner, that is the danger: “I may crash with it.” Now there is an affinity created. Now his attention is towards the stone; the whole road is forgotten. And he is a learner! His hands tremble, and he is looking at the stone, and by and by he feels that the cycle is moving. Once he feels the cycle...\nThe cycle has to follow your attention: cycle has no will of its own. It follows you wherever you are going, and you follow your eyes, and eyes follow a subtle hypnosis, an attentiveness. You are looking at the stone, the hands move that way. You become more and more afraid. The more you are afraid, the more caught, because now the stone seems to be an evil force, as if the stone is attracting you. The whole road is forgotten, the cycle is forgotten, the learner is forgotten. Only the stone is there; you are hypnotized. You will go and crash with the stone. Now you have fulfilled your mind; next time you will be more afraid. Now where to break out of it?\nWhen you say that something is wrong, go in the monasteries – the monks condemning sex. Sex has become the milestone. Twenty-four hours they are thinking about it: trying to avoid it is thinking about it. The more you try to avoid it, the more you are hypnotized. That is why in the old scriptures it is said whenever a saint concentrates, beautiful girls from heaven come and try to disturb his mind. Why beautiful girls should be interested? Somebody is sitting under a tree with closed eyes, why beautiful girls will be interested in this man?\nNobody comes from anywhere, but he is so much against sex it becomes a hypnosis. He is so much hypnotized that now dreams become real. He opens the eyes and sees a beautiful naked girl standing there. You need a pornographic book to see a nude woman. If you go to the monastery you will not need a pornographic book: you create your pornography yourself all around. And then the seer, the man who was concentrating, becomes more afraid: he closes his eyes, clenches his fist. Now inside the woman is standing.\nAnd you cannot find such beautiful women on this earth because they are creations of dream – hypnosis byproducts – and the more he becomes afraid, the more they are there. They will rub with his body, they will touch his head, they will cling and embrace him. He is completely mad, but\nthis happens. This is happening to you also. Degrees may differ, but this is what is happening. Whatsoever you are against, you will be joined with it deep down.\nNever be against anything. To be against evil is to fall a victim. Then you are falling in the hands of the evil. Indifference: if you follow indifference, it means it is none of your concern. Somebody is stealing: that is his karma. He will know and he will have to suffer. That is not your business at all: you don’t think about it, don’t pay any attention to it. There is a prostitute: she is selling her body – that is her business. You don’t have condemnation in you, otherwise you will be attracted towards her.\nIt happened – a very old story – that a saint and a prostitute lived together. They were neighbors, and then they died. The saint was very famous. Death came and started trying to take the saint to the hell. And they died on the Fame day, the prostitute also.\nThe saint was surprised because the prostitute was taken on the road towards heaven. So he said, “What is this? There seems some misunderstanding. I am the one who should be led towards heaven. And this is a prostitute!”\nDeath said, ’We know, but now if you want, we can explain you: there is no misunderstanding. There are the orders – that the prostitute has to be brought to heaven and the saint has to be thrown into hell.” The saint said, “But why?” Even the prostitute could not believe. She said, “Something must be wrong. I must be thrown in heaven? And he is a saint – a great saint. We worshipped him. Take him to heaven.”\nDeath said, “No, that’s not possible, because he was a saint just on the surface, and he was thinking continuously of you. And when you will sing in the night, he will come and listen to you. He will stand just near the fence and listen to you. And millions of times he would like to go to see you, love you; millions of times he dreamed of you. He was continuously thinking about you. On the lips was the name of God; in the heart was the image of you.”\nAnd the same from the opposite direction was true with the prostitute. She was selling her body, but always thinking that she would like to have a life like this saint who lives in a temple. “How pure he is!” She dreamt about the saint, the purity, the saintliness, the virtue that she is missing. And when customers would have gone, she will pray to God that “Next time don’t make me a prostitute again. Make me a worshipper; make me a meditator. I would like to serve in the temple.”\nAnd many times she thought to go into the temple, but thinking that she is so much in sin, it was not good to enter the temple: “The place is so holy and I am such a sinner.” And many times she wanted to touch the feet of the saint, but thinking that that will not be good: “I am not worthy enough to touch his feet.” So when the saint will pass, she will just collect the dust on the road from where the saint has passed, and she will worship that dust.\nWhat you are outwardly is not the question. What is your inner hypnosis will decide your future course of life. Be indifferent to evil. Indifference does not mean apathy – remember. These are subtle distinctions. Indifference doesn’t mean apathy It does not mean that close your eyes, because even if you close you have taken a standpoint, attitude. It does not mean don’t bother, because there also is a subtle condemnation. Indifference simply means as if it doesn’t exist, as if it is not there. No attitude indifference means. You pass as if it is not happening.\nUpeksha, the word Patanjali uses, is very beautiful. It is neither apathy nor antagonism nor escape. It is simple indifference without any attitude – remember, without any attitude, because you can be indifferent with an attitude. You can think it is not worth – it is not worthy of me to think about it. No, then you have an attitude, and a subtle condemnation is hidden in it. Indifference means simply, ’Who are you to decide, to judge?” You think about you, ’Who are you? How can you say what is evil and what is good? Who knows?”\nBecause life is such a complexity the evil becomes good, the good becomes evil – they change. Sinners have been known to reach the ultimate; saints have been known to be thrown into hell. So who knows? And who are you? Who is asking you? You take care of yourself. Even if you can do that, enough you have done. You be more mindful and aware; then an indifference comes to you without any attitude.\nIt happened: Vivekananda, before he went to America and became a world-famous figure, stayed in Jaipur Maharaja’s palace. The Maharaja was a lover of Vivekananda and Ramakrishna. As maharajas go, when Vivekananda came to stay in his palace he made a great festival out of it, and he called prostitutes to dance and sing in reception... as maharajas go: they have their own minds. He completely forgot that to receive a sannyasin with the singing of prostitutes and dancing of prostitutes doesn’t suit. But he couldn’t know anything else. He always knew that when you have to receive somebody, drinking, dancing has to be done.\nAnd Vivekananda was still immature; he was not a perfect sannyasin yet. Had he been a perfect sannyasin, then there was indifference – no problem – but he was not indifferent yet. He has not gone that deep into Patanjali even. He was a young man, and a very suppressive one who was suppressing his sex and everything. When he saw the prostitutes, he simply locked his room and would not come out of it.\nThe Maharaja came and he asked his forgiveness. He said, ’We don’t know. We have never received any sannyasin. We always receive kings, so we know the ways. So we are sorry, but now it will be too much insulting, because this is the greatest prostitute in the country – and very costly. And we have paid, and to say her to move and go will be insulting to her, and if you don’t come she will feel very much hurt. So come out.”\nBut Vivekananda was afraid to come out; that’s why I say he was still immature, still not a seasoned sannyasin. Still indifference is not there – a condemnation: “A prostitute?” – he was very angry, and he said, “No” Then the prostitute started singing without him, and she sang a song of a saint. The song is very beautiful. The song says that “I know that I am not worthy of you, but you could have been a little more compassionate. I am dirt on the road; that I know. But you need not be so antagonistic to me. I am nobody – ignorant, a sinner. But you are a saint – why are you afraid of me?”\nIt is said Vivekananda heard from his room. The prostitute was weeping and singing, and he felt – he felt the whole situation of what he is doing. It is immature, childish. Why he is afraid? Fear exists only if you are attracted. You will be afraid of women if you are attracted of women. If you are not attracted, the fear disappears. What is the fear? An indifference comes without any antagonism.\nHe opened the door: he couldn’t contain himself, he was defeated by the prostitute. The prostitute became victorious; he had to come out. He came and he sat, and he wrote in his diary that “A new\nrevelation has been given to me by the divine. I was afraid... must be some lust within me. That’s why I was afraid. But the woman defeated me completely, and I have never seen such a pure soul. The tears were so innocent and the singing and the dancing were so holy that I would have missed. And sitting near her, for the first time I became aware that it is not a question who is there outside; it is a question what is.”\nThat night he wrote in his diary that ’Now I can even sleep with that woman in the bed and there will be no fear.” He transcended. That prostitute helped him to transcend. This is a miracle. Ramakrishna couldn’t help and a prostitute helped him. So nobody knows from where the help will come. Nobody knows what is evil and what is good. Who can decide? Mind is impotent and helpless. So don’t take any attitude: that is the meaning of being indifferent.\nTHE MIND ALSO BECOMES TRANQUIL BY ALTERNATELY EXPELLING AND RETAINING THE BREATH.\nPatanjali gives other alternatives also. If you can do this – being happy with happy people, friendly; compassion with the miserable, joy with the virtuous, indifference with the evil ones – if you can do this, then you enter from the transformation of the mind towards the supermind. If you cannot do – because it is difficult, not easy – then there are other ways. Don’t feel depressed.\nSays Patanjali:\nTHE MIND ALSO BECOMES TRANQUIL BY ALTERNATELY EXPELLING AND RETAINING THE BREATH.\nThen you enter through the physiology. This is entering through the mind – the first: the second is entering through the physiology.\nBreathing and thinking are deeply connected, as if they are two poles of one thing. You also sometimes become aware, if you are a little mindful, that whenever the mind changes, the breathing changes. For example, you are angry: immediately the breathing changes, the rhythm is gone. The breathing has a different quality. It is non-rhythmic.\nWhen you have passion, lust, sex takes over, the breathing changes; it becomes feverish, mad. when you are silent, just not doing anything, just feeling very relaxed, the breathing has a different rhythm. If you watch, ’and Patanjali must have watched very deeply... he says if you watch deeply you can find what type of breathing and its rhythm creates what type of mind. If you feel friendly, the breathing is different. If you feel antagonistic, angry, the breathing is different. So either change the mind and the breathing will change, or you can do the opposite: change the breathing and the mind will change. Change the rhythm of breathing, and the mind will immediately change.\nWhen you feel happy, silent, joyous, remember the rhythm of the breathing. Next time when anger comes, you don’t allow the breathing to change; you retain the rhythm of breathing as if you are happy. Anger is not possible then because the breathing creates the situation. The breathing forces the inner glands in the body which release chemicals in the blood.\nThat’s why you become red when you are angry: certain chemicals have come into the blood, and you become feverish. Your temperature goes high. The body is ready to fight or take flight; the body is in an emergency. Through hammering of the breathing, this change comes.\nDon’t change the breathing. Just retain as if you are silent; just the breathing just has to follow a silent pattern – you will feel it impossible to become angry. When you are feeling very passionate, lust, sex takes over. Just try to be tranquil in the breathing, and you feel sex has disappeared.\nHere he suggests a method:\nTHE MIND ALSO BECOMES TRANQUIL BY ALTERNATELY EXPELLING AND RETAINING THE BREATH.\nYou can do two things: whenever you feel the mind is not tranquil – tense, worried, chattering, anxiety, constantly dreaming – do one thing: first exhale deeply. Always start by exhaling. Exhale deeply: as much as you can, throw the air out. With the throwing of the air the mood will be thrown out, because breathing is everything.\nAnd then expel the breath as far as possible. Take the belly in and retain for few seconds – don’t inhale. Let the air be out, and you don’t inhale for few seconds. Then allow the body to inhale. Inhale deeply – as much as you can. Again stop for few seconds. The same should be the gap as you retain the breath out – if you retain for three seconds, retain the breath in three seconds. Throw it out; retain for three seconds. Take in; retain for three seconds. But it has to be thrown out completely. Exhale totally and inhale totally, and make a rhythm. Retain, in; retain, out. Retain, in; retain, out. Immediately you will feel a change coming into your whole being. The mood is gone. A new climate has entered into you.\nWhat happens? Why is it so? For many reasons: one, when you start creating this rhythm, your mind is completely diverted. You cannot be angry, because a new thing has started, and mind cannot have two things together. Your mind is now filled with exhaling, inhaling, retaining, creating a rhythm. You are completely absorbed in it, the cooperation with anger is broken: one thing.\nThis exhaling, inhaling, cleanses the whole body. When you exhale out and retain for three seconds or five seconds – as much as you want, as much as you can – what happens inside? The whole body throws all that is poisonous into the blood. Air is out and the body gets a gap. In that gap all the poisons are thrown out. They come to the heart, they accumulate there – poisonous gases, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, they all gather together there.\nYou don’t give a chance for them to gather together. You go on breathing in and out. There is no gap, no pause. In that pause, a gap is created, an emptiness. In that emptiness, everything flows and fills it. Then you take a deep inhalation and then you retain. All those poisonous gases become mixed with the breathing; then you again exhale and throw them out. Again pause. Let the poisons gather. And this is a way of throwing things out.\nMind and breath are so much connected – have to be, because breathing is life. A man can be without mind, but cannot be without breathing. Breathing is deeper than mind. Your brain can be operated completely; you will be alive if you can breathe. If the breathing continues, you will be alive. The brain can be taken out completely. You will vegetate, but you will be alive. You will not be able to open the eyes and talk or do anything, but on the bed you can be alive, vegetating for many years. But mind cannot If the breathing stops, mind disappears.\nYoga found this basic thing – that breathing is deeper than thinking. If you change breathing, you change thinking. And once you know the key, that breathing has the key, you can create any climate that you want: it is up to you. The way you breathe it depends on it. Just you do one thing: for seven days, you just make a notebook of the different types of breathing that happen with different moods. You are angry: take a notebook and just count breathing – how much you inhale and how much you exhale. Five counts you inhale, three counts you exhale – note it down.\nSometime you are feeling very, very beautiful – note it down, what is the proportion of inhalation and exhalation, what is the length, is there any pause – note it down. And for seven days just make a diary to feel your own breathing, how it is connected with your moods. Then you can sort it out. Then whenever you want to drop a mood, just use the opposite pattern. Or, if you want to bring a mood, then use the pattern.\nActors, knowingly, unknowingly, come to know it because sometimes they have to be angry without being angry. So what they will do? They will have to create the breathing pattern. They may not be aware, but they will start breathing as if they are angry, and soon the blood rushes in and poisons are released. And without being angry their eyes are red, and they are in a subtle anger state without being angry. They have to make love without being in love; they have to show love without being in love. How they do it? They know a certain secret of yoga.\nThat’s why I always say a yogi can become the most perfect actor. He isl His stage is vast, that’s all. He is acting – not acting on the stage, but on the stage of the world. He is an actor; he is not a doer. And the difference is that he is taking part in a great drama and he can remain a witness to it and he can remain aloof and detached.\nWHEN MEDITATION PRODUCES EXTRAORDINARY SENSE PERCEPTIONS, THE MIND GAINS CONFIDENCE AND THIS HELPS PERSEVERANCE.\nIf you work out your breathing pattern, and you find the secret keys how to change the climate of the mind how to change the moods... And if you work from both the poles, that will be better. And try to be friendly towards happy, indifferent towards the evil, and continue the change and transformation of your breathing patterns also. Then there will be extraordinary sense perceptions.\nIf you have taken LSD, marijuana, hashish, then you know extraordinary sense perceptions happen. You look ordinary things, and they become extraordinary. Aldous Huxley remembers that when he took for the first time LSD he was sitting before an ordinary chair, and when he became more and more deep with the drug, when he was on, the chair immediately started changing color. Radiant it became: an ordinary chair – he had never paid any attention to it – became so beautiful, many colors coming out of it, as if it is made of diamonds. Such beautiful shapes and nuances that he couldn’t believe his eyes, what is happening. Later on he remembered this must have happened to Van Gogh, because he has painted a chair almost exactly the same.\nA poet need not take LSD. He has an inbuilt system of throwing LSD in the body. That is the difference between a poet and an ordinary man. That’s why they say a poet is born, not made: because he has an extra-ordinary body structure. The chemicals in his body have a different quantity and quality to them. That’s why where you don’t see anything he sees miracles. You see an ordinary tree, and he sees something unbelievable. You see ordinary clouds: a poet, if he is really a poet, never sees anything ordinary; everything is extra-ordinarily beautiful.\nThe same happens to a yOgi: because when you change your breathing and your attitudes, your body chemistry changes its pattern; you are going through a chemical transformation, and then your eyes become clear, a new perceptivity happens. The old same tree becomes absolutely new. You never knew the shade of its green: it becomes radiant. The whole world all around you takes a new shape. It is a paradise now – not the ordinary old rotten earth.\nPeople around you are no more the same. Your ordinary wife becomes a most beautiful woman. Everything changes with your clarity of perception. When your eyes change, everything changes. Says Patanjali,\nWHEN MEDITATION PRODUCES EXTRAORDINARY SENSE PERCEPTIONS, THE MIND GAINS CONFIDENCE AND THAT HELPS PERSEVERANCE.\nThen you become confident that you are on the right path. The world is becoming more and more beautiful the ugliness is disappearing. The world is becoming more and more a harmony; the discord is disappearing. The world iS becoming more and more home, you are feeling more and more at ease in it. It is friendly. It is a love affair with you and the universe. You become more confident, and more perseverance comes to your effort.\nALSO, MEDITATE ON THE INNER LIGHT WHICH IS SERENE, BEYOND ALL SORROW.\nThis can be done only when you have attained a certain quality Of perceptivity. Then you can close the eyes and you can find a flame – a beautiful flame near the heart, a blue light. But right now you cannot see it. It is there, it has been always there. When you die, that blue light goes out of your body. But you cannot see it because when you were alive you couldn’t see it.\nAnd others will also be not able to see it, that something is going out; but Kirlian in Soviet Russia, he has taken photographs with very sensitive films. When a person dies, something happens around. Some body-energy, some light-like thing, leaves, goes and disappears into the cosmos. That light is always there: that is your center of being. It is near the heart – with a blue flame.\nWhen you have some perception, you can see the beautiful world all around you – when your eyes are clear. You close them and you move nearer the heart; you try to find what is there. First you will feel darkness. It is just like as you come from the outside on a hot sunny day inside the room, and you feel everything is dark. But wait Let the eyes be attuned with the darkness, and soon you start seeing things in the house.\nYou have been outside for millions of lives. When for the first time you come in, nothing is there except darkness, emptiness. But wait It will take few days – even few months, but just wait, close the eyes and look down in the heart. Suddenly, one day it happens: you see a light, a flame. Then concentrate on that flame.\nNothing is more blissful than that. Nothing is more dancing, singing, musical, harmonious like that inner blue light within your heart. And the more you concentrate, the more you become tranquil, silent, calm, collected. then there is no darkness for you. When your heart is filled with light, the whole universe is filled with light.\nALSO, MEDITATE ON THE INNER LIGHT WHICH IS SERENE AND BEYOND ALL SORROW.\nALSO, MEDITATE ON ONE WHO HAS ATTAINED DESIRELESSNESS.\nThat tool All alternatives Patanjali is giving you A veetaraga, one who has gone beyond all desires – also meditate on him. Mahavira, Buddha, Patanjali – your own – Zarathustra, Mohammed, Christ or anybody you feel an affinity and love... Meditate on one who has gone beyond desires. Meditate on your Master, on your guru, who has gone beyond desires. How it will help? It helps, because when you meditate on someone who has gone beyond desires he becomes a magnetic force in you. You allow him to enter within you; he pulls you out of yourself. This becomes your availability to him.\nIf you meditate on someone who has gone beyond desires, you will become like him sooner or later, because meditation makes you like the object of meditation itself. If you meditate on money, you will become just like money. Go and look at a miser; he has no more a soul. He has only a bank balance; he has nothing inside. If you listen, you will just hear notes, rupees: you will not find any heart there. Whatsoever you pay your attention, you become like it. So be aware. Don’t pay attention to something you would not like to become. Only pay attention to something you would like to become, because this is the beginning. The seed is sown with the attention, and soon it will become a tree.\nYou sow the seeds of hell, and when it becomes a tree then you say, “Why I am so miserable?n You always pay attention to the wrong; you always look to that which is negative. You always pay attention to the fault; then you become faulty.\nDon’t pay attention to the fault. Pay attention to the beautiful. Why count the thorns? Why not see the flower? Why count the nights? Why not count the days? If you count the nights, then there are two nights and only one day between the two. If you count the days, then there are two days and only one night in between. And it makes a lot of difference. Look at the light side if you want to become light; look at the dark if you want to become dark.\nSays Patanjali:\nALSO, MEDITATE ON ONE WHO HAS ATTAINED DESIRELESSNESS.\nSeek a Master; surrender to a Master. Be attentive to him. Listen, watch, eat and drink him. Let him enter you; allow your heart to be filled with him. Soon you will be on a journey, because the object of attention ultimately becomes the goal of your life. And attention is a secret relationship. Through attention you become the object of your attention.\nKrishnamurti goes on saying, “The observer becomes the observed.” He is right: whatsoever you observe, you will become. So be alert Beware Don’t observe something which you would not like to become, because that is your goal; you are sowing the seeds.\nLive near a veetaraga – a man who is beyond desires. Live near a man who has no more to fulfill here, who is fulfilled. His very fulfilledness will overflood you, and he will become a catalyst.\nHe will not do anything, because a man who is beyond desires cannot do anything. Even he cannot help you because help is also a desire. Much help comes through him, but he doesn’t help you. He becomes a catalyst without doing anything, if you allow him; he drops into your heart and his very presence crystallizes you.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"10201","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/yoga_the_alpha_and_the_omega__vol_2/part9/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/yoga_the_alpha_and_the_omega__vol_2/>Yoga, The Alpha and the Omega - Vol 2</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">9 Cultivating Right Attitudes</h1><div class=post-meta>48 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;10201 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Yoga_The_Alpha_and_the_Omega__Vol_2/part9.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part8>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

TOWARDS THE HAPPY, COMPASSION TOWARDS THE MISERABLE, JOY TOWARDS THE
VIRTUOUS AND INDIFFERENCE TOWARDS THE EVIL.</p><p><br></p><p>THE MIND ALSO BECOMES TRANQUIL BY ALTERNATELY EXPELLING AND RETAINING
THE BREATH.</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN MEDITATION PRODUCES EXTRAORDINARY SENSE PERCEPTIONS, THE MIND
GAINS CONFIDENCE AND THIS HELPS PERSEVERANCE.</p><p><br></p><p>ALSO, MEDITATE ON THE INNER LIGHT WHICH IS SERENE AND BEYOND ALL
SORROW. ALSO MEDITATE ON ONE WHO HAS ATTAINED DESIRELESSNESS.</p><p>THE MIND BECOMES TRANQUIL BY CULTIVATING ATTITUDES OF FRIENDLINESS
TOWARDS THE HAPPY, COMPASSION TOWARDS THE MISERABLE, JOY TOWARDS THE
VIRTUOUS AND INDIFFERENCE TOWARDS THE EVIL.</p><p><br></p><p>MANY THINGS HAVE TO be understood before you can understand this
sutra. First, the natural attitudes: whenever you see somebody happy,
you feel jealous – not happy, never happy. You feel miserable. That’s
the natural attitude, the attitude that you have already got. And
Patanjali says the mind becomes tranquil by cultivating attitudes of
friendliness towards the happy – very difficult. To be friendly with
someone who is happy is one of the most difficult things in life.</p><p>Ordinarily, you think it is very easy. It is not! Just the opposite
is the case. You feel jealous, you feel miserable. You may show
happiness, but that’s just a facade, a show, a mask. And how you can be
happy? And how you can be tranquil, silent, if you have such an
attitude?</p><p><br></p><p>Because the whole life is celebrating, millions of happinesses
happening all over the universe, but if you have an attitude of
jealousy, you will be miserable, you will be in a constant hell. And you
will be in a hell precisely because all over there is heaven. You will
create a hell for you – a private hell – because whole existence is
celebrating.</p><p><br></p><p>If somebody is happy, what comes first to your mind? – as if that
happiness has been taken from you, as if he has won and you are
defeated, as if he has cheated you... Happiness is not a competition, so
don’t be worried. If somebody is happy, it does not mean that you cannot
be happy, that he has taken happiness – now how you can be happy.
Happiness is not somewhere existing, which can be exhausted by happy
people.</p><p><br></p><p>Why you feel jealous? If somebody is rich, maybe it is difficult for
you to be rich because riches exist in a quantity. If somebody is
powerful in a material way, it may be difficult for you to be powerful
because power is a competition. But happiness is not a competition.
Happiness exists in infinite quantity. Nobody has ever been able to
exhaust it; there is no competition at all. If somebody is happy, why
you feel jealous? And with jealousy enters hell in you.</p><p><br></p><p>Says Patanjali, when somebody is happy, feel happy, feel friendly.
Then you also open a door towards happiness. In a subtle way, if you can
feel friendly with someone who is happy, you immediately start sharing
his happiness; it has become yours also – immediately ! And happiness is
not someTHING; it is not material. It is not something that somebody can
cling to. You can share it. When a flower blooms, you can share it; when
a bird sings, you can share it; when somebody is happy, you can share
it. And the beauty is that it does not depend on his sharing. It depends
on your partaking.</p><p><br></p><p>If it depended on his sharing, whether he shares or not, then it was
totally a different thing. He may not like to share. But this is not a
question at all, it does not depend on his sharing. When the sun rises
in the morning you can be happy, and the sun cannot do anything about
it. It cannot prevent you being happy. Somebody is happy: you can be
friendly. It is totally your own attitude, and he cannot prevent you by
sharing. Immediately you open a door, and his happiness flows towards
you also.</p><p><br></p><p>This is the secret of creating a heaven all around you, and only
within heaven can you be tranquil. How can you be tranquil in hell-fire?
And nobody is creating it: you create it. So the basic thing to be
understood is that whenever there is misery, hell, you are the cause of
it. Never throw the responsibility on anybody else because that throwing
of responsibility is escaping from the basic truth.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are miserable, only you – absolutely only you – are
responsible. Look within and find the cause of it. And nobody wants to
be miserable. If you can find the cause within you, you can throw it
out. Nobody is standing in your way to prevent you. There is not a
single obstacle to be happy.</p><p><br></p><p>But by being friendly towards happy people, you become attuned to
happiness. They are flowering; you become friendly. They may not be
friendly; that is none of your concern. They may not even</p><p>know you – that doesn’t matter. But wherever there is a blooming,
wherever there is bliss, wherever somebody is flower-ing, wherever
somebody is dancing and is happy and is smiling, wherever there is
celebration, you become friendly, you partake of it. It starts flowing
within you, and nobody can prevent it. And when there is happiness all
around you, you feel tranquil.</p><p><br></p><p>THE MIND BECOMES TRANQUIL BY CULTIVATING ATTITUDES OF FRIENDLINESS
TOWARDS THE HAPPY...</p><p><br></p><p>With the happy, you feel jealous – in a subtle competition. With
happy people, you feel yourself inferior. You always choose people
around you who are unhappy. You become friendly with unhappy people
because with unhappy people you feel superior. You always seek somebody
who is below you. You are always afraid of the higher; you always seek
the lower, and the more you seek the lower, the lower you fall. Then
even more lower people are needed.</p><p><br></p><p>Seek the company of those who are higher than you – higher in wisdom,
higher in happiness, higher in tranquility, calmness, quiet,
collectedness: always seek the company of the higher because that is the
way how you become higher, how you transcend the valleys and reach to
the peaks. That becomes a ladder. Always seek the company of the higher,
the beautiful, the happy – you will become more beautiful, you will
become more happy.</p><p><br></p><p>And once the secret is known, once you know how one becomes more
happy, how with others’ happiness you create a situation for yourself
also to be happy, then there is no barrier; then you can go as far as
you like. You can become a god where no unhappiness exists.</p><p><br></p><p>Who is a god? A god is one who has learned the secret to be happy
with the whole universe, with every flower and with every river and with
every rock and every star, who has become one with this continuous
eternal celebration, who celebrates, who doesn’t bother whose
celebration is this. Wherever there is a celebration, he participates.
This art of participating in happiness is one of the foundations if you
want to be happy. It has to be followed.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the opposite you have been doing: if somebody is happy,
immediately you are shocked. How is it possible? How come you are not
happy and he has become happy? There is injustice. This whole world is
cheating you and there is no God. If God is, how come you are not happy
and others are becoming happy? And these people who are happy, they are
the exploiters, they are tricky, cunning. They live on your blood. They
are sucking others’ happiness.</p><p><br></p><p>Nobody is sucking anybody’s happiness. Happiness is such a
phenomenon, there is no need to suck it. It is an inner flowering; it
doesn’t come from the outside. Just by being happy with happy people you
create the situation in Which your own inner flower starts blooming:</p><p><br></p><p>THE MIND BECOMES TRANQUIL BY CULTIVATING ATTITUDES OF
FRIENDLINESS...</p><p><br></p><p>You create the attitude of enmity. You can feel friendly with a sad
person, and you think it is very virtuous. You can feel friendly with
someone who is depressed, in misery, and you think it is something
religious, something moral you are doing, but what are you doing, you
don’t know.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever you feel friendly with someone who is sad, depressed,
unhappy, miserable, you create misery for you. It looks very
irreligious, Patanjali’s attitude. It is not, because when you will</p><p>understand his whole standpoint you will see what he means. He is
very scientific. He is not a sentimental person, and sentimentality
won’t help you.</p><p><br></p><p>One has to be very very clear:</p><p><br></p><p>... COMPASSION TOWARDS THE MISERABLE...</p><p><br></p><p>Not friendliness – compassion. Compassion is a different quality;
friendliness is different. Friendliness means you are creating a
situation in which you would like to be the same as the other person is,
you would like to be the same as your friend. Compassion means that
someone has fallen from his state. You would like to help him, but you
would not like to be like him. You would like to give him a hand; you
would like to bring him up, cheer him up. You would like to help him in
every way, but you would not like to be like him because that is not a
help.</p><p><br></p><p>Somebody is crying and weeping, and you sit by the side and you start
crying and weeping: are you helping him? In what way? Somebody is
miserable and you become miserable; are you helping him? You may be
doubling his misery. He was alone miserable; now there are two persons
miserable. But in showing sympathy to the miserable you are again
playing a trick. Deep down, when you show sympathy to the miserable –
and remember, sympathy is not compassion; sympathy is friendliness. When
you show sympathy and friendliness to a depressed, sad, miserable
person, deep down you are feeling happy. Always there is an undercurrent
of happiness. It has to be so because it is a simple arithmetic: when
somebody is happy, you feel miserable, then how it is possible when
somebody is miserable you can feel unhappy? Somebody is happy you feel
miserable; then somebody is unhappy, deep down you feel very happy.</p><p><br></p><p>But you don’t show it. Or;, if you are observed acutely even you show
it – even in your sympathy there is a subtle current of happiness. You
feel good; you feel cheered up really, that it is not you who is
unhappy, and you are in a position to show sympathy – and you are
higher, superior.</p><p><br></p><p>People always feel good when they can show sympathy to others; they
are always cheered. Deep down they feel that they are not so miserable,
thank God When somebody dies, immediately an undercurrent in you comes
that you are still alive, thank God. And you can show sympathy and it
costs nothing. Showing sympathy costs nothing, but compassion is a
different thing. Compassion means you would like to kelp the other
person; you would like to do whatsoever can be done; you would like to
help him to come out of his misery. You are not happy about it, but you
are not miserable also.</p><p><br></p><p>And just between the two exists compassion: Buddha is in compassion.
He will not feel miserable with you because that is not going to help
anybody, and he will not feel happy because there is no point in feeling
happy. How can you feel happy when somebody is miserable? But he cannot
feel unhappy also because that is not going to help. He will feel
compassion. Compassion exists just in between these two. Compassion
means he would like to help you to come out of it. He is for you,
compassion means, but against your misery; he loves you, but not your
misery. He would like to bring you up, but not your misery with you.</p><p><br></p><p>When you are sympathetic you start loving the misery, not the man who
is miserable. And if suddenly the man is cheered up and says, “Don’t
bother,” you will feel shocked, because he never gave you a chance to be
sympathetic and show him that how higher, superior and happy a being you
are.</p><p>Don’t be miserable with somebody who is miserable. Help him to come
out of it. Never make misery an object of love; don’t give any affection
to misery, because if you give affection and you make it an object of
love, you are opening a door for it. Sooner or later you will become
miserable. Remain aloof. Compassion means remain aloof Extend your hand,
remain aloof, help – don’t feel miserable, don’t feel happy, because
both are the same. When you feel miserable on the surface with
somebody’s misery, deep down runs the current of being happy. Both have
to be dropped. Compassion will bring you tranquility of the mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Many people come to me; they are social reformers, revolutionaries,
politicians, utopians, and they say, “How you can teach people
meditation and silence when there is so much misery in the world?” They
tell me, “This is selfish.” They would like me to teach people to be
miserable with others who are miserable. They don’t know what they are
saying but they feel very good – doing social work, social service, they
feel very good. And if suddenly the world becomes a heaven, and God
says, “Now everything will be okay,” you will find the social reformers
and revolutionaries in absolute misery, because they will have nothing
to do.</p><p><br></p><p>Khalil Gibran has written a small parable. In a city, in a big city,
there was a dog who was a preacher and a missionary, and he preached to
other dogs that “Stop barking. We waste almost ninety-nine percent of
our energy in barking unnecessarily. That’s why we have not been
evolving. Stop barking unnecessarily.”</p><p><br></p><p>But it is difficult for dogs to stop barking. That is an in-built
process. Really they feel happy only when they bark. It is a catharsis.
They feel silent when they have barked. So, they listened to the leader
– the revolutionary, the utopian, who was thinking of kingdom of gods,
kingdom of dogs, somewhere in the coming future, where every dog is
reformed and has become religious – no barking, no fighting, everything
is silent... a pacifist, must have been – that missionary.</p><p><br></p><p>But dogs are dogs. They will listen to him and then they will say,
“You are a great man, and whatsoever you say is true. But we are
helpless, poor dogs. We don’t understand such big things.” So all the
dogs felt guilty because they couldn’t stop. And they believed in the
message of the leader, and he was right: rationally, they could follow.
But what to do with the bodies? The bodies are irrational. Whenever
there will be a chance – a sannyasin walking – they will bark: a
policeman, a postman... because they are against uniforms.</p><p><br></p><p>It was almost impossible for them, and they had settled it that “That
dog is a great man, and we cannot follow. He is like an avatar –
something from the other shore. So we will worship him, but how can we
follow him?n And that leader was always true to his word: he never
barked. But one day everything failed. One night, dark night, the dogs
decided that,”This great leader is always trying to convert us, and we
never listen to him. At least once a year, on the birthday of the
leader, we should keep complete fast: no barking – absolute silence – no
matter how difficult. At least once a year we can do that,” they
decided.</p><p><br></p><p>And on that night not a single dog barked. The leader went from this
corner to that, this street to that, to watch, because wherever dogs
will be barking, he will preach. He started feeling very miserable
because nobody is barking; the whole night completely silent, as if no
dog exists... He went many places, watched, and by the midnight it was
so impossible for him that he moved in a dark corner and barked!</p><p>The moment the other dogs heard that one has broken, they said, “Now
there is no problem.” They didn’t know that the leader has done it. They
thought one of them has broken the vow. But now it was impossible for
them to contain; the whole city barked. The leader came out and he
started preaching!</p><p><br></p><p>This will be the condition of your social revolution – aries,
reformers, Gandhians, Marxists and others – all brands. They will be in
such a difficulty if the world is really changed. If the world fulfills
really the utopia of their minds and imaginations, they will commit
suicide or they will go mad. Or they will start preaching just opposite,
just the contradictory, just the opposite whatsoever they are preaching
now.</p><p><br></p><p>They come to me and they say, “How you can tell people to be silent
when the world is in such a misery?” They think first the misery has to
be removed, then people will be silent? No, if people are silent misery
can be removed, because only silence can remove the misery. Misery is an
attitude. It is less concerned with material conditions, more concerned
with the inner mind, the inner consciousness. Even a poor man can be
happy, and once he is happy many things start falling in line.</p><p><br></p><p>Soon he may not be a poor man, because how can you be poor when you
are happy? When you are happy, the whole world participates with you.
When you are unhappy, everything goes wrong. You create all around a
situation which helps your unhappiness to be there. This is the dynamics
of the mind. It is a self-defeating system. You feel miserable, then
more misery attracts towards you. When more misery attracts you say,
“How I can be silent? So much misery there.” Then even more misery is
attracted toward you. Then you say, “It is impossible now. And those who
say they are happy must be telling lies: these Buddhas, Krishnas, they
must be telling lies. These Patanjalis, they must be liars, because it
is possible, so much misery?”</p><p><br></p><p>Then you are in a self-defeating system. You attract, and not only
you attract for yourself: when one person is miserable, he helps others
also to be miserable, because they are also fools like you. Seeing you
in misery, they sympathize. When they sympathize, they become
vulnerable. So it is just like that: one ill person infects the whole
community.</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla Nasruddin’s doctor sent him a bill. It was too much. His child
was ill: Nasruddin’s small son was ill. He phoned to the doctor that
“This is too much.” The doctor said, “But I had to come nine times to
see your son, so that has to be accounted for.” Nasruddin said, “And
don’t forget that my son infected the whole village, and you have been
earning a lot. In fact you should pay me something.”</p><p><br></p><p>When one person is miserable, he infects. Misery is infectious just
as happiness is infectious. Ar;d if you are vulnerable towards misery –
as you are because you are always seeking unknowingly – your mind seeks
misery, because with misery you feel sympathy; with happiness you feel
jealous.</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla Nasruddin’s wife told me once that “If you are going to New
Delhi – the winter is coming – you bring me a drop-dead coat.” I was
surprised. I couldn’t follow what she means. I told her anyway, “I don’t
know much about coats, but I have never heard. What is a drop-dead
coat?” She said, “You never heard?” and started laughing and said, “A
drop-dead coat is a coat, when you put it on, neighbors drop dead!”</p><p>Unless others drop dead, you don’t feel alive. Unless others are in
misery, you don’t feel happy. But how can you feel happy when others are
unhappy, and how can you feel alive really when others are dead? We
exist together. And sometimes you may be the cause of many people’s
misery. Then you are earning a karma. You may not have directly hit
them; you may not have been violent to them. Subtle is the law You need
not be a murderer, but if simply you infect people by your misery, you
are participating in it; you are creating misery. And you are
responsible for it, and you will have to pay for it. Very subtle is the
mechanism!.</p><p><br></p><p>Just two, three days before it happened a sannyasin attacked Laxmi.
You may not have observed that you all are responsible for it, because
many of you have been feeling antagonism towards Laxmi. That sannyasin
is just a victim, just the weakest link among you. He has expressed your
antagonism, that’s all, and he was the weakest; he became the victim,
and now you will feel that he is responsible. That’s not true. You
participated. Subtle is the law!</p><p><br></p><p>How you participated? Deep down, whenever somebody managing – and
Laxmi is managing things around here... There are many situations in
which you will feel antagonistic, in which she will have to say no to
you, in which you will feel hurt – it cannot be avoided – in which you
feel that enough attention is not being paid to you, in which you feel
that you are treated as if you are nobody. Your ego feels hurt and you
feel antagonism.</p><p><br></p><p>If many people feel antagonism towards a person, then the weakest
amongst them will become the victim; he will do something. He was the
craziest amongst you, that’s right. But he alone is not responsible. If
you have ever felt antagonism towards Laxmi, that is part and you have
earned a karma, and unless you become so subtly aware you cannot become
enlightened. Things are very complicated.</p><p><br></p><p>Now in the West also, psychoanalysts have found that the whole family
is responsible if one person goes mad – whole family! Now they think
that the family has to be treated, not one person, because when one
person goes mad that only shows that the whole family has inner
tensions. This is the weakest of them all, so immediately he shows the
whole thing, he becomes the expression of the whole family, and if you
treat him it won’t help. In the hospital he may be okay: back home he
will fall ill again because the whole family has inner tensions and this
is the weakest.</p><p><br></p><p>Children suffer too much because of parents. They are fighting; they
are always creating anxiety and tension around the house. The whole
house exists not as a peaceful community, but as an inner war and
conflict. The child is vulnerable more; the child starts behaving in
eccentric ways – now you have an excuse that you are tense and worried
because of the child. And now the father and mother both can be
concerned with the child; they will take him to the psychoanalyst and
the doctor, and they can forget their own conflict.</p><p><br></p><p>And this child becomes a cementing force, if he is ill; then they
have to pay more attention to him. And now they have an excuse why they
are worried and tense and in anguish – because the child is ill – and
they don’t know just the reverse is the case... BECAUSE they are
worried, tense in conflict. The child is innocent, tender; he can be
affected immediately, he has no protection around him yet. And if the
child becomes really healthy, the parents will be in more difficulty –
because then there is no excuse.</p><p>This is a community; you live here as a family. Many tensions are
bound to be there, be aware. Be alert about those tensions because your
tensions can create a force. They can become accumulative, and suddenly
somebody who is weak, vulnerable, simple, may become the shelter of the
accumulated force, and then he reacts in a way. Then you all can throw
the responsibility on him. But that is not true if you ever have felt
any antagonism, you are part of it. And the same is true in the greater
world also.</p><p><br></p><p>When Godase murdered Gandhi, I never said that Godase is responsible.
He was the weakest link; that is true. But the whole Hindu mind was
responsible, deep currents of Hindu antagonism against Gandhi. The
feeling that he is for Moslems, Mohammedans, was accumulating. This is
an actual phenomenon: antagonism becomes accumulated. Just like a cloud,
it hovers, and then somewhere a weak heart, a very unprotected man,
becomes the victim. The cloud gets roots into him and then the
explosion. And then everybody is freed: Godase is responsible –
murdering Gandhi – so you can kill Godase and be finished. Then the
whole country moves in the same way, and the Hindu mind remains the
same: no change. Subtle is the law!</p><p><br></p><p>Always find the dynamics of mind. Only then you will be transformed;
otherwise not.</p><p><br></p><p>THE MIND BECOMES TRANQUIL BY CULTIVATING ATTITUDES OF FRIENDLINESS
TOWARDS THE HAPPY, COMPASSION TOWARDS THE MISERABLE, JOY TOWARDS THE
VIRTUOUS...</p><p><br></p><p>Look! Patanjali is making steps – and beautiful and very subtle, but
exactly scientific.</p><p><br></p><p>... JOY TOWARDS THE VIRTUOUS, AND INDIFFERENCE TOWARDS THE EVIL.</p><p><br></p><p>When you feel somebody is a virtuous man, joy, the ordinary attitude
is that he must be deceiving. How anybody can be more virtuous than you?
Hence so much criticism goes on.</p><p><br></p><p>Whenever there is somebody who is virtuous, you immediately start
criticizing, you start finding faults with him. Somehow or other you
have to bring him down. He cannot be virtuous. You cannot believe this.
Patanjali says joy, because if you criticize a virtuous man, deep down
you are criticizing virtue. If you criticize a virtuous man, you are
coming to a point to believe that virtue is impossible in this world.
Then you will feel at ease. Then you can move on your evil ways easily
because, “Nobody is virtuous; everybody is just like me – even worse
than me.” That’s why so much condemnation goes on – criticism,
condemnation.</p><p><br></p><p>If somebody says, “That person is a very beautiful person,” you
immediately find something to criticize. You cannot tolerate – because
if somebody is virtuous and you are not, your ego is shattered, and then
you start feeling that “I have to change myself,” which is an arduous
effort. The simple is to condemn; the simple is to criticize; the simple
is to say, “No! Prove! What are you saying? First, prove how he is
virtuous!” And it is difficult to prove virtue; it is very easy to
unprove anything. It is very difficult to prove!</p><p><br></p><p>One of the greatest Russian storytellers is Turgenev. He has written
a story. The story is that in a small village a man was thought to be
stupid, and he was. And the whole town laughed at him. He was just like
a fool, and everybody in the town enjoyed his foolishness. But he was
tired of his foolishness, so he asked a wise man, “What to do?”</p><p>The wise man said, “Nothing! Simply, whenever somebody is praising
somebody, you condemn. Somebody is saying that ‘That man is a saint,’
immediately say, ‘No! I know well he is a sinner!’ Somebody says, ‘This
book is very great,’ immediately say, ‘I have read it and studied it.’
Don’t bother whether you have read it or not; simply say, ‘This is
rubbish.’ If somebody is saying, ‘This painting is one of the greatest
works of art,’ simply say, ‘But what it is? – just a canvas and colors.
A child can do it!’ Criticize, say no, ask for proofs, and after seven
days come to me.”</p><p><br></p><p>Within seven days the town started feeling that this man is a genius:
“We never knew about his talents, and he is a genius about everything.
You show him a painting and he shows the faults. You show him a great
book, and he shows the faults. He is such a great critical mind! An
analyst! A genius!”</p><p><br></p><p>Seventh day he came to the wise man and he said, “Now there is no
need to take any advice from you. You are a fool!” The whole town used
to believe in that sage, and they all said that “Our genius has said
that he is a fool, he must be.”</p><p><br></p><p>People always believe in the negative easily because to disprove a no
is very difficult – how can you prove? How can you prove that Jesus is
son of God? How you will prove? Two thousand years, and Christian
theology has been proving without proving it. But within seconds it was
proved that he was a sinner, a vagabond, and they killed – within
seconds! Somebody said that “I have seen this man coming out of a
prostitute’s house” – finished! Nobody bothers whether this man who is
saying that “I have seen,” is believable or not – nobody bothers! The
negative is always believed easily because it is also helping your ego.
The positive is not believed.</p><p><br></p><p>You can say no whenever there is virtue. But you are not harming the
virtuous man: you are harming you. You are self-destructive. You are, in
fact, committing suicide slowly – poisoning yourself. When you say that
“This man is not virtuous, that man is not virtuous,” what are you, in
fact, creating? You are creating a milieu in which you will come to
believe that virtue is impossible; and when virtue is impossible, there
is no need to attempt. Then you fall down. Then you settle wherever you
are. Growth becomes impossible. And you would like to settle, but then
you settle in misery because you are miserable.</p><p><br></p><p>You all have settled completely. This settlement has to be broken;
you have to be unsettled. Wherever you are you have to be uprooted and
replanted in a higher plane, and that is possible only if you are joyful
towards the virtuous.</p><p><br></p><p>... JOY TOWARDS THE VIRTUOUS AND INDIFFERENCE TOWARDS THE EVIL.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t even condemn evil.</p><p><br></p><p>The temptation is there; you would like to condemn even virtue. And
Patanjali says don’t condemn evil. Why? He knows the inner dynamics of
the mind: because if you too much condemn evil, you pay too much
attention to evil, and by and by, you become attuned to it. If you say
that “This is wrong, that is wrong,” you are paying too much attention
to the wrong. You will become addicted with the wrong. If you pay too
much attention to anything, you become hypnotized. And whatsoever you
are condemning you will commit, because it will become an attraction, a
deep-down attraction. Otherwise, why bother? They are sinners, but who
are you to bother about them?</p><p>Jesus says, “Judge ye not...” That’s what Patanjali means –
indifference; don’t judge this way or that – be indifferent. Don’t say
yes or no; don’t condemn, don’t appreciate. Simply leave it to the
divine; it is none of your business. A man is a thief: it is his
business. It is his and God’s. Let them settle themselves; you don’t
come in. Who is asking you to come in? Jesus says, “Judge ye not...”
Patanjali says, “Be indifferent.”</p><p><br></p><p>One of the greatest. hypnotists of the world, Emile Coue, discovered
a law – law of hypnosis. He called it the Law of Reverse Effect. If you
are too much against something, you will become a victim. See a new
person learning bicycle on the road. The road is sixty feet wide, and
there is a milestone by the side of the road. Even if you are a perfect
cyclist and you make the target of the stone that “I will go and crash
with the stone,” sometimes you may miss. But never the new learner –
never! He never misses the cornerstone. In a subtle way, his cycle moves
towards the stone, and sixty feet wide is the road! Even with
blindfolded eyes you can move on it – even if there is nobody on the
road, it is completely silent, nobody is moving...</p><p><br></p><p>What happens to this new learner? A law is working. Emile Coue calls
it the Law of the Reverse Effect. Immediately, because he is a learner,
he is afraid, so he looks around, where is the fear point – where he can
go wrong? The whole road is okay, but this stone, this red stone by the
corner, that is the danger: “I may crash with it.” Now there is an
affinity created. Now his attention is towards the stone; the whole road
is forgotten. And he is a learner! His hands tremble, and he is looking
at the stone, and by and by he feels that the cycle is moving. Once he
feels the cycle...</p><p><br></p><p>The cycle has to follow your attention: cycle has no will of its own.
It follows you wherever you are going, and you follow your eyes, and
eyes follow a subtle hypnosis, an attentiveness. You are looking at the
stone, the hands move that way. You become more and more afraid. The
more you are afraid, the more caught, because now the stone seems to be
an evil force, as if the stone is attracting you. The whole road is
forgotten, the cycle is forgotten, the learner is forgotten. Only the
stone is there; you are hypnotized. You will go and crash with the
stone. Now you have fulfilled your mind; next time you will be more
afraid. Now where to break out of it?</p><p><br></p><p>When you say that something is wrong, go in the monasteries – the
monks condemning sex. Sex has become the milestone. Twenty-four hours
they are thinking about it: trying to avoid it is thinking about it. The
more you try to avoid it, the more you are hypnotized. That is why in
the old scriptures it is said whenever a saint concentrates, beautiful
girls from heaven come and try to disturb his mind. Why beautiful girls
should be interested? Somebody is sitting under a tree with closed eyes,
why beautiful girls will be interested in this man?</p><p><br></p><p>Nobody comes from anywhere, but he is so much against sex it becomes
a hypnosis. He is so much hypnotized that now dreams become real. He
opens the eyes and sees a beautiful naked girl standing there. You need
a pornographic book to see a nude woman. If you go to the monastery you
will not need a pornographic book: you create your pornography yourself
all around. And then the seer, the man who was concentrating, becomes
more afraid: he closes his eyes, clenches his fist. Now inside the woman
is standing.</p><p><br></p><p>And you cannot find such beautiful women on this earth because they
are creations of dream – hypnosis byproducts – and the more he becomes
afraid, the more they are there. They will rub with his body, they will
touch his head, they will cling and embrace him. He is completely mad,
but</p><p>this happens. This is happening to you also. Degrees may differ, but
this is what is happening. Whatsoever you are against, you will be
joined with it deep down.</p><p><br></p><p>Never be against anything. To be against evil is to fall a victim.
Then you are falling in the hands of the evil. Indifference: if you
follow indifference, it means it is none of your concern. Somebody is
stealing: that is his karma. He will know and he will have to suffer.
That is not your business at all: you don’t think about it, don’t pay
any attention to it. There is a prostitute: she is selling her body –
that is her business. You don’t have condemnation in you, otherwise you
will be attracted towards her.</p><p><br></p><p>It happened – a very old story – that a saint and a prostitute lived
together. They were neighbors, and then they died. The saint was very
famous. Death came and started trying to take the saint to the hell. And
they died on the Fame day, the prostitute also.</p><p><br></p><p>The saint was surprised because the prostitute was taken on the road
towards heaven. So he said, “What is this? There seems some
misunderstanding. I am the one who should be led towards heaven. And
this is a prostitute!”</p><p><br></p><p>Death said, ’We know, but now if you want, we can explain you: there
is no misunderstanding. There are the orders – that the prostitute has
to be brought to heaven and the saint has to be thrown into hell.” The
saint said, “But why?” Even the prostitute could not believe. She said,
“Something must be wrong. I must be thrown in heaven? And he is a saint
– a great saint. We worshipped him. Take him to heaven.”</p><p><br></p><p>Death said, “No, that’s not possible, because he was a saint just on
the surface, and he was thinking continuously of you. And when you will
sing in the night, he will come and listen to you. He will stand just
near the fence and listen to you. And millions of times he would like to
go to see you, love you; millions of times he dreamed of you. He was
continuously thinking about you. On the lips was the name of God; in the
heart was the image of you.”</p><p><br></p><p>And the same from the opposite direction was true with the
prostitute. She was selling her body, but always thinking that she would
like to have a life like this saint who lives in a temple. “How pure he
is!” She dreamt about the saint, the purity, the saintliness, the virtue
that she is missing. And when customers would have gone, she will pray
to God that “Next time don’t make me a prostitute again. Make me a
worshipper; make me a meditator. I would like to serve in the
temple.”</p><p><br></p><p>And many times she thought to go into the temple, but thinking that
she is so much in sin, it was not good to enter the temple: “The place
is so holy and I am such a sinner.” And many times she wanted to touch
the feet of the saint, but thinking that that will not be good: “I am
not worthy enough to touch his feet.” So when the saint will pass, she
will just collect the dust on the road from where the saint has passed,
and she will worship that dust.</p><p><br></p><p>What you are outwardly is not the question. What is your inner
hypnosis will decide your future course of life. Be indifferent to evil.
Indifference does not mean apathy – remember. These are subtle
distinctions. Indifference doesn’t mean apathy It does not mean that
close your eyes, because even if you close you have taken a standpoint,
attitude. It does not mean don’t bother, because there also is a subtle
condemnation. Indifference simply means as if it doesn’t exist, as if it
is not there. No attitude indifference means. You pass as if it is not
happening.</p><p>Upeksha, the word Patanjali uses, is very beautiful. It is neither
apathy nor antagonism nor escape. It is simple indifference without any
attitude – remember, without any attitude, because you can be
indifferent with an attitude. You can think it is not worth – it is not
worthy of me to think about it. No, then you have an attitude, and a
subtle condemnation is hidden in it. Indifference means simply, ’Who are
you to decide, to judge?” You think about you, ’Who are you? How can you
say what is evil and what is good? Who knows?”</p><p><br></p><p>Because life is such a complexity the evil becomes good, the good
becomes evil – they change. Sinners have been known to reach the
ultimate; saints have been known to be thrown into hell. So who knows?
And who are you? Who is asking you? You take care of yourself. Even if
you can do that, enough you have done. You be more mindful and aware;
then an indifference comes to you without any attitude.</p><p><br></p><p>It happened: Vivekananda, before he went to America and became a
world-famous figure, stayed in Jaipur Maharaja’s palace. The Maharaja
was a lover of Vivekananda and Ramakrishna. As maharajas go, when
Vivekananda came to stay in his palace he made a great festival out of
it, and he called prostitutes to dance and sing in reception... as
maharajas go: they have their own minds. He completely forgot that to
receive a sannyasin with the singing of prostitutes and dancing of
prostitutes doesn’t suit. But he couldn’t know anything else. He always
knew that when you have to receive somebody, drinking, dancing has to be
done.</p><p><br></p><p>And Vivekananda was still immature; he was not a perfect sannyasin
yet. Had he been a perfect sannyasin, then there was indifference – no
problem – but he was not indifferent yet. He has not gone that deep into
Patanjali even. He was a young man, and a very suppressive one who was
suppressing his sex and everything. When he saw the prostitutes, he
simply locked his room and would not come out of it.</p><p><br></p><p>The Maharaja came and he asked his forgiveness. He said, ’We don’t
know. We have never received any sannyasin. We always receive kings, so
we know the ways. So we are sorry, but now it will be too much
insulting, because this is the greatest prostitute in the country – and
very costly. And we have paid, and to say her to move and go will be
insulting to her, and if you don’t come she will feel very much hurt. So
come out.”</p><p><br></p><p>But Vivekananda was afraid to come out; that’s why I say he was still
immature, still not a seasoned sannyasin. Still indifference is not
there – a condemnation: “A prostitute?” – he was very angry, and he
said, “No” Then the prostitute started singing without him, and she sang
a song of a saint. The song is very beautiful. The song says that “I
know that I am not worthy of you, but you could have been a little more
compassionate. I am dirt on the road; that I know. But you need not be
so antagonistic to me. I am nobody – ignorant, a sinner. But you are a
saint – why are you afraid of me?”</p><p><br></p><p>It is said Vivekananda heard from his room. The prostitute was
weeping and singing, and he felt – he felt the whole situation of what
he is doing. It is immature, childish. Why he is afraid? Fear exists
only if you are attracted. You will be afraid of women if you are
attracted of women. If you are not attracted, the fear disappears. What
is the fear? An indifference comes without any antagonism.</p><p><br></p><p>He opened the door: he couldn’t contain himself, he was defeated by
the prostitute. The prostitute became victorious; he had to come out. He
came and he sat, and he wrote in his diary that “A new</p><p>revelation has been given to me by the divine. I was afraid... must
be some lust within me. That’s why I was afraid. But the woman defeated
me completely, and I have never seen such a pure soul. The tears were so
innocent and the singing and the dancing were so holy that I would have
missed. And sitting near her, for the first time I became aware that it
is not a question who is there outside; it is a question what is.”</p><p>That night he wrote in his diary that ’Now I can even sleep with that
woman in the bed and there will be no fear.” He transcended. That
prostitute helped him to transcend. This is a miracle. Ramakrishna
couldn’t help and a prostitute helped him. So nobody knows from where
the help will come. Nobody knows what is evil and what is good. Who can
decide? Mind is impotent and helpless. So don’t take any attitude: that
is the meaning of being indifferent.</p><p>THE MIND ALSO BECOMES TRANQUIL BY ALTERNATELY EXPELLING AND RETAINING
THE BREATH.</p><p>Patanjali gives other alternatives also. If you can do this – being
happy with happy people, friendly; compassion with the miserable, joy
with the virtuous, indifference with the evil ones – if you can do this,
then you enter from the transformation of the mind towards the
supermind. If you cannot do – because it is difficult, not easy – then
there are other ways. Don’t feel depressed.</p><p>Says Patanjali:</p><p><br></p><p>THE MIND ALSO BECOMES TRANQUIL BY ALTERNATELY EXPELLING AND RETAINING
THE BREATH.</p><p>Then you enter through the physiology. This is entering through the
mind – the first: the second is entering through the physiology.</p><p>Breathing and thinking are deeply connected, as if they are two poles
of one thing. You also sometimes become aware, if you are a little
mindful, that whenever the mind changes, the breathing changes. For
example, you are angry: immediately the breathing changes, the rhythm is
gone. The breathing has a different quality. It is non-rhythmic.</p><p>When you have passion, lust, sex takes over, the breathing changes;
it becomes feverish, mad. when you are silent, just not doing anything,
just feeling very relaxed, the breathing has a different rhythm. If you
watch, ’and Patanjali must have watched very deeply... he says if you
watch deeply you can find what type of breathing and its rhythm creates
what type of mind. If you feel friendly, the breathing is different. If
you feel antagonistic, angry, the breathing is different. So either
change the mind and the breathing will change, or you can do the
opposite: change the breathing and the mind will change. Change the
rhythm of breathing, and the mind will immediately change.</p><p>When you feel happy, silent, joyous, remember the rhythm of the
breathing. Next time when anger comes, you don’t allow the breathing to
change; you retain the rhythm of breathing as if you are happy. Anger is
not possible then because the breathing creates the situation. The
breathing forces the inner glands in the body which release chemicals in
the blood.</p><p>That’s why you become red when you are angry: certain chemicals have
come into the blood, and you become feverish. Your temperature goes
high. The body is ready to fight or take flight; the body is in an
emergency. Through hammering of the breathing, this change comes.</p><p>Don’t change the breathing. Just retain as if you are silent; just
the breathing just has to follow a silent pattern – you will feel it
impossible to become angry. When you are feeling very passionate, lust,
sex takes over. Just try to be tranquil in the breathing, and you feel
sex has disappeared.</p><p><br></p><p>Here he suggests a method:</p><p><br></p><p>THE MIND ALSO BECOMES TRANQUIL BY ALTERNATELY EXPELLING AND RETAINING
THE BREATH.</p><p><br></p><p>You can do two things: whenever you feel the mind is not tranquil –
tense, worried, chattering, anxiety, constantly dreaming – do one thing:
first exhale deeply. Always start by exhaling. Exhale deeply: as much as
you can, throw the air out. With the throwing of the air the mood will
be thrown out, because breathing is everything.</p><p><br></p><p>And then expel the breath as far as possible. Take the belly in and
retain for few seconds – don’t inhale. Let the air be out, and you don’t
inhale for few seconds. Then allow the body to inhale. Inhale deeply –
as much as you can. Again stop for few seconds. The same should be the
gap as you retain the breath out – if you retain for three seconds,
retain the breath in three seconds. Throw it out; retain for three
seconds. Take in; retain for three seconds. But it has to be thrown out
completely. Exhale totally and inhale totally, and make a rhythm.
Retain, in; retain, out. Retain, in; retain, out. Immediately you will
feel a change coming into your whole being. The mood is gone. A new
climate has entered into you.</p><p><br></p><p>What happens? Why is it so? For many reasons: one, when you start
creating this rhythm, your mind is completely diverted. You cannot be
angry, because a new thing has started, and mind cannot have two things
together. Your mind is now filled with exhaling, inhaling, retaining,
creating a rhythm. You are completely absorbed in it, the cooperation
with anger is broken: one thing.</p><p><br></p><p>This exhaling, inhaling, cleanses the whole body. When you exhale out
and retain for three seconds or five seconds – as much as you want, as
much as you can – what happens inside? The whole body throws all that is
poisonous into the blood. Air is out and the body gets a gap. In that
gap all the poisons are thrown out. They come to the heart, they
accumulate there – poisonous gases, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, they all
gather together there.</p><p><br></p><p>You don’t give a chance for them to gather together. You go on
breathing in and out. There is no gap, no pause. In that pause, a gap is
created, an emptiness. In that emptiness, everything flows and fills it.
Then you take a deep inhalation and then you retain. All those poisonous
gases become mixed with the breathing; then you again exhale and throw
them out. Again pause. Let the poisons gather. And this is a way of
throwing things out.</p><p><br></p><p>Mind and breath are so much connected – have to be, because breathing
is life. A man can be without mind, but cannot be without breathing.
Breathing is deeper than mind. Your brain can be operated completely;
you will be alive if you can breathe. If the breathing continues, you
will be alive. The brain can be taken out completely. You will vegetate,
but you will be alive. You will not be able to open the eyes and talk or
do anything, but on the bed you can be alive, vegetating for many years.
But mind cannot If the breathing stops, mind disappears.</p><p>Yoga found this basic thing – that breathing is deeper than thinking.
If you change breathing, you change thinking. And once you know the key,
that breathing has the key, you can create any climate that you want: it
is up to you. The way you breathe it depends on it. Just you do one
thing: for seven days, you just make a notebook of the different types
of breathing that happen with different moods. You are angry: take a
notebook and just count breathing – how much you inhale and how much you
exhale. Five counts you inhale, three counts you exhale – note it
down.</p><p><br></p><p>Sometime you are feeling very, very beautiful – note it down, what is
the proportion of inhalation and exhalation, what is the length, is
there any pause – note it down. And for seven days just make a diary to
feel your own breathing, how it is connected with your moods. Then you
can sort it out. Then whenever you want to drop a mood, just use the
opposite pattern. Or, if you want to bring a mood, then use the
pattern.</p><p><br></p><p>Actors, knowingly, unknowingly, come to know it because sometimes
they have to be angry without being angry. So what they will do? They
will have to create the breathing pattern. They may not be aware, but
they will start breathing as if they are angry, and soon the blood
rushes in and poisons are released. And without being angry their eyes
are red, and they are in a subtle anger state without being angry. They
have to make love without being in love; they have to show love without
being in love. How they do it? They know a certain secret of yoga.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why I always say a yogi can become the most perfect actor. He
isl His stage is vast, that’s all. He is acting – not acting on the
stage, but on the stage of the world. He is an actor; he is not a doer.
And the difference is that he is taking part in a great drama and he can
remain a witness to it and he can remain aloof and detached.</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN MEDITATION PRODUCES EXTRAORDINARY SENSE PERCEPTIONS, THE MIND
GAINS CONFIDENCE AND THIS HELPS PERSEVERANCE.</p><p><br></p><p>If you work out your breathing pattern, and you find the secret keys
how to change the climate of the mind how to change the moods... And if
you work from both the poles, that will be better. And try to be
friendly towards happy, indifferent towards the evil, and continue the
change and transformation of your breathing patterns also. Then there
will be extraordinary sense perceptions.</p><p><br></p><p>If you have taken LSD, marijuana, hashish, then you know
extraordinary sense perceptions happen. You look ordinary things, and
they become extraordinary. Aldous Huxley remembers that when he took for
the first time LSD he was sitting before an ordinary chair, and when he
became more and more deep with the drug, when he was on, the chair
immediately started changing color. Radiant it became: an ordinary chair
– he had never paid any attention to it – became so beautiful, many
colors coming out of it, as if it is made of diamonds. Such beautiful
shapes and nuances that he couldn’t believe his eyes, what is happening.
Later on he remembered this must have happened to Van Gogh, because he
has painted a chair almost exactly the same.</p><p><br></p><p>A poet need not take LSD. He has an inbuilt system of throwing LSD in
the body. That is the difference between a poet and an ordinary man.
That’s why they say a poet is born, not made: because he has an
extra-ordinary body structure. The chemicals in his body have a
different quantity and quality to them. That’s why where you don’t see
anything he sees miracles. You see an ordinary tree, and he sees
something unbelievable. You see ordinary clouds: a poet, if he is really
a poet, never sees anything ordinary; everything is extra-ordinarily
beautiful.</p><p>The same happens to a yOgi: because when you change your breathing
and your attitudes, your body chemistry changes its pattern; you are
going through a chemical transformation, and then your eyes become
clear, a new perceptivity happens. The old same tree becomes absolutely
new. You never knew the shade of its green: it becomes radiant. The
whole world all around you takes a new shape. It is a paradise now – not
the ordinary old rotten earth.</p><p><br></p><p>People around you are no more the same. Your ordinary wife becomes a
most beautiful woman. Everything changes with your clarity of
perception. When your eyes change, everything changes. Says
Patanjali,</p><p><br></p><p>WHEN MEDITATION PRODUCES EXTRAORDINARY SENSE PERCEPTIONS, THE MIND
GAINS CONFIDENCE AND THAT HELPS PERSEVERANCE.</p><p><br></p><p>Then you become confident that you are on the right path. The world
is becoming more and more beautiful the ugliness is disappearing. The
world is becoming more and more a harmony; the discord is disappearing.
The world iS becoming more and more home, you are feeling more and more
at ease in it. It is friendly. It is a love affair with you and the
universe. You become more confident, and more perseverance comes to your
effort.</p><p><br></p><p>ALSO, MEDITATE ON THE INNER LIGHT WHICH IS SERENE, BEYOND ALL
SORROW.</p><p><br></p><p>This can be done only when you have attained a certain quality Of
perceptivity. Then you can close the eyes and you can find a flame – a
beautiful flame near the heart, a blue light. But right now you cannot
see it. It is there, it has been always there. When you die, that blue
light goes out of your body. But you cannot see it because when you were
alive you couldn’t see it.</p><p><br></p><p>And others will also be not able to see it, that something is going
out; but Kirlian in Soviet Russia, he has taken photographs with very
sensitive films. When a person dies, something happens around. Some
body-energy, some light-like thing, leaves, goes and disappears into the
cosmos. That light is always there: that is your center of being. It is
near the heart – with a blue flame.</p><p><br></p><p>When you have some perception, you can see the beautiful world all
around you – when your eyes are clear. You close them and you move
nearer the heart; you try to find what is there. First you will feel
darkness. It is just like as you come from the outside on a hot sunny
day inside the room, and you feel everything is dark. But wait Let the
eyes be attuned with the darkness, and soon you start seeing things in
the house.</p><p><br></p><p>You have been outside for millions of lives. When for the first time
you come in, nothing is there except darkness, emptiness. But wait It
will take few days – even few months, but just wait, close the eyes and
look down in the heart. Suddenly, one day it happens: you see a light, a
flame. Then concentrate on that flame.</p><p><br></p><p>Nothing is more blissful than that. Nothing is more dancing, singing,
musical, harmonious like that inner blue light within your heart. And
the more you concentrate, the more you become tranquil, silent, calm,
collected. then there is no darkness for you. When your heart is filled
with light, the whole universe is filled with light.</p><p><br></p><p>ALSO, MEDITATE ON THE INNER LIGHT WHICH IS SERENE AND BEYOND ALL
SORROW.</p><p>ALSO, MEDITATE ON ONE WHO HAS ATTAINED DESIRELESSNESS.</p><p><br></p><p>That tool All alternatives Patanjali is giving you A veetaraga, one
who has gone beyond all desires – also meditate on him. Mahavira,
Buddha, Patanjali – your own – Zarathustra, Mohammed, Christ or anybody
you feel an affinity and love... Meditate on one who has gone beyond
desires. Meditate on your Master, on your guru, who has gone beyond
desires. How it will help? It helps, because when you meditate on
someone who has gone beyond desires he becomes a magnetic force in you.
You allow him to enter within you; he pulls you out of yourself. This
becomes your availability to him.</p><p><br></p><p>If you meditate on someone who has gone beyond desires, you will
become like him sooner or later, because meditation makes you like the
object of meditation itself. If you meditate on money, you will become
just like money. Go and look at a miser; he has no more a soul. He has
only a bank balance; he has nothing inside. If you listen, you will just
hear notes, rupees: you will not find any heart there. Whatsoever you
pay your attention, you become like it. So be aware. Don’t pay attention
to something you would not like to become. Only pay attention to
something you would like to become, because this is the beginning. The
seed is sown with the attention, and soon it will become a tree.</p><p><br></p><p>You sow the seeds of hell, and when it becomes a tree then you say,
“Why I am so miserable?n You always pay attention to the wrong; you
always look to that which is negative. You always pay attention to the
fault; then you become faulty.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t pay attention to the fault. Pay attention to the beautiful. Why
count the thorns? Why not see the flower? Why count the nights? Why not
count the days? If you count the nights, then there are two nights and
only one day between the two. If you count the days, then there are two
days and only one night in between. And it makes a lot of difference.
Look at the light side if you want to become light; look at the dark if
you want to become dark.</p><p><br></p><p>Says Patanjali:</p><p><br></p><p>ALSO, MEDITATE ON ONE WHO HAS ATTAINED DESIRELESSNESS.</p><p><br></p><p>Seek a Master; surrender to a Master. Be attentive to him. Listen,
watch, eat and drink him. Let him enter you; allow your heart to be
filled with him. Soon you will be on a journey, because the object of
attention ultimately becomes the goal of your life. And attention is a
secret relationship. Through attention you become the object of your
attention.</p><p><br></p><p>Krishnamurti goes on saying, “The observer becomes the observed.” He
is right: whatsoever you observe, you will become. So be alert Beware
Don’t observe something which you would not like to become, because that
is your goal; you are sowing the seeds.</p><p><br></p><p>Live near a veetaraga – a man who is beyond desires. Live near a man
who has no more to fulfill here, who is fulfilled. His very
fulfilledness will overflood you, and he will become a catalyst.</p><p><br></p><p>He will not do anything, because a man who is beyond desires cannot
do anything. Even he cannot help you because help is also a desire. Much
help comes through him, but he doesn’t help you. He becomes a catalyst
without doing anything, if you allow him; he drops into your heart and
his very presence crystallizes you.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part8>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

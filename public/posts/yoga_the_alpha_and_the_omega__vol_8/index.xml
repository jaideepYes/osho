‌CHAPTER 10
Nowhere to go
20 April 1976 am in Buddha Hall
Question 1
I FEEL LOST – THERE IS NO WAY BACK TO MY OLD LIFE – THE BRIDGES ARE BROKEN. AND I DON’T SEE A WAY IN FRONT OF ME.
THERE is none. The way is just an illusion of the mind. The mind goes on dreaming about the way to reach its goals, its desires.</description>

‌CHAPTER 2
And a perfect liar at that
12 April 1976 am in Buddha Hall
Question 1
OSHO, WILL YOUR DISCIPLES ATTAIN BY SUDDEN ENLIGHTENMENT, OR BY A SLOW, STEP-BY STEP GROWTH? IS YOUR PATHLESS PATH FOR ANYBODY, OR ONLY FOR RARE EXCEPTIONS?
THE first thing to be understood is that the very word “attainment” is nonspiritual. It is part of your greed. The idea to attain is very worldly.</description>

‌CHAPTER 4
Your balloon is missing
14 April 1976 am in Buddha Hall
Question 1
IS IT POSSIBLE TO BE CONSCIOUS OF ENLIGHTENMENT, AND BE ENLIGHTENED? CAN THE THOUGHT OF BEING ENLIGHTENED CREATE EGO IN ONE? KINDLY EXPLAIN.
THE first thing to be understood is: what is ego. The ego is not very substantial. In fact it is not. It is just an idea, a substitute without which it will be difficult for you to live.</description>

‌CHAPTER 6
You can’t corner a madman
16 April 1976 am in Buddha Hall
Question 1
BELOVED OSHO, YOU ARE SO TREMENDOUSLY SUPERB AND DISARMING THAT SOMETIMES I WONDER, HAVE YOU EVER BEEN IN A CORNER?
To be in a corner, one needs to be logical in the first place. I am not logical; you cannot force me in a corner. I am so illogical that it is impossible to force me in a corner.</description>

‌CHAPTER 7
Beyond the error of experiencing
17 April 1976 am in Buddha Hall
36. EXPERIENCE IS THE RESULT OF THE INABILITY TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN PURUSHA, PURE CONSCIOUSNESS, AND SATTVA, PURE INTELLIGENCE, ALTHOUGH THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY DISTINCT.
PERFORMING SAMYAMA ON THE SELF-INTEREST BRINGS KNOWLEDGE OF THE PURUSHA SEPARATED FROM THE KNOWLEDGE OF OTHERS.
37. FROM THIS FOLLOWS INTUITIONAL HEARING, TOUCHING, SEEING, TASTING, AND SMELLING.</description>

PLEASE EXPLAIN AGAIN HOW NOT TO GET IDENTIFIED OR, AT LEAST, WHY I STILL DON’T UNDERSTAND YOU.</description>

BY PERFORMING SAMYAMA ON THE STRENGTH OF AN ELEPHANT, THE STRENGTH OF AN ELEPHANT IS OBTAINED.\n26. BY DIRECTING THE LIGHT OF THE SUPERPHYSICAL FACULTY, KNOWLEDGE IS GAINED OF THE SUBTLE, THE HIDDEN, AND THE DISTANT.\n27. BY PERFORMING SAMYAMA ON THE SUN, KNOWLEDGE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM IS GAINED.\nI HAVE heard one beautiful story. Once there was a great sculptor, a painter, a great artist. His art was so perfect that when he would make a statue of a man, it was difficult to say who is the man and who is the statue. It was so lifelike, so alive, so similar. An astrologer told him that his death is approaching, he is going to die soon. Of course, he became very much afraid and frightened, and as every man wants to avoid death, he also wanted to avoid. He thought about it, meditated, and he found a clue. He made his own statues, eleven in number, and when Death knocked on his door and the Angel of Death entered, he stood hidden among his own eleven statues. He stopped his breathing.\n2\nThe Angel of Death was puzzled, could not believe his own eyes. It had never happened; it was so irregular. God has never been known to create two persons alike; he always creates the unique. He has never believed in any routine. He is not like an assembly line. He is absolutely against carbons; he creates only originals. What has happened? Twelve persons in all, absolutely alike? Now, whom to take away? Only one has to be taken away. Death, the Angel of Death, could not decide. Puzzled, worried, nervous, he went back. He asked God, “What have you done? There are twelve persons exactly alike, and I am only supposed to bring one. How should I choose?”\nGod laughed. He called the Angel of Death close to him, and he uttered in his ears the formula, the clue how to find the real from the unreal. He gave him a mantra and told him, “Just go, and utter it in that room where that artist is hiding himself among his own statues.”\nThe Angel of Death asked, “How is it going to work?” God said, “Don’t be worried. Just go and try.”\nThe Angel of Death came, not yet believing how it is going to work, but when God had said, he had to do it. He came in the room, looked around, and not addressing anybody in particular, he said, “Sir, everything is perfect except one thing. You have done well, but you have missed at one point. One error is there.”\nThe man completely forgot that he is hiding. He jumped; he said, “What error?”\nAnd Death laughed. And Death said, “You are caught. This is the only error: you cannot forget yourself. Come on, follow me.”\nDeath is of the ego. If the ego exists, death exists. The moment the ego disappears, death disappears. You are not going to die, remember; but if you think that you are, you are going to die. If you think that you are a being, then you are going to die. This false entity of the ego is going to die, but if you think of yourself in terms of nonbeing, in terms of non-ego, then there is no death – already you have become deathless. You have always been deathless; now you have recognized the fact.\nThe artist was caught because he could not disappear into nonbeing.\nBuddha says in his DHAMMAPADA: If you can see death, death cannot see you. If you can die before death comes, then death cannot come to you; and there is no need to make statues. That is not going to help. Deep down you have to destroy one statue, not to create eleven more. You have to destroy the image of the ego. There is no need to create more statues and more images. Religion, in a way, is destructive. In a way, it is negative. It annihilates you – annihilates you completely and utterly.\nYou come to me with some ideas to attain some fulfillment, and I am here to destroy you completely. You have your ideas; I have my own. You would like to be fulfilled – fulfilled in your ego – and I would like you to drop the ego, to dissolve, to disappear, because only then is there fulfillment. The ego knows only emptiness; it is always unfulfilled. By the very nature, by its very intrinsic nature, it cannot attain to fulfillment. When you are not, fulfillment is. Call it God, or give it a name Patanjali would like – samadhi – the attainment of the ultimate, but it comes when you disappear.\nThese sutras of Patanjali are scientific methods how to dissolve, how to die, how to commit real suicide. I call it real because if you kill your body that is unreal suicide. If you kill your self that is authentic suicide.\nAnd that is the paradox: that if you die, you attain to eternal life. If you cling to life, you will die a thousand and one times. You will go on... you will go on being born and dying again and again and again. It is a wheel. If you cling, you move with the wheel.\nDrop out of the wheel of life and death. How to drop out of it? It seems so impossible because you have never thought of yourself as a nonbeing, you have never thought of yourself as just space, pure space, with nobody there inside.\nThese are the sutras. Each sutra has to be understood very deeply. A sutra is a very condensed thing. A sutra is like a seed. You have to accept it deep down in your heart; your heart has to become a soil for it. Then it sprouts, and then the meaning.\nI can only persuade you to be open so that the seed can fall right in place within you, so that the seed can move into the deep darkness of your nonbeing. In that darkness of your nonbeing, it will start being alive. A sutra is a seed. Intellectually, it is very easy to understand it. Existentially, to attain to its meaning is arduous. But that’s what Patanjali would like, that’s what I would like.\nSo don’t just be intellectuals here. Get en rapport with me, get in tune with me. Don’t just listen to me; rather, be with me. Listening is secondary; being with me is primary, basic – just to be in my company. Allow yourself to be totally here-now with me, in my presence, because that death has happened to me. It can become infectious. I have committed that suicide. If you come close to me, if you are in tune with me even for a single moment, you will have a glimpse of death.\nAnd, Buddha is right when he says, “If you can see death, death will not be able to see you,” because the moment you see death you have transcended death. Then there is no death for you.\nThe first sutra:\nBY PERFORMING SAMYAMA ON THE TWO TYPES OF KARMA, ACTIVE AND DORMANT, OR UPON OMENS AND PORTENTS, THE EXACT TIME OF DEATH CAN BE PREDICTED.\nMany things. First, why be worried about the exact time of death? How is it going to help? What is the point of it? If you ask Western psychologists, they will almost call it abnormal morbidity. Why be concerned with death? Avoid. Go on believing that death is not going to happen – at least not to you. It always happens to somebody else. You have seen people die, you have never seen yourself die, so why be afraid? You may be the exception. But nobody is an exception; and death has already happened in your birth, so you cannot avoid it.\nNow the birth is beyond your power. You cannot do anything about it; it has already happened. It is already past; it is already done. You cannot undo it. Death is yet to happen: something is possible to be done about it.\nThe whole of Eastern religion depends on the vision of death, because that is the possibility which is going to happen. If you know it beforehand, tremendous is the possibility. Many doors open. Then\nyou can die in your own way, then you can die with a signature of your own on your death. Then you can manage not to be born again – that is the whole meaning. It is not morbid. It is very, very scientific. When everybody is going to die, this is absolutely foolish not to think about death, not to meditate upon death, not to focus upon it, not to come to a deep understanding about it.\nIt is going to happen. If you know, much is possible.\nPatanjali says even the exact date, the hour, the minute, the second of death can be known beforehand. If you know exactly when death is coming, you can prepare. Death has to be received like a great guest. It is not the enemy. In fact it is a god given gift. It is a great opportunity to pass through. It can become a breakthrough: if you can die alert, conscious, aware, you will never be born again – and there will be no death anymore. If you miss, you will be born again. If you go on missing, you will be continuously born again and again, unless you learn the lesson of death.\nLet me say it in this way: the whole of life is nothing but a learning about death, a preparation for death. That’s why death comes in the end. It is the pinnacle, the crescendo, the very climax, the peak.\nIn the West particularly, contemporary psychologists have become aware that in a deep sex act a certain peak can be attained, a climax, a great orgasm, which is tremendously fulfilling, exhilarating, ecstatic. You are cleansed; you come out of it rejuvenated, fresh, again young, again alive – all the dust gone, as if you have taken a great shower, an energy shower. But they have not yet come to know that the sex act is a very minor death; and one who can achieve deep orgasm is one who allows himself to die in love. It is a minor death, nothing to be compared with death. Death is the greatest orgasm there is.\nThe intensity of death is such that almost always people become unconscious. They cannot face it. The moment death comes, you are so afraid, so full of anxiety, to avoid you become unconscious. Almost ninety-nine percent of people die unconsciously. They miss the opportnity.\nTo know death beforehand is just a method to help you prepare so when death comes you are perfectly alert and aware, waiting, ready to go with death, ready to surrender, ready to embrace death. Once you have accepted death in awareness, there is no longer any birth for you – you have learned the lesson. Now there is no coming back to the school again. This life is just a school, a discipline – a discipline to learn death. It is not morbid.\nThe whole of religion is concerned with death, and if some religion is not concerned with death, then it is not religion at all. It may be a sociology, an ethics, a morality, a politics, but it cannot be religion. Religion is the search of the deathless; but that deathless is possible only through the door of death.\nThe first sutra says, “By performing samyama on the two types of karma, active and dormant, or upon omens and portents, the exact time of death can be predicted.” The Eastern analysis of karma says that there are three types of karma. Let us understand them.\nFirst is called sanchita. Sanchita means the total, the total of all your past lives. Whatsoever you have done, howsoever you have reacted to situations, whatsoever you have thought and desired, achieved, missed – the total – the total of your doings, thinkings, feelings of all the lives is called sanchita. Sanchita: the word means the all, the accumulated all.\nThe second type of karma is known as prarabdha. The second type of karma is that part of sanchita which you have to fulfill in this life, which has to be worked out in this life. You have lived many lives; you have accumulated much. Now a part of it will have the opportunity to be acted out, realized, suffered, passed through in this life. Only a part of it, because this life has a limitation – seventy, eighty, or a hundred years. In a hundred years you cannot live all the past karmas – the sanchita, the accumulated – only a part of it. That part is called prarabdha.\nThen there is a third type of karma which is known as kriyaman. That is day today karma. First the accumulated whole, then a small portion of it for this life, then even a smaller portion of it for today or for this moment. Each moment there is an opportunity to do something or not to do something. Somebody insults you: you become angry. You react, you do something; or, if you are aware, you simply watch, you don’t become angry. You simply remain a witness. You don’t do anything; you don’t react. You remain cool and collected; you remain centered. The other has not been able to disturb you.\nIf you are disturbed by the other and you react, then the kriyaman karma falls into the deep reservoir of the sanchita. Then you are accumulating again; then for future lives you are accumulating. If you don’t react, then a past karma is fulfilled – you must have insulted this man in some past life, now he has insulted you; the account is closed. Finished. A man who is aware will feel happy that at least this part is finished. He has become a little more free.\nSomebody came and insulted Buddha. Buddha remained quiet, he listened attentively, and then he said, “Thank you.” The man was very much puzzled; he said, “Have you gone mad? I am insulting you, hurting you, and you simply say thank you?” Buddha said, “Yes, because I was waiting for you. I had insulted you in the past, and I was waiting – unless you come I will not be totally free. Now you are the last man; my accounts are closed. Thank you for coming. You might have waited, you might not have come in this life, then I would have had to wait for you. And I don’t say anything anymore, because enough is enough. I don’t want to create another chain.”\nThen the kriyaman karma, the day-to-day karma, does not fall into the reservoir, does not add to it; in fact, the reservoir is a little less than it was. The same is true about prarabdha – the whole life, this life. If in this life you go on reacting, you are creating the reservoir more and more. You will have to come again and again. You are creating too many chains; you will be in bondage.\nTry to understand the Eastern concept of freedom. In the West freedom has a connotation of political freedom. In India we don’t bother much about political freedom, because we say unless one is spiritually free, it makes not much difference whether you are politically free or not. The fundamental thing is to be spiritually free.\nThe bondage is created by the karmas. Whatsoever you do in unawareness becomes a karma. Any action done in unawareness becomes a karma because any action done in unawareness is not action at all; it is a reaction. When you do something in full awareness it is not a reaction; it is an action, spontaneous, total. It leaves no trace. It is complete in itself; it is not incomplete. If it is incomplete then some day or other it will have to be completed. So if in this life you remain alert, then the prarabdha disappears and your reservoir becomes more and more empty. In a few lives the reservoir becomes absolutely empty.\nThis sutra says, “By performing samyama on the two types of karma.” Patanjali means sanchita\nand prarabdha because the kriyaman is nothing but a part of prarabdha, so he divides in two.\nWhat is samyama? That has to be understood. Samyama is the greatest synthesis of human consciousness, the synthesis of three: dharana, dhyan, samadhi.\nOrdinarily, your mind is continuously jumping from one object to another. Not for a single moment are you in tune with one object. You go on jumping. Your mind goes on constantly moving; it is like a flux. This moment something is in the focus of the mind, next moment something else, next moment still something else. This is the ordinary state of mind.\nThe first step out of it is dharana. Dharana means concentration – fixing your whole consciousness on one object, not allowing the object to disappear, bringing again and again your consciousness on the object so that the unconscious habit of the mind of continuous flux can be dropped; because once the habit of continuous change can be dropped, you attain to an integrity, to a crystallization. When there are so many objects moving continuously, you remain so many. Understand it. You remain divided because your objects are divided.\nFor example, you love one woman today, another woman tomorrow, another woman the third day. That will create a division in you. You cannot be one; you will become many. You will become a crowd. Hence the Eastern insistence to create a love in which you can remain for a longer period, as long as possible. There have been experiments in the East in which a couple has remained a couple for many lives together. Again and again the same woman, the same man: that gives an integrity. Too much change erodes your being, splits you. So if in the West the schizophrenia is becoming almost a normal thing, it is not something to be wondered at. It is not strange; it is natural. Everything is changing.\nI have heard that one film actress in Hollywood got married to her eleventh husband. She came home, introduced the new dad to the children. The children brought a register, and they said to the dad, “Please sign it, because today you are here, tomorrow you may be gone; and we are accumulating the signatures, autographs, of all our dads.”\nYou go on changing houses; you go on changing everything. In America the average limit of a person’s job is three years. The job is also continuously changing. The house – the average limit of a person staying in one town is also three years. And the average limit of marriage is also three years. Somehow three years seems to be very important. It seems if you remain the fourth year with the same woman there is fear that you may get settled. If you remain in the same job more than three years there is fear that you may get settled. So people go on; they have become almost vagabonds. That creates divisions inside you.\nIn the East we tried to give a job to a person as part of his life. A man was born in a Brahmin house: he remained a Brahmin. That was a great experiment to give stability. A man was born in a shoemaker’s house: he remained a shoemaker. The marriage, the family, the job, the town – people were born in the same town and they would die in the same town. Lao Tzu remembers, “I have heard that in the ancient days people had not gone beyond the river.” They had heard dogs barking on the other side, the other shore. They had inferred that there must be a town because in the evening they had seen smoke rising – people must be cooking. They had heard dogs barking, but they had not bothered to go and see. People were so harmoniously settled.\nThis constant change simply says that your mind is feverish. You cannot stay longer at anything; then your whole life becomes a life of continuous change – as if a tree is being uprooted again and again and again and never gets the right time to send its roots deep down into the earth. The tree will be alive only for the name’s sake. It will not be able to bloom, not possible, because before flowers come, the roots have to settle.\nSo, concentration means bringing your consciousness to one object and becoming capable of retaining it there – any object. If you are looking at a rose flower, you continuously look at it. Again and again the mind wanders, goes here and there; you bring it back. You tame the mind – you tame the bull. You bring it back to the rose. The mind goes again; you bring it back. By and by, the mind starts being with the rose for longer periods. Once your mind remains with the rose for a long period, you will be able for the first time to know what a rose is. It is not just a rose: God has flowered in it. The fragrance is not only of the rose; the fragrance is divine. But you never were en rapport with it for long.\nSit with a tree and be with it. Sit with your boyfriend or girlfriend and be with him or her, and bring yourself again and again. Otherwise, what is happening? Even if you are making love to a woman, you are thinking of something else – maybe moving in a totally different world. Even in love you are not focused. You miss much. A door opens, but you are not there to see it. You come back when the door is closed again.\nEach moment there are millions of opportunities to see God, but you are not there. He comes and knocks at your doors, but you are not there. You are never found there. You go on roaming around the world. This roaming has to be stopped; that’s what is the meaning of dharana. Dharana is the first step of the great synthesis of samyama.\nThe second step is dhyan. In dharana, in concentration, you bring your mind to a focus: the object is important. You have to bring again and again the object in your consciousness; you are not to lose track of it. The object is important in dharana. The second step is dhyan, meditation. In meditation the object is not important anymore; it becomes secondary. Now, the flow of consciousness becomes important – the very consciousness which is being poured on the object. Any object will do, but your consciousness should be poured in a continuity; there should not be gaps.\nHave you watched? If you pour water from one pot to another, there are gaps. If you pour oil from one pot to another, there are not gaps. Oil has a continuity; water falls discontinuously. Dhyan means, meditation means, your consciousness should be falling on any object of concentration in a continuity. Otherwise it is flickering. It is constantly flickering; it is not a continuous torch. Sometimes it is there, then disappears; then again is there, then disappears; then again is there. In dhyan you have to make it a continuity, an absolute continuity.\nWhen consciousness becomes continuous, you become tremendously strong. For the first time you feel what life is. For the first time, holes in your life disappear. For the first time you are together. Your togetherness means the togetherness of consciousness. If your consciousness is like drops of water and not a continuity, you cannot be really there. Those gaps will be a disturbance. Your life will be very dim and faint; it will not have strength, force, energy. When consciousness flows in a continuous, riverlike phenomenon, you have become a waterfall of energy.\nThis is the second step of samyama, the second ingredient; and then is the third ingredient, the ultimate, that is samadhi. In dharana, concentration, the object is important because you have to choose one object amidst millions. In dhyan, meditation, consciousness is important; you have to make consciousness a continuous flow. In samadhi the subject is important: the subject has to be dropped.\nYou dropped many objects. When there were many objects, you were many subjects, a crowd, a polypsychic existence – not one mind, many minds. People come to me and they say, “I would like to take sannyas, but.…” That “but” brings the second mind. They think they are the same, but the “but” brings another mind. They are not one. They would like to do something and, at the same time, they would not like to do it – two minds. If you watch you will find many minds in you – almost a marketplace.\nWhen there are too many objects, there are too many minds corresponding to them. When there is one object, one mind arises – focused, centered, rooted, grounded. Now this one mind has to be dropped; otherwise you will remain in the ego. The many has been dropped; now drop the one also. In samadhi this one mind has to be dropped. When one mind drops, the one object also disappears because it cannot be there. They always are together.\nIn samadhi only consciousness remains, as pure space.\nThese three together are called samyama. Samyama is the greatest synthesis of human consciousness.\nNow you will be able to understand the sutra: “By performing samyama on the two types of karma, active and dormant, or upon omens and portents, the exact time of death can be predicted.” Now if you concentrate, meditate, and get in tune in samadhi, you can be capable of knowing the exact time of death. If you move your samyama, this great synthesis of consciousness, this great power that has arisen in you; if you move it towards death, you will be able to know immediately when you are going to die.\nHow it happens? When you go in a dark room, you cannot see what is there. When you go with a light, you can see what is there, or what is not there. You move almost in darkness your whole life, so you don’t know how much prarabdha is still there – prarabdha, the karma that you have to fulfill in this life. When you go with samyama, with light burning bright, you bring the flame in; you know how much prarabdha is left. You see the whole house is empty, just in the corner a few things are left, soon they will disappear. Now you can see when you are going to die.\nIt is said about Ramkrishna that he was much too interested in food; in fact obsessed. That is very unlikely. Even his wife, Sharada, used to feel very embarrassed; because he was such a great saint, only with one flaw – and the flaw was that he was much too interested in food. He was interested so much that while he was giving satsang to his disciples, just in the middle he will say, “Wait, I am coming,” and he will go to look into the kitchen, what is being cooked. He will just go there and ask, “What is being prepared today?” and then will come back and start his satsang again.\nHis closest disciples became worried. They said, “This doesn’t look good, Paramhansa. And everything is so perfectly beautiful – never has there walked such a beautiful and perfect man – but this small thing, why can’t you drop it?” He will laugh and will not say anything.\nOne day his wife Sharada insisted too much. He said, “Okay, if you insist, I will tell. My prarabdha is finished; and I am just clinging with this food. If I drop that I am gone.”\nThe wife could not believe this. It is very difficult for wives to believe in their own husbands – even if the husband is a Paramhansa it makes no difference. The wife must have thought that he is befooling, or he is trying to rationalize. Seeing that, Ramkrishna said, “Look, I can see that you are not trusting me, but you will know. The day I am going to die, just three days before that day, three days before my death, I will not look at the food. You will bring my thali in, and I will start looking in another direction; then you can know that only three days more am I to be here.”\nThat too was not believed; they forgot about it. Then, just three days before Ramkrishna died, he was resting, Sharada brought his thali, his food: he turned over, started looking at the other side. Suddenly the wife realized, remembered. The thali fell from her hands, she started crying. Ramkrishna said, “Don’t cry now. Now my work is finished; I need not cling.” And exactly after three days he died.\nHe was clinging in compassion, just trying to create a bondage with one chain. The imprisonment is gone; the prison has disappeared. Out of compassion he was trying to cling, to linger a little longer on this shore, to help those who had gathered around him. But it is difficult to understand a Paramhansa. It is difficult to understand a man who has become a siddha, a Buddha, one who has emptied all his sanchita, all accumulated karmas. It is very difficult. He has no gravitation, so Ramkrishna was clinging to a rock. The rock has gravitation. He was clinging to a rock so that he could linger on this earth a little longer.\nWhen you have samyama, a consciousness fully alert, you can see how much karma is left. It is exactly like when a physician comes and he sees and touches the pulse of a dying man, and he says, “Not more than two, three hours.” What is he saying? By long experience he has come to know how the pulse beats when a person is going to die. Exactly that way, a man who is alert knows how much prarabdha is left – how much pulse – and he knows when he has to go.\nThis can be done in two ways. The sutra says either to focus on death, that is prarabdha karma.… “By performing samyama on the two types of karma, active and dormant, or upon omens and portents, the exact time of death can be predicted.” This can be done in two ways: either you look at the prarabdha or there are a few omens and portents which can be watched.\nFor example, before one person dies, almost exactly near about nine months before, something happens. Ordinarily we are not aware, because we are not aware at all, and the phenomenon is very subtle. I say almost nine months because it differs. It depends: the time between the conception and the birth will be the time. If you were born after nine months being in the womb, then nine months. If you were born after being ten months in the womb, then ten months. If you were born after seven months in the womb, then seven months. It depends on the amount of time between the time of conception and birth. Exactly the same time before death, something clicks in the hara, in the navel center. It has to click because between the conception and birth there was a gap of nine months: nine months you took for birth; exactly the same time will be taken for death. As you prepared nine months in the mother’s womb for birth, you will have to prepare nine months to die. Then the circle will be complete. Something in the navel center happens. Those who are aware, they will immediately know that something has broken in the navel center; now death is coming closer. Approximately nine months.\nOr for example, there are other omens and other portents. A man, before he dies, exactly six months before he dies, becomes by and by incapable of seeing the tip of his own nose because eyes start turning upwards, very slowly. In death they turn completely upwards, but they start the turning, the returning journey, before death. That happens: when a child is born, the child takes almost six months, that is usually – there may be exceptions – the child takes six months to have fixed eyes. Otherwise the eyes are loose. That’s why children can bring both their eyes together near the nose, can take them far away to the corners very easily. Their eyes are still loose. The day a child’s eyes become fixed: if that day comes after six months or nine months or ten or twelve months, then exactly the same will be the time; again the eyes will start becoming loose and moving upwards. That’s why in India villagers say – they must have come to know from yogis – that before a man dies he becomes incapable of seeing the tip of his own nose.\nAnd there are many methods in which yogis continuously watch the tip of their nose. They concentrate on it. People who have been concentrating on it, suddenly one day realize they cannot see their own nose. Now they know the death is approaching near.\nAccording to yoga physiology there are seven centers in man. The first, the genital organs; and the last is sahasrar, in the head; between these two there are five others. Whenever you die, you die from a particular center. That shows your growth that you have been doing in this life. Ordinarily, people die through the genital organ, because the whole life people live around the sex center, continuously thinking of sex, fantasizing about sex, doing everything about sex – as if the whole of life seems to be centered around the sex center. These people die through the sex center. If you have evolved a little and you have attained to love, gone beyond sex, then you will die from the heart center. If you have evolved completely, if you have become a siddha, you will die from the sahasrar.\nThe center you will die from will have an opening because the whole life energy will be released from there.…\nJust a few days before, Vipassana died. Her brother Viyogi was asked to hit her head; that has become symbolic in India. When a person dies and is put on the funeral pyre, the head has to be hit. Just symbolic, because if the person has attained to the ultimate, then the head will break on its own; but the person has not attained. But we hope and pray, and break the skull.\nThe point of release becomes open. This point can be seen. Some day or other, when Western medical science will become aware of yoga physiology, this also will become part of all postmortems – how the person died. Just now they see only whether he died naturally or was poisoned or killed or committed suicide – all ordinary things. The most basic thing they miss, which has to be there on the report – how the person died: from the sex center, from the heart center, or from sahasrar – from where he died. And there is a possibility – and yogis have done much work on it – it can be seen in the body because that particular center breaks, as if an egg has broken and something has gone out of it.\nWhen somebody who has attained to samyama becomes, just three days before he dies, aware from what center he is going to move, almost always he moves from sahasrar. A certain activity, a movement, just at the top of the head starts working three days before one dies.\nThese indications can prepare you how to receive death, and if you know how to receive death in a great celebration, in great joy, in delight – almost dancing and in ecstasy – you will not be born\nagain. Your lesson is complete. You have learned whatsoever was to be learned here on this earth; now you are ready to move beyond for a greater mission, for a greater life, for more unlimited life. Now you are ready to be absorbed by the cosmos, by the whole. You have earned it.\nOne thing more about this sutra. The kriyaman karma, the day to-day karma, is just a very small fragment; in modern psychological terms we can call it the “conscious.” Below it is prarabdha; in modern psychological terms we can call it the “subconscious.” Even below that is sanchita; in modern psychological terms we can call it the “unconscious.”\nOrdinarily, you are not aware of your day to-day activities, so how can you be aware of prarabdha or sanchita? Impossible. So start by becoming aware of day-to-day activities. Walking on the road, be alert. Eating your food, be alert. Remain watchful of what you are doing. Remain with the activity. Don’t go here and there. Don’t do things like a zombie. Don’t move as if you are in deep hypnosis. Whatsoever you are saying, say everything fully alert, so that you are not going to repent ever.\nWhen you say, “I am sorry. I said something which I never wanted to say,” that simply shows you were asleep, not aware. When you say, “I did something, I don’t know why and how. I don’t know how it happened. I have done it in spite of myself,” then remember, you worked asleep. You are a somnambulist walking in sleep.\nMake yourself more and more alert. That is the meaning of being here-now. Right now you are listening to me: you can be just the ears. Right now you are seeing me: you can be just the eyes, fully alert, not even a thought passing through your mind, no disturbance, no cloudiness inside. Just focused on me – totally listening, totally seeing – being with me herenow: that is the first step.\nIf you attain to that, the second step becomes available; then you can move into the subconscious. Then when somebody insults you, you will not become aware only when you become angry. You will become aware immediately somebody has insulted – there, a certain anger has moved into the subconscious depth of your being, just a small wave, very subtle. If you are not very sensitive and aware, you will not know it – unless it erupts into the conscious you will not know it. By and by you will become aware of subtle nuances, subtle shades of emotions – that is prarabdha, the subconscious.\nWhen you become aware of the subconscious, another step will become available to you. The more you grow, the more growth becomes possible to you. You will be able to see, now, the third step, the final step, of becoming aware of sanchita, the accumulated past. Once you move into the unconscious – that means you are taking the light of consciousness into the deepest core of your being – you will become enlightened. That is the meaning of becoming a Buddha – nothing is in the dark now. Every nook and corner is lighted. Then you live, you act, but you don’t accumulate any karma.\nThe second sutra:\nBY PERFORMING SAMYAMA ON FRIENDLINESS, OR ANY OTHER ATTRIBUTE, GREAT STRENGTH IN THAT QUALITY IS OBTAINED.\nFirst one has to become aware, and immediately the second step is: to bring your samyama on the feeling of friendliness. Love, compassion.\nLet me tell you one story:\nIt happened, a great Buddhist monk, Tamino was his name, persevered, worked hard, and entered the state of satori – the state of samyama. And there he was aware of nothing.…\nWhen you are really aware, you are not aware of anything. You are only aware of awareness. That too is not good to say, because then awareness looks like an object. No, you are simply aware of nothing – just aware.\n... And there he was aware of nothing, and his soul was like nothing. And this state was beyond even peace, and he would have been glad to remain in it forever.…\nRemember it, when one attains to samyama, one would like to remain forever in it, one would not like to go out of it – but this is not the end of the journey. This is only half the journey. Unless your samadhi becomes love, unless you bring whatsoever you have found within you to the greater world, unless you share your samadhi with others, you are proving yourself a miser. Samadhi is not the goal; love is the goal. So whenever it will happen to you, any of you, you will also come to a point when one wants not to move out. It is so beautiful, it is so tremendously blissful, who bothers?\n... And this stage was beyond even peace, and he would have been glad to remain in it forever. But as it happened, on that day he had gone out to meditate in the little wood that surrounded his monastery. And as he sat there by the way, lost in meditation, there passed a traveller, and thieves leapt upon him and wounded and robbed him and left him for dead. He cried for aid to Tamino, but Tamino sat there unconscious, seeing and hearing nothing.…\nTamino was sitting there, and the man was dying there, and the man was calling for help; but he was so deep within himself that nothing reached him. He could not hear. He could not see – the eyes were open, but he was not there in the eyes. He has gone to the very rock bottom of his being. Just the body was breathing, but he was not there on the periphery.\nAnd so the man lay bleeding on the ground, and there he was when Tamino returned to earth – came back to his body, came back to his senses. Tamino was dazed and for a long time did not understand what he saw nor knew what he had to do.…\nIt takes a little time to put yourself together again on the periphery. The center is so totally different. You move almost in an absolutely unknown territory. And when you come back it is difficult to again get in tune with the periphery. It is almost like people who have been to the moon: when they come back, for three weeks they have to be put in a special house prepared for them – to get ready again to move on the earth. If immediately after coming back from the moon they go to their home, they will get crazy or mad; because the moon is so different. The gravitation is not much there – one eighth of the earth. One can just jump sixty feet, seventy feet, easily. One can jump on anybody’s terrace, no problem. The gravitation is almost nil. And the moon is so empty, one is dazed. And the silence is so tremendous, uninterrupted for millions of years – so heavy – that when one comes back from the moon, one is coming as if after one has died and is again coming back to the earth.\nWhen the first man walked on the moon, he was not a theist, but suddenly he fell on his knees and started praying. The first thing that has been done on the moon is prayer. What happened to him?\nThe silence was such, it was so deep, and he was so alone, suddenly he remembered God. In that loneliness, in that aloneness, in that solitude, he forgot all about that he didn’t believe in God, that he is a skeptical mind, that he is a doubter. He forgot all. He immediately fell down and started praying.\nWhen one comes from the moon, he has to be reacclimatized to the earth; but this is nothing compared to when you go to the center of your being and come back.\n... Tamino was dazed and for a long time did not understand what he saw nor knew what he had to do. But presently, as the current of his life in the flesh set in again, he went up to the man and bound up his wounds as best he could. But the man’s blood had flowed too long. He looked at Tamino and died – and those eyes Tamino could not forget; and those eyes haunted him; and he was so much disturbed – the whole satori lost – he forgot all about the center. He was puzzled.\nAnd in his eyes, before he died, Tamino saw the look he had seen once on the battlefield; and all his peace, so painfully won, fled from him. He went back to the monastery and passed over onto the island and mounted to the topmost terrace, and there sat down beside one of the images of Gautam Buddha. It was evening, and the setting sun alone shone on the stone face, till it seemed to flush into life.\nTamino looked into the eyes of the face and said, “Lord Buddha, was your gospel true?” And the image answered back, “True and false.”\n“What was true in it?” asked Tamino. “Compassion and love.”\n“And what was false in it?” “Flight from life, escape.” “Must I go back to life?”\nBut the light had faded from the face and it turned to stone again.\nIt is a beautiful story. Yes, Tamino had to come back to life. One has to come back to love from samadhi; hence, Patanjali’s sutra immediately after the samadhi, in which death is experienced: “By performing samyama on friendliness, or any other attribute,” compassion, love, “great strength in that quality is obtained.”\nContemporary psychologists will also agree – up to a certain limit. If you constantly think about something, it starts materializing. You must have heard the name of Emile Coue, or if you have not heard the name you must have heard his slogan: Every day, in every way, I am getting better and better. He treated thousands of patients – in great trouble, people in great trouble – and he helped them tremendously. And this was his only medicine. He will just say to them, “Repeat: every day, in every way, I am getting better and better. Just repeat it, just feel it, just surround yourself with this idea ‘I am getting better, healthier, happier.’” And thousands of people were helped; they came\nout of their illnesses. They came out of their mental diseases. They came out of their troubles and anxieties. They thrived again, they became alive again, and there was nothing in it – just a small mantra.\nBut what happens: you create the world you live in. You create the body also you live in; you create the mind also you live in. You create with your ideas. Whatsoever you think sooner or later becomes a reality. Every thought becomes a thing finally, eventually.\nAnd this is so with such an ordinary mind, which goes on changing the object every moment, goes on jumping from here and there; what to think about samyama? When there is no mind and just the idea of friendliness arises, one becomes so en rapport with it, one becomes it.\nBuddha has said, “The next time I come into the world, my name will be Maitreya, ‘the friend.’” It is very symbolic – whether he is coming or not, that is not the point. But it is very symbolic. He is saying that after becoming a Buddha, one has to become the friend.\nAfter one has attained to samadhi, one has to attain to compassion. Compassion is the criterion whether your samadhi is true or not.\nRemember, don’t be a miser; because habits persist. If in the outside world you are a miser and you cling to things, to money and this and that; when samadhi arises in you, you will cling to samadhi. The clinging will continue – and the clinging has to be dropped. Hence, immediately, after death, when you start feeling the deathless, Patanjali says bring friendliness in, now think of sharing.\nThere are two seas in Palestine. One is filled with fresh and sparkling water. Trees and flowers grow around it. Fish live in it, and its banks are green. The pure waters of this sea, which possess a healing quality, are brought down by the River Jordan from the hills around Mount Hermon...\nJesus loved this river; Jesus loved this sea. Many miracles happened around this place with him.\n... The Master loved this sea, and many of the happier moments of his ministry were spent beside it. It is a place filled to this day with serenity and power.\nThe River Jordan flows on south into another sea. Here there is no life, no song of birds, no children’s laughter. The air hangs sinister and heavy above its water, and neither man nor beast nor bird will drink. This sea is dead.\nWhat makes so mighty a difference between these two seas of Palestine – one so alive, so tremendously alive; and another so dead, so deadly dead?\nThis is the difference: the Sea of Galilee receives but does not keep the waters of River Jordan. For every drop that flows into it, another drop flows out. The more it gives joyfully away, the more it receives in return. This is the sea of life – the Sea of Galilee.\nThe other sea hoards every drop of water reaching it and gives nothing in return. The Sea of Galilee gives and lives. The other sea gives nothing and does not live. It is truly named “The Dead” – the Dead Sea.\nAnd the same is true about human life. You can become the Sea of Galilee or you can become the Dead Sea. If you become the Sea of Galilee, sooner or later you will attract the consciousness of Jesus to you. The Master will walk around you again. Again he will be seen with his disciples near you; again you will be in a totally different world. You will have the touch of the divine. Or you can become the Dead Sea; then go on receiving and don’t give; then go on hoarding and don’t give. How did it become dead? A miser is a dead person; a miser dies every day. Share, whatsoever you have share, and you will receive more. That is the meaning of friendliness.\nAnd Patanjali says bring your samyama to compassion, love, and friendliness; and they will grow. Not that you will become friendly: you will become the friend. Not that you will become friendly: you will become friendship, friendliness. Not that you will love: you will become love, you will be the very quality of love.\nThe third sutra:\nBY PERFORMING SAMYAMA ON THE STRENGTH OF AN ELEPHANT, THE STRENGTH OF AN ELEPHANT IS OBTAINED.\nWhatsoever you want, you bring your samyama to it and it will happen – because you are infinite. Whatsoever form you want to take you can take after samyama. All miracles are possible; it depends on you. If you want to become so powerful like an elephant, you can become. Just by keeping the idea as a seed inside you and showering it with samyama, you will become that. Because of this sutra, many people have done many wrong things. This is a key, but if you want to become something devilish, you can become. You can misuse yoga as much as you can misuse science. Science has released the atomic energy. Now you can use it by dropping it on cities and killing people. You can create more Hiroshimas and Nagasakis – you can make the whole earth a dead, burned place, a cemetery.\nThe same atomic energy can be used creatively. All the poverty that exists on earth can disappear within minutes. All the food that is needed can be created, and all the luxuries that are available only to a very few can become part of the normal life of everybody. Nobody is barring the path, but somehow man does not have that creative understanding.\nYoga has been misused in the same way.\nAll knowledge brings power, and power can be used positively or negatively. I have heard an anecdote:\nA drunk shuffled up to a rich banker and asked for sixpence for a cup of coffee. Being an extremely generous man, the banker handed him a ten-shilling note.\n“Here,” he said, “you can buy yourself twenty cups of coffee with that.” Next evening the banker saw the drunken tramp again.\n“How are you today?” he asked cheerfully.\nThe tramp glared at him. “Why don’t you get lost,” he said rudely. “You and your twenty cups of coffee. They kept me awake all last night.”\nIt depends. A blessing can become a curse. What Patanjali is saying is pure white magic; it is a magical formula. You can make it into a devilish black magic. Then you will be destructive to others – and destructive to yourself. Remember that. That’s why first he says become friendly; then he talks about power.\nPeople like Patanjali are so cautious. They have to be cautious because of you. They watch their every step. First he tells how to attain to samyama; immediately he talks about compassion and friendliness; then he talks about power. Because when you have compassion then power cannot be misused.\nBY DIRECTING THE LIGHT OF THE SUPERPHYSICAL FACULTY, KNOWLEDGE IS GAINED OF THE SUBTLE, THE HIDDEN, AND THE DISTANT.\nEvery dimension becomes available – “of the subtle, the hidden, the distant” – once you know how not to be. Once you know how to be without any ego, once you know how to be a pure consciousness with no subject and no object, everything becomes possible. You can know all. By knowing one all is known.\nBY PERFORMING SAMYAMA ON THE SUN, KNOWLEDGE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM IS GAINED.\nThis sutra is a little complicated – not in itself, but because of the commentators. All the commentators of Patanjali talk about this sutra as if Patanjali is talking about the sun out there. He is not talking about that sun; he cannot talk about that. He is not an astrologer, and he is not interested in astrology. He is interested in man. He is interested in mapping man’s consciousness. And the sun is not of the out.\nIn yoga terminology man is a microcosm. Man is in a subtle way a small universe, condensed into a small existence. The existence, the whole existence, is nothing hut man expanded. This is yoga terminology: microcosm and macrocosm. Whatsoever exists outside also exists exactly inside man.\nJust like the sun, man has a sun inside; and just like the moon, man has a moon inside. And Patanjali is interested in giving you the whole geography of the inner world, of inner man. So when he says, “Bhuwan gyanam surya samyamat” – “By performing samyama on the sun, knowledge of the solar system is gained,” he does not mean the sun that is without. He means the sun that is within.\nWhere is your inner sun? Where is your center of the inner solar system? It is exactly hidden deep in the reproductive system. That’s why sex is hot; it is a sort of heat. We have the expression for animals: whenever a female is ready to be impregnated, we say she is in heat. That phrase is exactly accurate. The sex center is the sun. That’s why sex makes you hot and feverish. When you move in a sex act, you become hotter and hotter and hotter. You touch an almost feverish peak; you perspire; your breathing is disturbed. And after it you feel exhausted. Then you fall into sleep.\nWhen sex is exhausted, immediately the moon starts functioning. When the sun sets the moon comes up. That’s why after the sex act you immediately fall into sleep. The function of the sun is gone; the function of the moon starts.\nSun is the sex center. By performing samyama on it, you will be able to know the whole solar system inside. By performing samyama on the sex center you will become capable of going beyond it. You will know all the secrets of it; but it has nothing to do with the outer sun.\nBut if you know the inner sun, by reflection you can understand the outer sun also. This sun is the sex center of the solar system. That’s why everything alive needs sun. Trees go higher and higher. In Africa they go higher than anywhere else because the forests are so dense and there is much competition; because if you don’t go high you will die. You will not be able to reach to the sun. You will not be available to the sun and the sun will not be available to you. You will not be showered by the energy of life.\nSun is life; sex is life. All life arises out of sun; all life arises out of sex. All life.\nTrees try to reach higher so that they can become available to the sun and the sun becomes available to them. Just watch. The same trees are on this side. These pine-type trees, the same trees are on this side – they have remained small. This side they are throbbing high. Sun is more available on this side; on that side sun is not available.\nSex is the inside sun; the sun is the sex organ of the solar system. By reflection you will be able to understand the outer solar system also, but the basic thing is to understand the inner solar system. So I will insist on this, remember, that Patanjali is mapping the inner ground. And of course it can be started only from the sun because sun is the center. Not the goal, but the center. Not the ultimate, but the center. One has to rise above it, one has to move above it, but it is the beginning. It is not the omega, but it is the alpha.\nOnce Patanjali has said how to attain to samyama, how to transform into compassion, love, and friendship, how to become powerful for compassion, for love; he comes to the inner territory, the inner topography: “By performing samyama on the sun, knowledge of the solar system is gained.”\nThe whole world can be divided between two types of people: the sun people and the moon people, or you can call them yang and yin. The sun is the male; the moon is the female. The sun is aggression, the positive; the moon is receptive, the passive. You can divide the whole existence between sun and moon. And you can divide your body also between sun and moon; yoga has divided.\nIt has divided so minutely that it has divided even your breath, your breathing. One nostril is sun breath, another is moon breath. If you become angry you will breathe from the sun side. If you want to become silent, you will breathe from the moon side. The whole body is divided: one of your sides is male, another side is female. The mind is divided: one part of the mind is male, another part of the mind is female.\nAnd one has to move from the sun towards the moon, and then beyond both.\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"10043","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/yoga_the_alpha_and_the_omega__vol_8/part1/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/yoga_the_alpha_and_the_omega__vol_8/>Yoga, The Alpha and the Omega - Vol 8</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">1 Secrets of death and karma</h1><div class=post-meta>48 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;10043 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/Yoga_The_Alpha_and_the_Omega__Vol_8/part1.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=_index>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

DORMANT, OR UPON OMENS AND PORTENTS, THE EXACT TIME OF DEATH CAN BE
PREDICTED.</p><p><br></p><p>24. BY PERFORMING SAMYAMA ON FRIENDLINESS, OR ANY OTHER ATTRIBUTE,
GREAT STRENGTH IN THAT QUALITY IS OBTAINED.</p><p><br></p><p>25. BY PERFORMING SAMYAMA ON THE STRENGTH OF AN ELEPHANT, THE
STRENGTH OF AN ELEPHANT IS OBTAINED.</p><p><br></p><p>26. BY DIRECTING THE LIGHT OF THE SUPERPHYSICAL FACULTY, KNOWLEDGE IS
GAINED OF THE SUBTLE, THE HIDDEN, AND THE DISTANT.</p><p><br></p><p>27. BY PERFORMING SAMYAMA ON THE SUN, KNOWLEDGE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM
IS GAINED.</p><p><br></p><p>I HAVE heard one beautiful story. Once there was a great sculptor, a
painter, a great artist. His art was so perfect that when he would make
a statue of a man, it was difficult to say who is the man and who is the
statue. It was so lifelike, so alive, so similar. An astrologer told him
that his death is approaching, he is going to die soon. Of course, he
became very much afraid and frightened, and as every man wants to avoid
death, he also wanted to avoid. He thought about it, meditated, and he
found a clue. He made his own statues, eleven in number, and when Death
knocked on his door and the Angel of Death entered, he stood hidden
among his own eleven statues. He stopped his breathing.</p><p><br></p><p>2</p><p>The Angel of Death was puzzled, could not believe his own eyes. It
had never happened; it was so irregular. God has never been known to
create two persons alike; he always creates the unique. He has never
believed in any routine. He is not like an assembly line. He is
absolutely against carbons; he creates only originals. What has
happened? Twelve persons in all, absolutely alike? Now, whom to take
away? Only one has to be taken away. Death, the Angel of Death, could
not decide. Puzzled, worried, nervous, he went back. He asked God, “What
have you done? There are twelve persons exactly alike, and I am only
supposed to bring one. How should I choose?”</p><p><br></p><p>God laughed. He called the Angel of Death close to him, and he
uttered in his ears the formula, the clue how to find the real from the
unreal. He gave him a mantra and told him, “Just go, and utter it in
that room where that artist is hiding himself among his own
statues.”</p><p><br></p><p>The Angel of Death asked, “How is it going to work?” God said, “Don’t
be worried. Just go and try.”</p><p>The Angel of Death came, not yet believing how it is going to work,
but when God had said, he had to do it. He came in the room, looked
around, and not addressing anybody in particular, he said, “Sir,
everything is perfect except one thing. You have done well, but you have
missed at one point. One error is there.”</p><p><br></p><p>The man completely forgot that he is hiding. He jumped; he said,
“What error?”</p><p><br></p><p>And Death laughed. And Death said, “You are caught. This is the only
error: you cannot forget yourself. Come on, follow me.”</p><p><br></p><p>Death is of the ego. If the ego exists, death exists. The moment the
ego disappears, death disappears. You are not going to die, remember;
but if you think that you are, you are going to die. If you think that
you are a being, then you are going to die. This false entity of the ego
is going to die, but if you think of yourself in terms of nonbeing, in
terms of non-ego, then there is no death – already you have become
deathless. You have always been deathless; now you have recognized the
fact.</p><p><br></p><p>The artist was caught because he could not disappear into
nonbeing.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha says in his DHAMMAPADA: If you can see death, death cannot see
you. If you can die before death comes, then death cannot come to you;
and there is no need to make statues. That is not going to help. Deep
down you have to destroy one statue, not to create eleven more. You have
to destroy the image of the ego. There is no need to create more statues
and more images. Religion, in a way, is destructive. In a way, it is
negative. It annihilates you – annihilates you completely and
utterly.</p><p><br></p><p>You come to me with some ideas to attain some fulfillment, and I am
here to destroy you completely. You have your ideas; I have my own. You
would like to be fulfilled – fulfilled in your ego – and I would like
you to drop the ego, to dissolve, to disappear, because only then is
there fulfillment. The ego knows only emptiness; it is always
unfulfilled. By the very nature, by its very intrinsic nature, it cannot
attain to fulfillment. When you are not, fulfillment is. Call it God, or
give it a name Patanjali would like – samadhi – the attainment of the
ultimate, but it comes when you disappear.</p><p>These sutras of Patanjali are scientific methods how to dissolve, how
to die, how to commit real suicide. I call it real because if you kill
your body that is unreal suicide. If you kill your self that is
authentic suicide.</p><p><br></p><p>And that is the paradox: that if you die, you attain to eternal life.
If you cling to life, you will die a thousand and one times. You will go
on... you will go on being born and dying again and again and again. It
is a wheel. If you cling, you move with the wheel.</p><p><br></p><p>Drop out of the wheel of life and death. How to drop out of it? It
seems so impossible because you have never thought of yourself as a
nonbeing, you have never thought of yourself as just space, pure space,
with nobody there inside.</p><p><br></p><p>These are the sutras. Each sutra has to be understood very deeply. A
sutra is a very condensed thing. A sutra is like a seed. You have to
accept it deep down in your heart; your heart has to become a soil for
it. Then it sprouts, and then the meaning.</p><p><br></p><p>I can only persuade you to be open so that the seed can fall right in
place within you, so that the seed can move into the deep darkness of
your nonbeing. In that darkness of your nonbeing, it will start being
alive. A sutra is a seed. Intellectually, it is very easy to understand
it. Existentially, to attain to its meaning is arduous. But that’s what
Patanjali would like, that’s what I would like.</p><p><br></p><p>So don’t just be intellectuals here. Get en rapport with me, get in
tune with me. Don’t just listen to me; rather, be with me. Listening is
secondary; being with me is primary, basic – just to be in my company.
Allow yourself to be totally here-now with me, in my presence, because
that death has happened to me. It can become infectious. I have
committed that suicide. If you come close to me, if you are in tune with
me even for a single moment, you will have a glimpse of death.</p><p><br></p><p>And, Buddha is right when he says, “If you can see death, death will
not be able to see you,” because the moment you see death you have
transcended death. Then there is no death for you.</p><p><br></p><p>The first sutra:</p><p><br></p><p>BY PERFORMING SAMYAMA ON THE TWO TYPES OF KARMA, ACTIVE AND DORMANT,
OR UPON OMENS AND PORTENTS, THE EXACT TIME OF DEATH CAN BE
PREDICTED.</p><p><br></p><p>Many things. First, why be worried about the exact time of death? How
is it going to help? What is the point of it? If you ask Western
psychologists, they will almost call it abnormal morbidity. Why be
concerned with death? Avoid. Go on believing that death is not going to
happen – at least not to you. It always happens to somebody else. You
have seen people die, you have never seen yourself die, so why be
afraid? You may be the exception. But nobody is an exception; and death
has already happened in your birth, so you cannot avoid it.</p><p><br></p><p>Now the birth is beyond your power. You cannot do anything about it;
it has already happened. It is already past; it is already done. You
cannot undo it. Death is yet to happen: something is possible to be done
about it.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole of Eastern religion depends on the vision of death, because
that is the possibility which is going to happen. If you know it
beforehand, tremendous is the possibility. Many doors open. Then</p><p>you can die in your own way, then you can die with a signature of
your own on your death. Then you can manage not to be born again – that
is the whole meaning. It is not morbid. It is very, very scientific.
When everybody is going to die, this is absolutely foolish not to think
about death, not to meditate upon death, not to focus upon it, not to
come to a deep understanding about it.</p><p><br></p><p>It is going to happen. If you know, much is possible.</p><p><br></p><p>Patanjali says even the exact date, the hour, the minute, the second
of death can be known beforehand. If you know exactly when death is
coming, you can prepare. Death has to be received like a great guest. It
is not the enemy. In fact it is a god given gift. It is a great
opportunity to pass through. It can become a breakthrough: if you can
die alert, conscious, aware, you will never be born again – and there
will be no death anymore. If you miss, you will be born again. If you go
on missing, you will be continuously born again and again, unless you
learn the lesson of death.</p><p><br></p><p>Let me say it in this way: the whole of life is nothing but a
learning about death, a preparation for death. That’s why death comes in
the end. It is the pinnacle, the crescendo, the very climax, the
peak.</p><p><br></p><p>In the West particularly, contemporary psychologists have become
aware that in a deep sex act a certain peak can be attained, a climax, a
great orgasm, which is tremendously fulfilling, exhilarating, ecstatic.
You are cleansed; you come out of it rejuvenated, fresh, again young,
again alive – all the dust gone, as if you have taken a great shower, an
energy shower. But they have not yet come to know that the sex act is a
very minor death; and one who can achieve deep orgasm is one who allows
himself to die in love. It is a minor death, nothing to be compared with
death. Death is the greatest orgasm there is.</p><p><br></p><p>The intensity of death is such that almost always people become
unconscious. They cannot face it. The moment death comes, you are so
afraid, so full of anxiety, to avoid you become unconscious. Almost
ninety-nine percent of people die unconsciously. They miss the
opportnity.</p><p><br></p><p>To know death beforehand is just a method to help you prepare so when
death comes you are perfectly alert and aware, waiting, ready to go with
death, ready to surrender, ready to embrace death. Once you have
accepted death in awareness, there is no longer any birth for you – you
have learned the lesson. Now there is no coming back to the school
again. This life is just a school, a discipline – a discipline to learn
death. It is not morbid.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole of religion is concerned with death, and if some religion
is not concerned with death, then it is not religion at all. It may be a
sociology, an ethics, a morality, a politics, but it cannot be religion.
Religion is the search of the deathless; but that deathless is possible
only through the door of death.</p><p><br></p><p>The first sutra says, “By performing samyama on the two types of
karma, active and dormant, or upon omens and portents, the exact time of
death can be predicted.” The Eastern analysis of karma says that there
are three types of karma. Let us understand them.</p><p><br></p><p>First is called sanchita. Sanchita means the total, the total of all
your past lives. Whatsoever you have done, howsoever you have reacted to
situations, whatsoever you have thought and desired, achieved, missed –
the total – the total of your doings, thinkings, feelings of all the
lives is called sanchita. Sanchita: the word means the all, the
accumulated all.</p><p>The second type of karma is known as prarabdha. The second type of
karma is that part of sanchita which you have to fulfill in this life,
which has to be worked out in this life. You have lived many lives; you
have accumulated much. Now a part of it will have the opportunity to be
acted out, realized, suffered, passed through in this life. Only a part
of it, because this life has a limitation – seventy, eighty, or a
hundred years. In a hundred years you cannot live all the past karmas –
the sanchita, the accumulated – only a part of it. That part is called
prarabdha.</p><p><br></p><p>Then there is a third type of karma which is known as kriyaman. That
is day today karma. First the accumulated whole, then a small portion of
it for this life, then even a smaller portion of it for today or for
this moment. Each moment there is an opportunity to do something or not
to do something. Somebody insults you: you become angry. You react, you
do something; or, if you are aware, you simply watch, you don’t become
angry. You simply remain a witness. You don’t do anything; you don’t
react. You remain cool and collected; you remain centered. The other has
not been able to disturb you.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are disturbed by the other and you react, then the kriyaman
karma falls into the deep reservoir of the sanchita. Then you are
accumulating again; then for future lives you are accumulating. If you
don’t react, then a past karma is fulfilled – you must have insulted
this man in some past life, now he has insulted you; the account is
closed. Finished. A man who is aware will feel happy that at least this
part is finished. He has become a little more free.</p><p><br></p><p>Somebody came and insulted Buddha. Buddha remained quiet, he listened
attentively, and then he said, “Thank you.” The man was very much
puzzled; he said, “Have you gone mad? I am insulting you, hurting you,
and you simply say thank you?” Buddha said, “Yes, because I was waiting
for you. I had insulted you in the past, and I was waiting – unless you
come I will not be totally free. Now you are the last man; my accounts
are closed. Thank you for coming. You might have waited, you might not
have come in this life, then I would have had to wait for you. And I
don’t say anything anymore, because enough is enough. I don’t want to
create another chain.”</p><p><br></p><p>Then the kriyaman karma, the day-to-day karma, does not fall into the
reservoir, does not add to it; in fact, the reservoir is a little less
than it was. The same is true about prarabdha – the whole life, this
life. If in this life you go on reacting, you are creating the reservoir
more and more. You will have to come again and again. You are creating
too many chains; you will be in bondage.</p><p><br></p><p>Try to understand the Eastern concept of freedom. In the West freedom
has a connotation of political freedom. In India we don’t bother much
about political freedom, because we say unless one is spiritually free,
it makes not much difference whether you are politically free or not.
The fundamental thing is to be spiritually free.</p><p><br></p><p>The bondage is created by the karmas. Whatsoever you do in
unawareness becomes a karma. Any action done in unawareness becomes a
karma because any action done in unawareness is not action at all; it is
a reaction. When you do something in full awareness it is not a
reaction; it is an action, spontaneous, total. It leaves no trace. It is
complete in itself; it is not incomplete. If it is incomplete then some
day or other it will have to be completed. So if in this life you remain
alert, then the prarabdha disappears and your reservoir becomes more and
more empty. In a few lives the reservoir becomes absolutely empty.</p><p>This sutra says, “By performing samyama on the two types of
karma.<span class=s4></span>” Patanjali means sanchita</p><p>and prarabdha because the kriyaman is nothing but a part of
prarabdha, so he divides in two.</p><p><br></p><p>What is samyama? That has to be understood. Samyama is the greatest
synthesis of human consciousness, the synthesis of three: dharana,
dhyan, samadhi.</p><p><br></p><p>Ordinarily, your mind is continuously jumping from one object to
another. Not for a single moment are you in tune with one object. You go
on jumping. Your mind goes on constantly moving; it is like a flux. This
moment something is in the focus of the mind, next moment something
else, next moment still something else. This is the ordinary state of
mind.</p><p><br></p><p>The first step out of it is dharana. Dharana means concentration –
fixing your whole consciousness on one object, not allowing the object
to disappear, bringing again and again your consciousness on the object
so that the unconscious habit of the mind of continuous flux can be
dropped; because once the habit of continuous change can be dropped, you
attain to an integrity, to a crystallization. When there are so many
objects moving continuously, you remain so many. Understand it. You
remain divided because your objects are divided.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, you love one woman today, another woman tomorrow,
another woman the third day. That will create a division in you. You
cannot be one; you will become many. You will become a crowd. Hence the
Eastern insistence to create a love in which you can remain for a longer
period, as long as possible. There have been experiments in the East in
which a couple has remained a couple for many lives together. Again and
again the same woman, the same man: that gives an integrity. Too much
change erodes your being, splits you. So if in the West the
schizophrenia is becoming almost a normal thing, it is not something to
be wondered at. It is not strange; it is natural. Everything is
changing.</p><p><br></p><p>I have heard that one film actress in Hollywood got married to her
eleventh husband. She came home, introduced the new dad to the children.
The children brought a register, and they said to the dad, “Please sign
it, because today you are here, tomorrow you may be gone; and we are
accumulating the signatures, autographs, of all our dads.”</p><p><br></p><p>You go on changing houses; you go on changing everything. In America
the average limit of a person’s job is three years. The job is also
continuously changing. The house – the average limit of a person staying
in one town is also three years. And the average limit of marriage is
also three years. Somehow three years seems to be very important. It
seems if you remain the fourth year with the same woman there is fear
that you may get settled. If you remain in the same job more than three
years there is fear that you may get settled. So people go on; they have
become almost vagabonds. That creates divisions inside you.</p><p><br></p><p>In the East we tried to give a job to a person as part of his life. A
man was born in a Brahmin house: he remained a Brahmin. That was a great
experiment to give stability. A man was born in a shoemaker’s house: he
remained a shoemaker. The marriage, the family, the job, the town –
people were born in the same town and they would die in the same town.
Lao Tzu remembers, “I have heard that in the ancient days people had not
gone beyond the river.” They had heard dogs barking on the other side,
the other shore. They had inferred that there must be a town because in
the evening they had seen smoke rising – people must be cooking. They
had heard dogs barking, but they had not bothered to go and see. People
were so harmoniously settled.</p><p>This constant change simply says that your mind is feverish. You
cannot stay longer at anything; then your whole life becomes a life of
continuous change – as if a tree is being uprooted again and again and
again and never gets the right time to send its roots deep down into the
earth. The tree will be alive only for the name’s sake. It will not be
able to bloom, not possible, because before flowers come, the roots have
to settle.</p><p><br></p><p>So, concentration means bringing your consciousness to one object and
becoming capable of retaining it there – any object. If you are looking
at a rose flower, you continuously look at it. Again and again the mind
wanders, goes here and there; you bring it back. You tame the mind – you
tame the bull. You bring it back to the rose. The mind goes again; you
bring it back. By and by, the mind starts being with the rose for longer
periods. Once your mind remains with the rose for a long period, you
will be able for the first time to know what a rose is. It is not just a
rose: God has flowered in it. The fragrance is not only of the rose; the
fragrance is divine. But you never were en rapport with it for long.</p><p><br></p><p>Sit with a tree and be with it. Sit with your boyfriend or girlfriend
and be with him or her, and bring yourself again and again. Otherwise,
what is happening? Even if you are making love to a woman, you are
thinking of something else – maybe moving in a totally different world.
Even in love you are not focused. You miss much. A door opens, but you
are not there to see it. You come back when the door is closed
again.</p><p><br></p><p>Each moment there are millions of opportunities to see God, but you
are not there. He comes and knocks at your doors, but you are not there.
You are never found there. You go on roaming around the world. This
roaming has to be stopped; that’s what is the meaning of dharana.
Dharana is the first step of the great synthesis of samyama.</p><p><br></p><p>The second step is dhyan. In dharana, in concentration, you bring
your mind to a focus: the object is important. You have to bring again
and again the object in your consciousness; you are not to lose track of
it. The object is important in dharana. The second step is dhyan,
meditation. In meditation the object is not important anymore; it
becomes secondary. Now, the flow of consciousness becomes important –
the very consciousness which is being poured on the object. Any object
will do, but your consciousness should be poured in a continuity; there
should not be gaps.</p><p><br></p><p>Have you watched? If you pour water from one pot to another, there
are gaps. If you pour oil from one pot to another, there are not gaps.
Oil has a continuity; water falls discontinuously. Dhyan means,
meditation means, your consciousness should be falling on any object of
concentration in a continuity. Otherwise it is flickering. It is
constantly flickering; it is not a continuous torch. Sometimes it is
there, then disappears; then again is there, then disappears; then again
is there. In dhyan you have to make it a continuity, an absolute
continuity.</p><p><br></p><p>When consciousness becomes continuous, you become tremendously
strong. For the first time you feel what life is. For the first time,
holes in your life disappear. For the first time you are together. Your
togetherness means the togetherness of consciousness. If your
consciousness is like drops of water and not a continuity, you cannot be
really there. Those gaps will be a disturbance. Your life will be very
dim and faint; it will not have strength, force, energy. When
consciousness flows in a continuous, riverlike phenomenon, you have
become a waterfall of energy.</p><p>This is the second step of samyama, the second ingredient; and then
is the third ingredient, the ultimate, that is samadhi. In dharana,
concentration, the object is important because you have to choose one
object amidst millions. In dhyan, meditation, consciousness is
important; you have to make consciousness a continuous flow. In samadhi
the subject is important: the subject has to be dropped.</p><p><br></p><p>You dropped many objects. When there were many objects, you were many
subjects, a crowd, a polypsychic existence – not one mind, many minds.
People come to me and they say, “I would like to take sannyas, but.…”
That “but” brings the second mind. They think they are the same, but the
“but” brings another mind. They are not one. They would like to do
something and, at the same time, they would not like to do it – two
minds. If you watch you will find many minds in you – almost a
marketplace.</p><p><br></p><p>When there are too many objects, there are too many minds
corresponding to them. When there is one object, one mind arises –
focused, centered, rooted, grounded. Now this one mind has to be
dropped; otherwise you will remain in the ego. The many has been
dropped; now drop the one also. In samadhi this one mind has to be
dropped. When one mind drops, the one object also disappears because it
cannot be there. They always are together.</p><p><br></p><p>In samadhi only consciousness remains, as pure space.</p><p><br></p><p>These three together are called samyama. Samyama is the greatest
synthesis of human consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>Now you will be able to understand the sutra: “By performing samyama
on the two types of karma, active and dormant, or upon omens and
portents, the exact time of death can be predicted.” Now if you
concentrate, meditate, and get in tune in samadhi, you can be capable of
knowing the exact time of death. If you move your samyama, this great
synthesis of consciousness, this great power that has arisen in you; if
you move it towards death, you will be able to know immediately when you
are going to die.</p><p><br></p><p>How it happens? When you go in a dark room, you cannot see what is
there. When you go with a light, you can see what is there, or what is
not there. You move almost in darkness your whole life, so you don’t
know how much prarabdha is still there – prarabdha, the karma that you
have to fulfill in this life. When you go with samyama, with light
burning bright, you bring the flame in; you know how much prarabdha is
left. You see the whole house is empty, just in the corner a few things
are left, soon they will disappear. Now you can see when you are going
to die.</p><p><br></p><p>It is said about Ramkrishna that he was much too interested in food;
in fact obsessed. That is very unlikely. Even his wife, Sharada, used to
feel very embarrassed; because he was such a great saint, only with one
flaw – and the flaw was that he was much too interested in food. He was
interested so much that while he was giving satsang to his disciples,
just in the middle he will say, “Wait, I am coming,” and he will go to
look into the kitchen, what is being cooked. He will just go there and
ask, “What is being prepared today?” and then will come back and start
his satsang again.</p><p><br></p><p>His closest disciples became worried. They said, “This doesn’t look
good, Paramhansa. And everything is so perfectly beautiful – never has
there walked such a beautiful and perfect man – but this small thing,
why can’t you drop it?” He will laugh and will not say anything.</p><p>One day his wife Sharada insisted too much. He said, “Okay, if you
insist, I will tell. My prarabdha is finished; and I am just clinging
with this food. If I drop that I am gone.”</p><p><br></p><p>The wife could not believe this. It is very difficult for wives to
believe in their own husbands – even if the husband is a Paramhansa it
makes no difference. The wife must have thought that he is befooling, or
he is trying to rationalize. Seeing that, Ramkrishna said, “Look, I can
see that you are not trusting me, but you will know. The day I am going
to die, just three days before that day, three days before my death, I
will not look at the food. You will bring my thali in, and I will start
looking in another direction; then you can know that only three days
more am I to be here.”</p><p><br></p><p>That too was not believed; they forgot about it. Then, just three
days before Ramkrishna died, he was resting, Sharada brought his thali,
his food: he turned over, started looking at the other side. Suddenly
the wife realized, remembered. The thali fell from her hands, she
started crying. Ramkrishna said, “Don’t cry now. Now my work is
finished; I need not cling.” And exactly after three days he died.</p><p><br></p><p>He was clinging in compassion, just trying to create a bondage with
one chain. The imprisonment is gone; the prison has disappeared. Out of
compassion he was trying to cling, to linger a little longer on this
shore, to help those who had gathered around him. But it is difficult to
understand a Paramhansa. It is difficult to understand a man who has
become a siddha, a Buddha, one who has emptied all his sanchita, all
accumulated karmas. It is very difficult. He has no gravitation, so
Ramkrishna was clinging to a rock. The rock has gravitation. He was
clinging to a rock so that he could linger on this earth a little
longer.</p><p><br></p><p>When you have samyama, a consciousness fully alert, you can see how
much karma is left. It is exactly like when a physician comes and he
sees and touches the pulse of a dying man, and he says, “Not more than
two, three hours.” What is he saying? By long experience he has come to
know how the pulse beats when a person is going to die. Exactly that
way, a man who is alert knows how much prarabdha is left – how much
pulse – and he knows when he has to go.</p><p><br></p><p>This can be done in two ways. The sutra says either to focus on
death, that is prarabdha karma.… “By performing samyama on the two types
of karma, active and dormant, or upon omens and portents, the exact time
of death can be predicted.” This can be done in two ways: either you
look at the prarabdha or there are a few omens and portents which can be
watched.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, before one person dies, almost exactly near about nine
months before, something happens. Ordinarily we are not aware, because
we are not aware at all, and the phenomenon is very subtle. I say almost
nine months because it differs. It depends: the time between the
conception and the birth will be the time. If you were born after nine
months being in the womb, then nine months. If you were born after being
ten months in the womb, then ten months. If you were born after seven
months in the womb, then seven months. It depends on the amount of time
between the time of conception and birth. Exactly the same time before
death, something clicks in the hara, in the navel center. It has to
click because between the conception and birth there was a gap of nine
months: nine months you took for birth; exactly the same time will be
taken for death. As you prepared nine months in the mother’s womb for
birth, you will have to prepare nine months to die. Then the circle will
be complete. Something in the navel center happens. Those who are aware,
they will immediately know that something has broken in the navel
center; now death is coming closer. Approximately nine months.</p><p>Or for example, there are other omens and other portents. A man,
before he dies, exactly six months before he dies, becomes by and by
incapable of seeing the tip of his own nose because eyes start turning
upwards, very slowly. In death they turn completely upwards, but they
start the turning, the returning journey, before death. That happens:
when a child is born, the child takes almost six months, that is usually
– there may be exceptions – the child takes six months to have fixed
eyes. Otherwise the eyes are loose. That’s why children can bring both
their eyes together near the nose, can take them far away to the corners
very easily. Their eyes are still loose. The day a child’s eyes become
fixed: if that day comes after six months or nine months or ten or
twelve months, then exactly the same will be the time; again the eyes
will start becoming loose and moving upwards. That’s why in India
villagers say – they must have come to know from yogis – that before a
man dies he becomes incapable of seeing the tip of his own nose.</p><p><br></p><p>And there are many methods in which yogis continuously watch the tip
of their nose. They concentrate on it. People who have been
concentrating on it, suddenly one day realize they cannot see their own
nose. Now they know the death is approaching near.</p><p><br></p><p>According to yoga physiology there are seven centers in man. The
first, the genital organs; and the last is sahasrar, in the head;
between these two there are five others. Whenever you die, you die from
a particular center. That shows your growth that you have been doing in
this life. Ordinarily, people die through the genital organ, because the
whole life people live around the sex center, continuously thinking of
sex, fantasizing about sex, doing everything about sex – as if the whole
of life seems to be centered around the sex center. These people die
through the sex center. If you have evolved a little and you have
attained to love, gone beyond sex, then you will die from the heart
center. If you have evolved completely, if you have become a siddha, you
will die from the sahasrar.</p><p><br></p><p>The center you will die from will have an opening because the whole
life energy will be released from there.…</p><p><br></p><p>Just a few days before, Vipassana died. Her brother Viyogi was asked
to hit her head; that has become symbolic in India. When a person dies
and is put on the funeral pyre, the head has to be hit. Just symbolic,
because if the person has attained to the ultimate, then the head will
break on its own; but the person has not attained. But we hope and pray,
and break the skull.</p><p><br></p><p>The point of release becomes open. This point can be seen. Some day
or other, when Western medical science will become aware of yoga
physiology, this also will become part of all postmortems – how the
person died. Just now they see only whether he died naturally or was
poisoned or killed or committed suicide – all ordinary things. The most
basic thing they miss, which has to be there on the report – how the
person died: from the sex center, from the heart center, or from
sahasrar – from where he died. And there is a possibility – and yogis
have done much work on it – it can be seen in the body because that
particular center breaks, as if an egg has broken and something has gone
out of it.</p><p><br></p><p>When somebody who has attained to samyama becomes, just three days
before he dies, aware from what center he is going to move, almost
always he moves from sahasrar. A certain activity, a movement, just at
the top of the head starts working three days before one dies.</p><p><br></p><p>These indications can prepare you how to receive death, and if you
know how to receive death in a great celebration, in great joy, in
delight – almost dancing and in ecstasy – you will not be born</p><p>again. Your lesson is complete. You have learned whatsoever was to be
learned here on this earth; now you are ready to move beyond for a
greater mission, for a greater life, for more unlimited life. Now you
are ready to be absorbed by the cosmos, by the whole. You have earned
it.</p><p><br></p><p>One thing more about this sutra. The kriyaman karma, the day to-day
karma, is just a very small fragment; in modern psychological terms we
can call it the “conscious.” Below it is prarabdha; in modern
psychological terms we can call it the “subconscious.” Even below that
is sanchita; in modern psychological terms we can call it the
“unconscious.”</p><p><br></p><p>Ordinarily, you are not aware of your day to-day activities, so how
can you be aware of prarabdha or sanchita? Impossible. So start by
becoming aware of day-to-day activities. Walking on the road, be alert.
Eating your food, be alert. Remain watchful of what you are doing.
Remain with the activity. Don’t go here and there. Don’t do things like
a zombie. Don’t move as if you are in deep hypnosis. Whatsoever you are
saying, say everything fully alert, so that you are not going to repent
ever.</p><p><br></p><p>When you say, “I am sorry. I said something which I never wanted to
say,” that simply shows you were asleep, not aware. When you say, “I did
something, I don’t know why and how. I don’t know how it happened. I
have done it in spite of myself,” then remember, you worked asleep. You
are a somnambulist walking in sleep.</p><p><br></p><p>Make yourself more and more alert. That is the meaning of being
here-now. Right now you are listening to me: you can be just the ears.
Right now you are seeing me: you can be just the eyes, fully alert, not
even a thought passing through your mind, no disturbance, no cloudiness
inside. Just focused on me – totally listening, totally seeing – being
with me herenow: that is the first step.</p><p><br></p><p>If you attain to that, the second step becomes available; then you
can move into the subconscious. Then when somebody insults you, you will
not become aware only when you become angry. You will become aware
immediately somebody has insulted – there, a certain anger has moved
into the subconscious depth of your being, just a small wave, very
subtle. If you are not very sensitive and aware, you will not know it –
unless it erupts into the conscious you will not know it. By and by you
will become aware of subtle nuances, subtle shades of emotions – that is
prarabdha, the subconscious.</p><p><br></p><p>When you become aware of the subconscious, another step will become
available to you. The more you grow, the more growth becomes possible to
you. You will be able to see, now, the third step, the final step, of
becoming aware of sanchita, the accumulated past. Once you move into the
unconscious – that means you are taking the light of consciousness into
the deepest core of your being – you will become enlightened. That is
the meaning of becoming a Buddha – nothing is in the dark now. Every
nook and corner is lighted. Then you live, you act, but you don’t
accumulate any karma.</p><p><br></p><p>The second sutra:</p><p><br></p><p>BY PERFORMING SAMYAMA ON FRIENDLINESS, OR ANY OTHER ATTRIBUTE, GREAT
STRENGTH IN THAT QUALITY IS OBTAINED.</p><p><br></p><p>First one has to become aware, and immediately the second step is: to
bring your samyama on the feeling of friendliness. Love, compassion.</p><p>Let me tell you one story:</p><p><br></p><p>It happened, a great Buddhist monk, Tamino was his name, persevered,
worked hard, and entered the state of satori – the state of samyama. And
there he was aware of nothing.…</p><p><br></p><p>When you are really aware, you are not aware of anything. You are
only aware of awareness. That too is not good to say, because then
awareness looks like an object. No, you are simply aware of nothing –
just aware.</p><p><br></p><p>... And there he was aware of nothing, and his soul was like nothing.
And this state was beyond even peace, and he would have been glad to
remain in it forever.…</p><p><br></p><p>Remember it, when one attains to samyama, one would like to remain
forever in it, one would not like to go out of it – but this is not the
end of the journey. This is only half the journey. Unless your samadhi
becomes love, unless you bring whatsoever you have found within you to
the greater world, unless you share your samadhi with others, you are
proving yourself a miser. Samadhi is not the goal; love is the goal. So
whenever it will happen to you, any of you, you will also come to a
point when one wants not to move out. It is so beautiful, it is so
tremendously blissful, who bothers?</p><p><br></p><p>... And this stage was beyond even peace, and he would have been glad
to remain in it forever. But as it happened, on that day he had gone out
to meditate in the little wood that surrounded his monastery. And as he
sat there by the way, lost in meditation, there passed a traveller, and
thieves leapt upon him and wounded and robbed him and left him for dead.
He cried for aid to Tamino, but Tamino sat there unconscious, seeing and
hearing nothing.…</p><p><br></p><p>Tamino was sitting there, and the man was dying there, and the man
was calling for help; but he was so deep within himself that nothing
reached him. He could not hear. He could not see – the eyes were open,
but he was not there in the eyes. He has gone to the very rock bottom of
his being. Just the body was breathing, but he was not there on the
periphery.</p><p><br></p><p>And so the man lay bleeding on the ground, and there he was when
Tamino returned to earth – came back to his body, came back to his
senses. Tamino was dazed and for a long time did not understand what he
saw nor knew what he had to do.…</p><p><br></p><p>It takes a little time to put yourself together again on the
periphery. The center is so totally different. You move almost in an
absolutely unknown territory. And when you come back it is difficult to
again get in tune with the periphery. It is almost like people who have
been to the moon: when they come back, for three weeks they have to be
put in a special house prepared for them – to get ready again to move on
the earth. If immediately after coming back from the moon they go to
their home, they will get crazy or mad; because the moon is so
different. The gravitation is not much there – one eighth of the earth.
One can just jump sixty feet, seventy feet, easily. One can jump on
anybody’s terrace, no problem. The gravitation is almost nil. And the
moon is so empty, one is dazed. And the silence is so tremendous,
uninterrupted for millions of years – so heavy – that when one comes
back from the moon, one is coming as if after one has died and is again
coming back to the earth.</p><p><br></p><p>When the first man walked on the moon, he was not a theist, but
suddenly he fell on his knees and started praying. The first thing that
has been done on the moon is prayer. What happened to him?</p><p>The silence was such, it was so deep, and he was so alone, suddenly
he remembered God. In that loneliness, in that aloneness, in that
solitude, he forgot all about that he didn’t believe in God, that he is
a skeptical mind, that he is a doubter. He forgot all. He immediately
fell down and started praying.</p><p><br></p><p>When one comes from the moon, he has to be reacclimatized to the
earth; but this is nothing compared to when you go to the center of your
being and come back.</p><p><br></p><p>... Tamino was dazed and for a long time did not understand what he
saw nor knew what he had to do. But presently, as the current of his
life in the flesh set in again, he went up to the man and bound up his
wounds as best he could. But the man’s blood had flowed too long. He
looked at Tamino and died – and those eyes Tamino could not forget; and
those eyes haunted him; and he was so much disturbed – the whole satori
lost – he forgot all about the center. He was puzzled.</p><p><br></p><p>And in his eyes, before he died, Tamino saw the look he had seen once
on the battlefield; and all his peace, so painfully won, fled from him.
He went back to the monastery and passed over onto the island and
mounted to the topmost terrace, and there sat down beside one of the
images of Gautam Buddha. It was evening, and the setting sun alone shone
on the stone face, till it seemed to flush into life.</p><p><br></p><p>Tamino looked into the eyes of the face and said, “Lord Buddha, was
your gospel true?” And the image answered back, “True and false.”</p><p>“What was true in it?” asked Tamino. “Compassion and love.”</p><p>“And what was false in it?” “Flight from life, escape.” “Must I go
back to life?”</p><p>But the light had faded from the face and it turned to stone
again.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a beautiful story. Yes, Tamino had to come back to life. One
has to come back to love from samadhi; hence, Patanjali’s sutra
immediately after the samadhi, in which death is experienced: “By
performing samyama on friendliness, or any other attribute,” compassion,
love, “great strength in that quality is obtained.”</p><p><br></p><p>Contemporary psychologists will also agree – up to a certain limit.
If you constantly think about something, it starts materializing. You
must have heard the name of Emile Coue, or if you have not heard the
name you must have heard his slogan: Every day, in every way, I am
getting better and better. He treated thousands of patients – in great
trouble, people in great trouble – and he helped them tremendously. And
this was his only medicine. He will just say to them, “Repeat: every
day, in every way, I am getting better and better. Just repeat it, just
feel it, just surround yourself with this idea ‘I am getting better,
healthier, happier.’” And thousands of people were helped; they came</p><p>out of their illnesses. They came out of their mental diseases. They
came out of their troubles and anxieties. They thrived again, they
became alive again, and there was nothing in it – just a small
mantra.</p><p><br></p><p>But what happens: you create the world you live in. You create the
body also you live in; you create the mind also you live in. You create
with your ideas. Whatsoever you think sooner or later becomes a reality.
Every thought becomes a thing finally, eventually.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is so with such an ordinary mind, which goes on changing the
object every moment, goes on jumping from here and there; what to think
about samyama? When there is no mind and just the idea of friendliness
arises, one becomes so en rapport with it, one becomes it.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha has said, “The next time I come into the world, my name will
be Maitreya, ‘the friend.’” It is very symbolic – whether he is coming
or not, that is not the point. But it is very symbolic. He is saying
that after becoming a Buddha, one has to become the friend.</p><p><br></p><p>After one has attained to samadhi, one has to attain to compassion.
Compassion is the criterion whether your samadhi is true or not.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember, don’t be a miser; because habits persist. If in the outside
world you are a miser and you cling to things, to money and this and
that; when samadhi arises in you, you will cling to samadhi. The
clinging will continue – and the clinging has to be dropped. Hence,
immediately, after death, when you start feeling the deathless,
Patanjali says bring friendliness in, now think of sharing.</p><p><br></p><p>There are two seas in Palestine. One is filled with fresh and
sparkling water. Trees and flowers grow around it. Fish live in it, and
its banks are green. The pure waters of this sea, which possess a
healing quality, are brought down by the River Jordan from the hills
around Mount Hermon...</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus loved this river; Jesus loved this sea. Many miracles happened
around this place with him.</p><p><br></p><p>... The Master loved this sea, and many of the happier moments of his
ministry were spent beside it. It is a place filled to this day with
serenity and power.</p><p><br></p><p>The River Jordan flows on south into another sea. Here there is no
life, no song of birds, no children’s laughter. The air hangs sinister
and heavy above its water, and neither man nor beast nor bird will
drink. This sea is dead.</p><p><br></p><p>What makes so mighty a difference between these two seas of Palestine
– one so alive, so tremendously alive; and another so dead, so deadly
dead?</p><p><br></p><p>This is the difference: the Sea of Galilee receives but does not keep
the waters of River Jordan. For every drop that flows into it, another
drop flows out. The more it gives joyfully away, the more it receives in
return. This is the sea of life – the Sea of Galilee.</p><p><br></p><p>The other sea hoards every drop of water reaching it and gives
nothing in return. The Sea of Galilee gives and lives. The other sea
gives nothing and does not live. It is truly named “The Dead” – the Dead
Sea.</p><p>And the same is true about human life. You can become the Sea of
Galilee or you can become the Dead Sea. If you become the Sea of
Galilee, sooner or later you will attract the consciousness of Jesus to
you. The Master will walk around you again. Again he will be seen with
his disciples near you; again you will be in a totally different world.
You will have the touch of the divine. Or you can become the Dead Sea;
then go on receiving and don’t give; then go on hoarding and don’t give.
How did it become dead? A miser is a dead person; a miser dies every
day. Share, whatsoever you have share, and you will receive more. That
is the meaning of friendliness.</p><p><br></p><p>And Patanjali says bring your samyama to compassion, love, and
friendliness; and they will grow. Not that you will become friendly: you
will become the friend. Not that you will become friendly: you will
become friendship, friendliness. Not that you will love: you will become
love, you will be the very quality of love.</p><p><br></p><p>The third sutra:</p><p><br></p><p>BY PERFORMING SAMYAMA ON THE STRENGTH OF AN ELEPHANT, THE STRENGTH OF
AN ELEPHANT IS OBTAINED.</p><p><br></p><p>Whatsoever you want, you bring your samyama to it and it will happen
– because you are infinite. Whatsoever form you want to take you can
take after samyama. All miracles are possible; it depends on you. If you
want to become so powerful like an elephant, you can become. Just by
keeping the idea as a seed inside you and showering it with samyama, you
will become that. Because of this sutra, many people have done many
wrong things. This is a key, but if you want to become something
devilish, you can become. You can misuse yoga as much as you can misuse
science. Science has released the atomic energy. Now you can use it by
dropping it on cities and killing people. You can create more Hiroshimas
and Nagasakis – you can make the whole earth a dead, burned place, a
cemetery.</p><p><br></p><p>The same atomic energy can be used creatively. All the poverty that
exists on earth can disappear within minutes. All the food that is
needed can be created, and all the luxuries that are available only to a
very few can become part of the normal life of everybody. Nobody is
barring the path, but somehow man does not have that creative
understanding.</p><p><br></p><p>Yoga has been misused in the same way.</p><p><br></p><p>All knowledge brings power, and power can be used positively or
negatively. I have heard an anecdote:</p><p>A drunk shuffled up to a rich banker and asked for sixpence for a cup
of coffee. Being an extremely generous man, the banker handed him a
ten-shilling note.</p><p><br></p><p>“Here,” he said, “you can buy yourself twenty cups of coffee with
that.” Next evening the banker saw the drunken tramp again.</p><p>“How are you today?” he asked cheerfully.</p><p>The tramp glared at him. “Why don’t you get lost,” he said rudely.
“You and your twenty cups of coffee. They kept me awake all last
night.”</p><p><br></p><p>It depends. A blessing can become a curse. What Patanjali is saying
is pure white magic; it is a magical formula. You can make it into a
devilish black magic. Then you will be destructive to others – and
destructive to yourself. Remember that. That’s why first he says become
friendly; then he talks about power.</p><p><br></p><p>People like Patanjali are so cautious. They have to be cautious
because of you. They watch their every step. First he tells how to
attain to samyama; immediately he talks about compassion and
friendliness; then he talks about power. Because when you have
compassion then power cannot be misused.</p><p><br></p><p>BY DIRECTING THE LIGHT OF THE SUPERPHYSICAL FACULTY, KNOWLEDGE IS
GAINED OF THE SUBTLE, THE HIDDEN, AND THE DISTANT.</p><p><br></p><p>Every dimension becomes available – “of the subtle, the hidden, the
distant” – once you know how not to be. Once you know how to be without
any ego, once you know how to be a pure consciousness with no subject
and no object, everything becomes possible. You can know all. By knowing
one all is known.</p><p><br></p><p>BY PERFORMING SAMYAMA ON THE SUN, KNOWLEDGE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM IS
GAINED.</p><p><br></p><p>This sutra is a little complicated – not in itself, but because of
the commentators. All the commentators of Patanjali talk about this
sutra as if Patanjali is talking about the sun out there. He is not
talking about that sun; he cannot talk about that. He is not an
astrologer, and he is not interested in astrology. He is interested in
man. He is interested in mapping man’s consciousness. And the sun is not
of the out.</p><p><br></p><p>In yoga terminology man is a microcosm. Man is in a subtle way a
small universe, condensed into a small existence. The existence, the
whole existence, is nothing hut man expanded. This is yoga terminology:
microcosm and macrocosm. Whatsoever exists outside also exists exactly
inside man.</p><p><br></p><p>Just like the sun, man has a sun inside; and just like the moon, man
has a moon inside. And Patanjali is interested in giving you the whole
geography of the inner world, of inner man. So when he says, “Bhuwan
gyanam surya samyamat” – “By performing samyama on the sun, knowledge of
the solar system is gained,” he does not mean the sun that is without.
He means the sun that is within.</p><p><br></p><p>Where is your inner sun? Where is your center of the inner solar
system? It is exactly hidden deep in the reproductive system. That’s why
sex is hot; it is a sort of heat. We have the expression for animals:
whenever a female is ready to be impregnated, we say she is in heat.
That phrase is exactly accurate. The sex center is the sun. That’s why
sex makes you hot and feverish. When you move in a sex act, you become
hotter and hotter and hotter. You touch an almost feverish peak; you
perspire; your breathing is disturbed. And after it you feel exhausted.
Then you fall into sleep.</p><p>When sex is exhausted, immediately the moon starts functioning. When
the sun sets the moon comes up. That’s why after the sex act you
immediately fall into sleep. The function of the sun is gone; the
function of the moon starts.</p><p><br></p><p>Sun is the sex center. By performing samyama on it, you will be able
to know the whole solar system inside. By performing samyama on the sex
center you will become capable of going beyond it. You will know all the
secrets of it; but it has nothing to do with the outer sun.</p><p><br></p><p>But if you know the inner sun, by reflection you can understand the
outer sun also. This sun is the sex center of the solar system. That’s
why everything alive needs sun. Trees go higher and higher. In Africa
they go higher than anywhere else because the forests are so dense and
there is much competition; because if you don’t go high you will die.
You will not be able to reach to the sun. You will not be available to
the sun and the sun will not be available to you. You will not be
showered by the energy of life.</p><p><br></p><p>Sun is life; sex is life. All life arises out of sun; all life arises
out of sex. All life.</p><p><br></p><p>Trees try to reach higher so that they can become available to the
sun and the sun becomes available to them. Just watch. The same trees
are on this side. These pine-type trees, the same trees are on this side
– they have remained small. This side they are throbbing high. Sun is
more available on this side; on that side sun is not available.</p><p><br></p><p>Sex is the inside sun; the sun is the sex organ of the solar system.
By reflection you will be able to understand the outer solar system
also, but the basic thing is to understand the inner solar system. So I
will insist on this, remember, that Patanjali is mapping the inner
ground. And of course it can be started only from the sun because sun is
the center. Not the goal, but the center. Not the ultimate, but the
center. One has to rise above it, one has to move above it, but it is
the beginning. It is not the omega, but it is the alpha.</p><p><br></p><p>Once Patanjali has said how to attain to samyama, how to transform
into compassion, love, and friendship, how to become powerful for
compassion, for love; he comes to the inner territory, the inner
topography: “By performing samyama on the sun, knowledge of the solar
system is gained.”</p><p><br></p><p>The whole world can be divided between two types of people: the sun
people and the moon people, or you can call them yang and yin. The sun
is the male; the moon is the female. The sun is aggression, the
positive; the moon is receptive, the passive. You can divide the whole
existence between sun and moon. And you can divide your body also
between sun and moon; yoga has divided.</p><p><br></p><p>It has divided so minutely that it has divided even your breath, your
breathing. One nostril is sun breath, another is moon breath. If you
become angry you will breathe from the sun side. If you want to become
silent, you will breathe from the moon side. The whole body is divided:
one of your sides is male, another side is female. The mind is divided:
one part of the mind is male, another part of the mind is female.</p><p><br></p><p>And one has to move from the sun towards the moon, and then beyond
both.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=_index>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

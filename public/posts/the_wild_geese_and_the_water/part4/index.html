I USED TO THINK THAT CLARITY, WIT AND ANALYSIS WAS THE WAY, BUT THEY ARE ALL GARBAGE ALONGSIDE HUGGING.\nPREM AMIDA,\nMAN NEEDS TO BE NEEDED. It is one of the most fundamental needs of human beings. Unless one is cared for one starts dying. Unless one feels that he is significant to somebody, at least to somebody, his whole life becomes insignificant.\nHence love is the greatest therapy there is. The world needs therapy because the world is missing love. In a really loving world no therapy will be needed at all; love will be enough, more than enough. Hugging is only a gesture of love, of warmth, of caring. the very feel of the warmth flowing from the other person melts many illnesses in you, melts the ice-like, cold ego. It makes you again a child.\nThe psychologists are well aware of the fact now that unless a child is hugged, kissed, he misses some nourishment. Just as the body needs food, the soul needs love. You can give to the child all\nthe physical needs, all the physical comforts, but if hugging is missing the child will not grow in a wholesome being. He will remain somewhere deep down sad, uncared for, neglected, ignored. He was nursed, but he was not mothered.\nIt has been observed that if a child is not hugged he starts shrinking – he can even die – although everything else was provided for. As far as the body is concerned every care was taken, but no love surrounded the child. He became isolated, he became disconnected with existence.\nLove is our connection, love is our very root. Just as you breathe – for the body it is absolutely essential: stop breathing and you are no more – in the same way, love is the inner breath. The soul lives by loving.\nAnalysis won’t do it. Wit and clarity, knowledge and scholarship won’t do it. You can know all there is to know about therapy, you can become an expert, but if you don’t know the art of love you remain only on the surface of the miracle of therapy.\nThe moment you start feeling for the patient, for the one who is suffering... out of hundred cases, ninety people are suffering basically because they have not been loved. If you start feeling the need for love of the patient, and if you can fulfill the need, there will be almost a magical change in the condition of the patient.\nLove is certainly the most therapeutic phenomenon. Sigmund Freud was very much afraid of it, so much so... hugging was beyond the question – he was not even ready to face the patient, because listening to his misery, listening to his inner nightmares, he may start feeling sympathetic. His eyes may become wet, tears may start flowing, or maybe in an unguarded moment he may hold the hand of the patient.\nHe was so much afraid of any loving relationship between the therapist and the patient that he created a certain device: the patient has to lie down on the couch and behind the couch the psychoanalyst has to sit, so they are not facing each other.\nAnd remember one thing: it is by facing each other that love grows. Animals cannot grow love because they make love to each other without facing each other, so there is no friendship, no relatedness. Once they are finished with lovemaking they go their ways – separately, not even saying a thankyou, or goodbye, or see you soon! Animals have not been able to create friendship, family, society, for the simple reason because when they are making love they are not looking into each other’s eyes, they are not looking into each other’s face; as if their lovemaking is almost mechanical; there is no human element in it.\nMan created the whole dimension of all kinds of relationships for the simple reason because he is the only animal who makes love facing each other. Then eyes start communicating, then facial expressions become a subtle language. Then the changes of mood and emotions – the joy, the ecstasy, the orgasmic glow – and intimacy grows. Intimacy needs it; it is a basic requirement.\nHence it is good to make love in light, not in darkness – at least a dim light, a candle light. Making love in darkness is just something animal in us, avoiding to face each other... a strategy to avoid.\nSigmund Freud was very much afraid of love; he was afraid of his own repressed love. He was afraid that he may get into some entanglement, involvement. He wanted to be just outside, not to be involved with the person, not to become part of his interiority, not to enter into deep waters but just to remain a scientific observer, aloof, detached, cool, far away. He wanted to create psychoanalysis as if it is a science. It is not a science, and it is never going to be a science! It is an art, and it is far more closer to love than to logic.\nAnd the real psychoanalyst will not avoid getting deep into the interiority of the patient – he will take the risk. It is risky, it is going into troubled waters. You may be drowned yourself – after all, you are also human! You may get into some trouble, complexity; you may create some problems for yourself, but that risk has to be taken.\nThat’s why I love Wilhelm Reich very much. He is the man who transformed the face of whole psychoanalysis – by getting involved with the patient. He discarded the couch, he discarded this detached aloofness. He is a far greater revolutionary than Sigmund Freud. Sigmund Freud remained traditional; he was really afraid of his own repressions.\nIf you are not afraid of your own repressions you can help tremendously. If you are not afraid of your own unconscious, if you have solved your problems a little bit, you can help greatly by getting involved into the world of the patient, by becoming a participant rather than remaining just an observer.\nIn fact, because psychoanalysts are having their own problems, sometimes even more than the patient himself, one can understand Sigmund Freud’s fear. As far as I am concerned, I would like to make a categorical statement about it: unless a person is really awakened, enlightened, he cannot be a real, authentic therapist. Only a Buddha can be a real therapist because he has no problems left. He can merge and melt into the patient; in fact, for him the patient is not the patient at all.\nThat’s the difference between the relationship that exists between a patient and his therapist and the relationship that exists between a disciple and a Master. The disciple is not a patient, the disciple is a beloved, a loved one. The Master is not just an observer, he has become a participant. They have lost their separate entities, they have become one, and that oneness helps.\nHugging is only a gesture of oneness – even the gesture helps. Prem Amida, you are right. You ask: WHY IS HUGGING SUCH AN INCREDIBLY EFFECTIVE THERAPEUTIC TOOL?\nIt is, and it is only a gesture. If it is true – not only a gesture but your heart is also in it – it can be a magical tool, it can be a miracle. It can transform the whole situation instantly.\nFew things have to be understood about it. One is: the idea that the child dies and the man becomes adolescent, then the adolescent dies and the man becomes young, then the young man dies and he becomes middle-aged, and so on, so forth, is wrong. The child never dies – nothing ever dies. The child is there, always is there, wrapped by other experiences – wrapped by adolescence, then by youth, then by middle age, then by old age – but the child is always there.\nYou are just like an onion, layers upon layers, but if you peel the onion soon you will find fresher layers inside. Go on deeper and you find more and more, fresher layers. The same is true about\nman: if you go deep into him you will always find the innocent child – and to contact that innocent child is therapeutic.\nHugging gives you an immediate contact with the child. If you hug somebody with warmth, love, if it is not just an impotent gesture, if it is meaningful, significant, true, if your heart is flowing through it, immediately you come in contact with the child, with the innocent child. And the innocent child even for a single moment surfacing makes a tremendous difference because the innocence of the child is always healthy and whole; it is uncorrupted. You have reached to the innermost core of the person where no corruption has ever entered, you have reached to the virgin core, and just making the virgin core throb again with life is enough. You have started, triggered a process of healing.\nHence all the religions have used this phenomenon in different ways. Whenever Jesus prays to God he always calls him ABBA. Christians have translated it as “God the Father”; that translation is not right, is very inaccurate – in a way literally true, but the metaphor has changed. ABBA can only be translated as “daddy”, not as “father”; “father” seems to be cold. Just repeat the word father and it looks so far away. “God the Father”... Looks like an institution! Father is really an institution, it is not a natural phenomenon. The mother is natural, the father is only a creation of a certain society. There have been societies before where father never existed.\nThe word uncle is far more older than the word father. In a matriarchal society people knew about the mother, but because the marriage has not come into existence yet no child knew about the father. So all the people who have been the lovers of the mother – somebody out of them must be the father but that is not known – so all the people who could have been the lovers were known as uncles.\nIn Talmud, the Jewish God says: “Remember, I am not nice, I am not your uncle!” The uncle is always nice, the father almost never. It is very difficult to be friendly with the father, it is very easy to be friendly with the uncle. I would rather say it is better to call “God the Uncle” than to call him “God the Father”. It is closer, nicer, more friendly. But to call him ABBA is the best. Jesus is giving him a name which creates intimacy.\nWhen you call God ABBA – Daddy – you are saying, “I am just a child. Take care of me, don’t ignore me. I cannot live without you – you are my life. Your love is my very nourishment.”\nAll the religions have used the idea that unless a man becomes a child again he cannot be truly religious. But to be a child means to be innocent, means to be full of wonder, means to be full of awe. For the child everything is a mystery – everything. He has no answers, he has only questions. He is immensely interested in knowing, he is open. The moment you have an answer you become closed, to that extent. If you have all the answers for all the questions you are absolutely closed, then you are not open. Your enquiry is finished, and with the enquiry finished you are dead.\nA real being is always enquiring, he is always on the pilgrimage. He remains always an agnostic. All children are agnostics, neither theists nor atheists, nor Hindus nor Mohammedans, nor Catholics nor Protestants. They are simply innocent! They don’t believe in anything but they are ready to enquire, to investigate. And the enquiring heart is a healthy heart. When you are loaded with beliefs you are ill.\nThe Christian is ill, the Hindu is ill, the Jaina is ill – ill because they are prejudiced, ill because without seeing they have believed, ill because they are behaving stupidly. How can you believe in something that you have not known! And when you know something there is no need to believe at all, so belief in any case is ridiculous. Either you know or you don’t know. If you know there is no need to believe; if you don’t know, how can you believe? So belief is only for the mediocres, the stupids, the idiots. And no child is an idiot. Every child is so fresh, so alive, so full of zest that his very aliveness makes him healthy.\nIf you can touch the child in the patient in any way... and hugging is simply one of the most important things.\nBecause I have allowed my sannyasins to hug and kiss I am condemned all over the country – that I am telling my people to be indulgent. If this is indulgence, then let it be indulgence. This is not indulgence at all; there is something more in it. I am telling to you to be loving, and just sitting with somebody and telling him again and again, “I love you,” is not enough. At least hold the hand! Make it a reality – hug the person.\nA very shy Englishman... and he must be very shy, otherwise just to be an Englishman is enough; there is no need to use the adjective “shy”. They are all shy! They are the most perfect gentlemen in the world – and, of course, in the same proportion they are dead too! Who has ever heard about a gentleman who is alive? If you are alive you are a man, why gentle? For what? Corpses are always gentle: they cannot do any harm, and they look so polite, so humble!\nThis shy gentleman was seeing a young woman for months. One full-moon night they were sitting together in the porch, looking in the garden, and beyond the garden the moon was rising. And the shy Englishman gathered courage; it must have been a real great mighty effort! My own feeling is it must be because of the moon; the moon drives people crazy, hence the word “lunatic”. Lunatic means “struck by the moon”. Lunatic comes from “lunar”, the moon – the moonstruck. He must have gone lunatic.\nHe asked the lady, “Can I..can I kiss you?”\nAnd the lady was really getting tired, so she said, “And what do you think? Am I waiting here for a bus?”\nWhen you love a person just verbal expressions are not enough, words are not enough; something more substantial is needed; words are only abstract. You have to do something! Hold the hand, hug the person, kiss the person, embrace the person. It is going to help you both: if you can melt in the hug you both will become again younger, fresher, livelier. And that’s the whole process of healing.\nPrem Amida, analysis is the way of the mind, hugging is the way of the heart. The mind is the cause of all diseases and the heart is the source of all healing.\nThe second question:\nQuestion 2\nOSHO,\nI HAVE A LOT OF FANTASIES, ESPECIALLY SEXUAL ONES. EVEN THOUGH I SEE HOW THEY ARE TAKING ME AWAY FROM LIFE HERE AND NOW, I LET MYSELF BE DOMINATED BY THEM. ACCORDING TO ASTROLOGY, A SCORPIO HAS ESPECIALLY STRONG SEXUAL DESIRES. I AM A SCORPIO.\nHAVE MY FANTASIES ANYTHING TO DO WITH THAT? I WOULD LIKE TO DROP THEM BECAUSE THEY MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR ME TO RELAX AND I THINK THEY ARE A LARGE PART OF MY PRISON. COULD YOU PLEASE INDICATE A WAY?\nJANE MULLER,\nIt simply shows you are really a religious person! Such great problems arise only for religious people. These are good signs. Having sexual fantasies is an indication that you are reaching towards a higher plane of spirituality. It happens only on higher planes of spirituality! Ordinary mortals don’t have such things. They may have sex, but they don’t have sexual fantasies. And sex in the genitals is perfectly good, but in the head... everything becomes topsy-turvy!\nBut religious people have been doing that for centuries. It is a kind of sirshasan – headstand. They stand on their head so the sexual energy, just because of gravitation, starts going in their head! Either physically they do the headstand or psychologically. But remember, everything belonging to its own center is healthy; whenever it starts entering into another center, into the territory of another center, you are going insane.\nBut the so-called religious people have been insane; they have created a whole insane humanity. And once you are trapped in any insanity you will start finding many things. First, because of your prejudices you will not be able to see the real cause. Your prejudices will show you some cause which is not the real cause and you will start fighting with that cause, and the real cause remains somewhere else.\nYou say: AND I THINK THEY ARE A LARGE PART OF MY PRISON.\nThey have nothing to do with your prison. Your condemnation of sex creates the prison. It is your condemnation, not your sexual energies.\nYou say: EVEN THOUGH I SEE HOW THEY ARE TAKING ME AWAY FROM LIFE HERE AND NOW...\nThey are not taking you away from life, In fact, your so-called spirituality – the heaven there far away above the clouds, and God the father sitting on a golden throne, always looking at you like a peeping Tom... Wherever you go, even in your bathroom, he never leaves you alone – he is always looking from the keyhole, what you are doing, what Jane Muller is doing? And not only in your bathroom, he has a hole in your head too, a small window, and he goes on looking in your head, what you are thinking, what you are doing. He is constantly after you.\nThis idea of God, this idea of a heaven somewhere else, this idea of attaining immortality by overpowering, controlling your sexuality, is what is taking you away from life here and now. It is not sexuality. In fact, if a fantasy is moving in your head, that is your here and now – enjoy it! But\nyou push it aside, you say, “No, I want to go to heaven! I want to be respected as a saint.” You are pushing your herenow – your fantasy is your reality. That’s what you are, that’s where you are at. Enjoy it! What is wrong in it? Just a private TV! What is wrong in it? Make it a little more colorful, make it a little more juicy. Paint it, be a little more artistic about it, be creative. It is not your problem. Your problem is some phony kind of spirituality that is dominating you – and then one has to find these stupid rationalizations.\nYou say: ACCORDING TO ASTROLOGY, A SCORPIO HAS ESPECIALLY STRONG SEXUAL DESIRES. I AM A SCORPIO.\nNow, don’t blame poor Scorpio! Stars have nothing to do with you – they have their own problems. They are having fantasies of female stars! And one thing is absolutely certain, I know it: no star is so stupid to say that “Jane Muller is the cause of my trouble.” This is just a rationalization – avoid such rationalizations.\nA parrot kept raiding the henhouse to mount the hens. The result was chickens with crooked beaks. To put a stop to this the farmer electrified the middle rung of the roost ladder.\nThe next morning the parrot came again, climbed on the ladder and boasted, “Tra-la-la, tra-la-lo, get ready girls here we go!”\nWhen he got to the middle rung the shock almost knocked him over, causing him to cry, “Wowww! I am really in top shape today!”\nDon’t be a parrot! If you are having sexual fantasies it simply shows you are a human being – not a Scorpio!\nSome fool has calculated – must be a fool because otherwise who is bothered about such nonsense? – that every man has a sexual fantasy arising in his head after each three seconds, and a woman after each six seconds. Women are far more spiritual, doubly spiritual! Maybe that is one of the problems between men and women. Women all know that these men are sinners, continuously thinking of women, and all women have that attitude of “holier-than-thou”, particularly wives; they don’t show any interest. They also have sexual fantasies, but the gap is there.\nSo whenever the husband says, “What about it today?” immediately the wife says, “Enough is enough! Today it is impossible. The servant has not turned up, the electricity has gone, my daughter is not back yet, it is too late in the night, and moreover I am having a great headache!” This is spirituality! But deep down she knows that this is a way of getting upper hand, and he will come crawling with his tail underneath his legs – he will come crawling. And why miss an opportunity if you can pretend to be spiritual?\nYou are just a human being!\nTwo Martians arrive by night on earth. They land their flying saucer in a petrol station. Very cautiously they slither out of their spaceship and look at the row of petrol pumps.\n“Well,” whispers one, “look at the pricks of these earthmen – they are much bigger than ours!”\n“That’s true,” replied the second, “but I wonder why they stick them in their ears when they go to sleep!”\nAre you having this kind of fantasies? Then you may be a Scorpio! Otherwise why not just be a human being? Why bring poor astrology in?\nNothing is wrong in having sexual fantasies – perfectly good, poetic! If you fight they will come more; if you push them away, they will rebounce. If you accept them, if you just watch them, they will start evaporating.\nYes, one can transcend sex, but not by fighting. Fighting only makes the problem more complicated. It is only by witnessing that transcendence happens, and it is better to start witnessing right now.\nJane Muller, I don’t know how old you are, because the older you will get more and more fantasies will be coming, and the older you will get less and less the possibility of becoming a witness. The younger you are the better, because the fantasies are also great – worth witnessing! When you become older they become dirty, not worth witnessing at all. They also become old, mind you. They are just like skeletons. When you are younger your fantasies are younger and you also have energy enough to be a witness. When you are older your energy also starts getting low – and witnessing needs energy.\nAnd if you understand the whole process of witnessing it is simple. The first requirement is not to have this antagonistic, religious idea, otherwise you can never be a witness. You are already fighting – how can you witness? Witnessing needs a non-judgmental awareness: nothing is good, nothing is bad; whatsoever is, is, and you have to see it. It is moving on the screen of the mind and you are just viewing it. When you become older you may fall asleep when you are viewing it, you may not have enough energy to witness. You will not have enough energy even to put your prejudices aside. You may not have enough energy to cleanse yourself of all kinds of nonsense that others have loaded you with.\nThe religious people at their dying moment, the last moment, are full of sexual fantasies and nothing else. That’s what they have been repressing their whole life. When they were alive they could repress it, they were sitting on top of it; but when they are dying their energy is evaporating, and the repressed snake is uncoiling.\nA famous Soviet academic, Petya, is dying, and his friend and colleague, Vasya, comes to his bedside to pay his last respects to this great old man. He finds Petya Lying there with closed eyes and a sad look on his face.\nSlowly he opens his eyes, looks at his friend, and then says, “Vasya, look at all those books on that wall over there – just look at them.”\n“Yes, Petya,” replies his friend. “Those are your most famous works. Everyone knows what an important and...”\n“Yes, yes, yes!” interrupts Petya. “But look over there at that wall – you see all those books?” “Yes, my dear friend. Those are the translations of your works into all the languages of the...”\n“Yes, but that is not the point. Look over there – do you see those books?”\n“But of course. Those are the works of your students and followers. We all admire...”\n“No, but you don’t understand, Vasya!” exclaims Petya. “Look, do you remember when we were students, and we were sent off to work on the collective farm?”\n“Of course I remember, my friend. How could I forget?”\n“And do you remember, Vasya, walking down that country road one hot summer’s day?” “Yes, Petya, yes I do.”\n“And do you remember, we passed that cornfield, and there, sitting on the top of one of the haystacks, was that pretty young Masha?”\n“Yes, yes, Petya, I do! You liked her, I remember!”\n“Yes,” says Petya, sinking back onto his pillow with a blissful smile on his face. “You know what I did, Vasya? I climbed up on top of the haystack and we were really starting to have a bloody good time. But you know, my friend, those bloody haystacks – just when you are really getting somewhere, whoosh!... they give way under you. I did everything I could, but every time that bloody haystack... So you see, I have just been thinking, Vasya” – Petya looked round the room – “how it would have been if we had all these bloody books underneath us!”\nA dying old academic... at the last moment, what he is thinking about?\nJane Muller, there is still time. Don’t fight with your sexual fantasies, stop fighting. Don’t call them your prison – they are not.\nYou say: HAVE MY FANTASIES ANYTHING TO DO WITH THAT? I WOULD LIKE TO DROP THEM...\nThat’s why you are creating them; the very idea of dropping them is the cause. Drop this idea. If you want to drop anything, drop this idea!\n... BECAUSE THEY MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR ME TO RELAX.\nYou are talking simple nonsense! Who has ever heard that sexual fantasies prevent people from relaxing? In fact, that is the only way people relax! That’s a way of relaxing. Actual sex is also a way of natural relief. Have you ever heard of any man or woman dying from a heart failure while making love? If has not happened yet. There is not a single exception in the whole medical history. People have died in all kinds of conditions – jogging they have died, sitting doing nothing, meditating they have died, doing yoga postures, standing on their head they have died, praying they have died, but never making love. And it is a great exercise – it is almost like jogging! Your heart beats faster, your breathing goes berserk, you are perspiring, your blood circulates faster, your whole body is throbbing, tingling. You are in a state of madness. It is a temporary madness, but immensely\nrelaxing. You come to a peak of madness that you call orgasm, you come to a moment of great, tense climax... and the relaxation.\nNow all the heart specialists in the world are advising their patients to make love if they want to survive. For the heart it is good, it relaxes. And sexual fantasies are also not in any way anti- relaxation.\nWhat is making you tense, Jane Muller, is your antagonism. You are in a doublebind. The sexual fantasies are there and they will remain there because you want to drop them... and you don’t know how to go beyond them, you simply want to drop them. You cannot drop them that simply; you have to learn the whole art of witnessing. You can go beyond, but you cannot drop them. Of course, when you have gone beyond they are dropped, but you never dropped them actually; you simply transcended, you surpassed.\nWithout knowing the art of surpassing you are trying to drop them; that is making you tense. And the very effort of dropping them... and still they are there. The more you try to drop them the more they are there. Naturally you feel frustrated, you feel a failure, you feel guilty, and that guilt creates tension. It has nothing to do with your sexual fantasies. Relaxation and sexual fantasies are not related at all; and if they are related, sexual fantasies help people to relax.\nBut if you are religious then the problem arises. It is your religiousness that is creating the whole trouble for you. Drop this religiousness. Learn the art of witnessing; that is the science of transcendence. And once you have transcended you will know that those sexual energies are not thrown away but they are transformed. The same energies have become your ecstasies. The same energies are now giving a perfume. Before they were stinking, now they are creating a perfume, a fragrance.\nYou ask me: COULD YOU PLEASE INDICATE A WAY?\nIf you want to drop them then I cannot indicate a way, but if you want to transcend them then certainly I can indicate a way. Learn to watch – and watch blissfully! Watch joyously! Nothing is wrong in them, nothing at all. It is natural. It is your biology, it is your chemistry, it is your physiology, it is your psychology. But by watching you go beyond your physiology, beyond your biology, beyond your chemistry, beyond your psychology. You simply become a watcher, a witness. That witnessing makes you centered in your spirituality and that is the transcendence.\nThe last question:\nQuestion 3 OSHO,\nI HAVE HEARD YOU SAY THAT PARROTS ARE BETTER THAN PUNDITS. I HAVE ALSO HEARD YOU PRAISE THE IGNORANT CHILDREN MORE THAN THE GREAT KNOWLEDGEABLE PEOPLE. I CANNOT UNDERSTAND THIS AT ALL. ARE YOU NOT EXAGGERATING?\nPUNDIT LAJJASHANKARA JHA,\nDo you see? You cannot understand even such a simple thing! Everybody is understanding it here except Pundit Lajjashankara Jha. I am not exaggerating. Truth cannot be exaggerated, it is impossible. Even if you want to do you cannot do it. Only lies can be exaggerated – they have to be exaggerated. Truth is so vast, there is no way to exaggerate it. But I can illustrate it:\nThe great scholarly doctor who had published many research papers – must have been something like my physician, Devaraj – had just finished his first delivery.\n“Not bad,” said the old nurse who was helping him. “But it is the baby you should smack on the bottom, not the mother.”\nPundit Lajjashankara Jha, did you hear about the German professor of philosophy who had used up all of his sick days? He called in to say he was dead.\nAt an auction sale a brahmin pundit was trying to buy a parrot. Every time he bid, someone bid higher. Finally the auctioneer declared the bird his, but for a very high sum.\n“Can he talk?” he asked the auctioneer.\n“And how!” screamed the parrot. “Who do you think pushed the price up so high?”\n“Are these the only two parrots you have for sale?” asked the rabbi, who used to speak only in the holy language, Hebrew, and had to keep an interpreter always with him.\n“At the moment, sir, yes,” said the shopkeeper. “Then I will take the one on the right,” said the rabbi.\n“Unfortunately, sir, it is not that easy. You will have to take them both.” ’Why is that?” asked the rabbi.\n“Because that one only speaks Greek, the other is his translator.”\nPundit Lajjashankara Jha, knowledgeability is not against ignorance, it is in fact a cover-up for ignorance. Knowledgeability is not wisdom. Knowledgeability is like a blind man knowing all about light, but he still remains blind. Even if you know everything about light and you don’t have a light in the room, your room remains dark.\nWisdom is like light. Whether you know anything about light or not does not matter, what matters is light.\nAnd that’s why I praise children more: at least they are simply ignorant. Their ignorance has a certain innocence in it. The knowledgeable person is ignorant and cunning. He is ignorant, but hiding it. He is a hypocrite. He is cheating others and maybe cheating himself too. The child is ignorant because he is innocent. And from ignorance there is a way towards wisdom, but there is no way from knowledge. The knowledgeable person first will have to become ignorant, then only he can move towards wisdom.\nIgnorance is like a crossroad: you can go towards the direction of knowledge, but it never leads towards wisdom and from knowledgeability there is no way to wisdom. You will have to come back to the crossroad from where another direction opens, another dimension: that of wisdom.\nHence Jesus says, “Unless you are like small children you will not enter into my kingdom of God.” And Socrates said in his ripe old age, “I know only one thing, that I know nothing.” The Upanishads say, “The person who says ‘I know’ knows nothing, and the person who says ‘I don’t know’ knows it.”\nI certainly praise the children, because I would like you to become again the same kind of innocence that children have. I would like you to be born again, to be a twice-born – to have a second childhood is the beginning of wisdom.\nAnd just watch the small children – their perceptiveness, their clarity, their sensitiveness, their awareness, their intelligence – and then you will not call them “just ignorant”. Their ignorance is very much pregnant with wisdom, and the knowledgeable person is very much dry, dead; he is not pregnant. Knowledge is sterile.\nThe schoolteacher was angry with little Johnny. “Your essay about ‘My Dog’ is exactly the same as your brother’s!” she shouted.\n“Please, Miss, it is the same dog. What can I do?”\nA young female biology teacher, wearing a rose in the plunging neckline of her dress, asks her class, “How are roses nourished?”\nLittle Max calls out, “With milk, Miss.”\nThe teacher cuffs his head and says, “Don’t be fresh! Roses are nourished with water.” In tears, Max sobs, “I am sorry, Miss. I did not know their stems were so long!”\nThe teacher of a class of ten-year-olds is too shy to conduct the sex-education class and so she asks her class to make this a homework project.\nLittle Eddy asks his father, who mumbles something about a stork. His grandmother says he came from a cabbage patch. His great-grandmother blushes and whispers that children come from the great ocean of existence.\nThe next day Eddy gets called first to report on his project. He says, “I am afraid there is something wrong in my family. Apparently, nobody has had a good fuck for three generations!”\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"5955","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_wild_geese_and_the_water/part4/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_wild_geese_and_the_water/>The Wild Geese and the Water</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">4 Soul-living by Loving</h1><div class=post-meta>28 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;5955 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Wild_Geese_and_the_Water/part4.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part3>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

I USED TO THINK THAT CLARITY, WIT AND ANALYSIS WAS THE WAY, BUT
THEY ARE ALL GARBAGE ALONGSIDE HUGGING.</p><p><br></p><p>PREM AMIDA,</p><p><br></p><p>MAN NEEDS TO BE NEEDED. It is one of the most fundamental needs of
human beings. Unless one is cared for one starts dying. Unless one feels
that he is significant to somebody, at least to somebody, his whole life
becomes insignificant.</p><p><br></p><p>Hence love is the greatest therapy there is. The world needs therapy
because the world is missing love. In a really loving world no therapy
will be needed at all; love will be enough, more than enough. Hugging is
only a gesture of love, of warmth, of caring. the very feel of the
warmth flowing from the other person melts many illnesses in you, melts
the ice-like, cold ego. It makes you again a child.</p><p><br></p><p>The psychologists are well aware of the fact now that unless a child
is hugged, kissed, he misses some nourishment. Just as the body needs
food, the soul needs love. You can give to the child all</p><p>the physical needs, all the physical comforts, but if hugging is
missing the child will not grow in a wholesome being. He will remain
somewhere deep down sad, uncared for, neglected, ignored. He was nursed,
but he was not mothered.</p><p><br></p><p>It has been observed that if a child is not hugged he starts
shrinking – he can even die – although everything else was provided for.
As far as the body is concerned every care was taken, but no love
surrounded the child. He became isolated, he became disconnected with
existence.</p><p><br></p><p>Love is our connection, love is our very root. Just as you breathe –
for the body it is absolutely essential: stop breathing and you are no
more – in the same way, love is the inner breath. The soul lives by
loving.</p><p><br></p><p>Analysis won’t do it. Wit and clarity, knowledge and scholarship
won’t do it. You can know all there is to know about therapy, you can
become an expert, but if you don’t know the art of love you remain only
on the surface of the miracle of therapy.</p><p><br></p><p>The moment you start feeling for the patient, for the one who is
suffering... out of hundred cases, ninety people are suffering basically
because they have not been loved. If you start feeling the need for love
of the patient, and if you can fulfill the need, there will be almost a
magical change in the condition of the patient.</p><p><br></p><p>Love is certainly the most therapeutic phenomenon. Sigmund Freud was
very much afraid of it, so much so... hugging was beyond the question –
he was not even ready to face the patient, because listening to his
misery, listening to his inner nightmares, he may start feeling
sympathetic. His eyes may become wet, tears may start flowing, or maybe
in an unguarded moment he may hold the hand of the patient.</p><p><br></p><p>He was so much afraid of any loving relationship between the
therapist and the patient that he created a certain device: the patient
has to lie down on the couch and behind the couch the psychoanalyst has
to sit, so they are not facing each other.</p><p><br></p><p>And remember one thing: it is by facing each other that love grows.
Animals cannot grow love because they make love to each other without
facing each other, so there is no friendship, no relatedness. Once they
are finished with lovemaking they go their ways – separately, not even
saying a thankyou, or goodbye, or see you soon! Animals have not been
able to create friendship, family, society, for the simple reason
because when they are making love they are not looking into each other’s
eyes, they are not looking into each other’s face; as if their
lovemaking is almost mechanical; there is no human element in it.</p><p><br></p><p>Man created the whole dimension of all kinds of relationships for the
simple reason because he is the only animal who makes love facing each
other. Then eyes start communicating, then facial expressions become a
subtle language. Then the changes of mood and emotions – the joy, the
ecstasy, the orgasmic glow – and intimacy grows. Intimacy needs it; it
is a basic requirement.</p><p><br></p><p>Hence it is good to make love in light, not in darkness – at least a
dim light, a candle light. Making love in darkness is just something
animal in us, avoiding to face each other... a strategy to avoid.</p><p>Sigmund Freud was very much afraid of love; he was afraid of his own
repressed love. He was afraid that he may get into some entanglement,
involvement. He wanted to be just outside, not to be involved with the
person, not to become part of his interiority, not to enter into deep
waters but just to remain a scientific observer, aloof, detached, cool,
far away. He wanted to create psychoanalysis as if it is a science. It
is not a science, and it is never going to be a science! It is an art,
and it is far more closer to love than to logic.</p><p><br></p><p>And the real psychoanalyst will not avoid getting deep into the
interiority of the patient – he will take the risk. It is risky, it is
going into troubled waters. You may be drowned yourself – after all, you
are also human! You may get into some trouble, complexity; you may
create some problems for yourself, but that risk has to be taken.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why I love Wilhelm Reich very much. He is the man who
transformed the face of whole psychoanalysis – by getting involved with
the patient. He discarded the couch, he discarded this detached
aloofness. He is a far greater revolutionary than Sigmund Freud. Sigmund
Freud remained traditional; he was really afraid of his own
repressions.</p><p><br></p><p>If you are not afraid of your own repressions you can help
tremendously. If you are not afraid of your own unconscious, if you have
solved your problems a little bit, you can help greatly by getting
involved into the world of the patient, by becoming a participant rather
than remaining just an observer.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, because psychoanalysts are having their own problems,
sometimes even more than the patient himself, one can understand Sigmund
Freud’s fear. As far as I am concerned, I would like to make a
categorical statement about it: unless a person is really awakened,
enlightened, he cannot be a real, authentic therapist. Only a Buddha can
be a real therapist because he has no problems left. He can merge and
melt into the patient; in fact, for him the patient is not the patient
at all.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s the difference between the relationship that exists between a
patient and his therapist and the relationship that exists between a
disciple and a Master. The disciple is not a patient, the disciple is a
beloved, a loved one. The Master is not just an observer, he has become
a participant. They have lost their separate entities, they have become
one, and that oneness helps.</p><p><br></p><p>Hugging is only a gesture of oneness – even the gesture helps. Prem
Amida, you are right. You ask: WHY IS HUGGING SUCH AN INCREDIBLY
EFFECTIVE THERAPEUTIC TOOL?</p><p>It is, and it is only a gesture. If it is true – not only a gesture
but your heart is also in it – it can be a magical tool, it can be a
miracle. It can transform the whole situation instantly.</p><p><br></p><p>Few things have to be understood about it. One is: the idea that the
child dies and the man becomes adolescent, then the adolescent dies and
the man becomes young, then the young man dies and he becomes
middle-aged, and so on, so forth, is wrong. The child never dies –
nothing ever dies. The child is there, always is there, wrapped by other
experiences – wrapped by adolescence, then by youth, then by middle age,
then by old age – but the child is always there.</p><p><br></p><p>You are just like an onion, layers upon layers, but if you peel the
onion soon you will find fresher layers inside. Go on deeper and you
find more and more, fresher layers. The same is true about</p><p>man: if you go deep into him you will always find the innocent child
– and to contact that innocent child is therapeutic.</p><p><br></p><p>Hugging gives you an immediate contact with the child. If you hug
somebody with warmth, love, if it is not just an impotent gesture, if it
is meaningful, significant, true, if your heart is flowing through it,
immediately you come in contact with the child, with the innocent child.
And the innocent child even for a single moment surfacing makes a
tremendous difference because the innocence of the child is always
healthy and whole; it is uncorrupted. You have reached to the innermost
core of the person where no corruption has ever entered, you have
reached to the virgin core, and just making the virgin core throb again
with life is enough. You have started, triggered a process of
healing.</p><p><br></p><p>Hence all the religions have used this phenomenon in different ways.
Whenever Jesus prays to God he always calls him ABBA. Christians have
translated it as “God the Father”; that translation is not right, is
very inaccurate – in a way literally true, but the metaphor has changed.
ABBA can only be translated as “daddy”, not as “father”; “father” seems
to be cold. Just repeat the word father and it looks so far away. “God
the Father”... Looks like an institution! Father is really an
institution, it is not a natural phenomenon. The mother is natural, the
father is only a creation of a certain society. There have been
societies before where father never existed.</p><p><br></p><p>The word uncle is far more older than the word father. In a
matriarchal society people knew about the mother, but because the
marriage has not come into existence yet no child knew about the father.
So all the people who have been the lovers of the mother – somebody out
of them must be the father but that is not known – so all the people who
could have been the lovers were known as uncles.</p><p><br></p><p>In Talmud, the Jewish God says: “Remember, I am not nice, I am not
your uncle!” The uncle is always nice, the father almost never. It is
very difficult to be friendly with the father, it is very easy to be
friendly with the uncle. I would rather say it is better to call “God
the Uncle” than to call him “God the Father”. It is closer, nicer, more
friendly. But to call him ABBA is the best. Jesus is giving him a name
which creates intimacy.</p><p><br></p><p>When you call God ABBA – Daddy – you are saying, “I am just a child.
Take care of me, don’t ignore me. I cannot live without you – you are my
life. Your love is my very nourishment.”</p><p><br></p><p>All the religions have used the idea that unless a man becomes a
child again he cannot be truly religious. But to be a child means to be
innocent, means to be full of wonder, means to be full of awe. For the
child everything is a mystery – everything. He has no answers, he has
only questions. He is immensely interested in knowing, he is open. The
moment you have an answer you become closed, to that extent. If you have
all the answers for all the questions you are absolutely closed, then
you are not open. Your enquiry is finished, and with the enquiry
finished you are dead.</p><p><br></p><p>A real being is always enquiring, he is always on the pilgrimage. He
remains always an agnostic. All children are agnostics, neither theists
nor atheists, nor Hindus nor Mohammedans, nor Catholics nor Protestants.
They are simply innocent! They don’t believe in anything but they are
ready to enquire, to investigate. And the enquiring heart is a healthy
heart. When you are loaded with beliefs you are ill.</p><p>The Christian is ill, the Hindu is ill, the Jaina is ill – ill
because they are prejudiced, ill because without seeing they have
believed, ill because they are behaving stupidly. How can you believe in
something that you have not known! And when you know something there is
no need to believe at all, so belief in any case is ridiculous. Either
you know or you don’t know. If you know there is no need to believe; if
you don’t know, how can you believe? So belief is only for the
mediocres, the stupids, the idiots. And no child is an idiot. Every
child is so fresh, so alive, so full of zest that his very aliveness
makes him healthy.</p><p><br></p><p>If you can touch the child in the patient in any way... and hugging
is simply one of the most important things.</p><p><br></p><p>Because I have allowed my sannyasins to hug and kiss I am condemned
all over the country – that I am telling my people to be indulgent. If
this is indulgence, then let it be indulgence. This is not indulgence at
all; there is something more in it. I am telling to you to be loving,
and just sitting with somebody and telling him again and again, “I love
you,” is not enough. At least hold the hand! Make it a reality – hug the
person.</p><p><br></p><p>A very shy Englishman... and he must be very shy, otherwise just to
be an Englishman is enough; there is no need to use the adjective “shy”.
They are all shy! They are the most perfect gentlemen in the world –
and, of course, in the same proportion they are dead too! Who has ever
heard about a gentleman who is alive? If you are alive you are a man,
why gentle? For what? Corpses are always gentle: they cannot do any
harm, and they look so polite, so humble!</p><p><br></p><p>This shy gentleman was seeing a young woman for months. One full-moon
night they were sitting together in the porch, looking in the garden,
and beyond the garden the moon was rising. And the shy Englishman
gathered courage; it must have been a real great mighty effort! My own
feeling is it must be because of the moon; the moon drives people crazy,
hence the word “lunatic”. Lunatic means “struck by the moon”. Lunatic
comes from “lunar”, the moon – the moonstruck. He must have gone
lunatic.</p><p><br></p><p>He asked the lady, “Can I..can I kiss you?”</p><p><br></p><p>And the lady was really getting tired, so she said, “And what do you
think? Am I waiting here for a bus?”</p><p><br></p><p>When you love a person just verbal expressions are not enough, words
are not enough; something more substantial is needed; words are only
abstract. You have to do something! Hold the hand, hug the person, kiss
the person, embrace the person. It is going to help you both: if you can
melt in the hug you both will become again younger, fresher, livelier.
And that’s the whole process of healing.</p><p><br></p><p>Prem Amida, analysis is the way of the mind, hugging is the way of
the heart. The mind is the cause of all diseases and the heart is the
source of all healing.</p><p><br></p><p>The second question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2</p><p><br></p><p>OSHO,</p><p>I HAVE A LOT OF FANTASIES, ESPECIALLY SEXUAL ONES. EVEN THOUGH I SEE
HOW THEY ARE TAKING ME AWAY FROM LIFE HERE AND NOW, I LET MYSELF BE
DOMINATED BY THEM. ACCORDING TO ASTROLOGY, A SCORPIO HAS ESPECIALLY
STRONG SEXUAL DESIRES. I AM A SCORPIO.</p><p><br></p><p>HAVE MY FANTASIES ANYTHING TO DO WITH THAT? I WOULD LIKE TO DROP THEM
BECAUSE THEY MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR ME TO RELAX AND I THINK THEY ARE A
LARGE PART OF MY PRISON. COULD YOU PLEASE INDICATE A WAY?</p><p><br></p><p>JANE MULLER,</p><p><br></p><p>It simply shows you are really a religious person! Such great
problems arise only for religious people. These are good signs. Having
sexual fantasies is an indication that you are reaching towards a higher
plane of spirituality. It happens only on higher planes of spirituality!
Ordinary mortals don’t have such things. They may have sex, but they
don’t have sexual fantasies. And sex in the genitals is perfectly good,
but in the head... everything becomes topsy-turvy!</p><p><br></p><p>But religious people have been doing that for centuries. It is a kind
of sirshasan – headstand. They stand on their head so the sexual energy,
just because of gravitation, starts going in their head! Either
physically they do the headstand or psychologically. But remember,
everything belonging to its own center is healthy; whenever it starts
entering into another center, into the territory of another center, you
are going insane.</p><p><br></p><p>But the so-called religious people have been insane; they have
created a whole insane humanity. And once you are trapped in any
insanity you will start finding many things. First, because of your
prejudices you will not be able to see the real cause. Your prejudices
will show you some cause which is not the real cause and you will start
fighting with that cause, and the real cause remains somewhere else.</p><p><br></p><p>You say: AND I THINK THEY ARE A LARGE PART OF MY PRISON.</p><p><br></p><p>They have nothing to do with your prison. Your condemnation of sex
creates the prison. It is your condemnation, not your sexual
energies.</p><p><br></p><p>You say: EVEN THOUGH I SEE HOW THEY ARE TAKING ME AWAY FROM LIFE HERE
AND NOW...</p><p><br></p><p>They are not taking you away from life, In fact, your so-called
spirituality – the heaven there far away above the clouds, and God the
father sitting on a golden throne, always looking at you like a peeping
Tom... Wherever you go, even in your bathroom, he never leaves you alone
– he is always looking from the keyhole, what you are doing, what Jane
Muller is doing? And not only in your bathroom, he has a hole in your
head too, a small window, and he goes on looking in your head, what you
are thinking, what you are doing. He is constantly after you.</p><p><br></p><p>This idea of God, this idea of a heaven somewhere else, this idea of
attaining immortality by overpowering, controlling your sexuality, is
what is taking you away from life here and now. It is not sexuality. In
fact, if a fantasy is moving in your head, that is your here and now –
enjoy it! But</p><p>you push it aside, you say, “No, I want to go to heaven! I want to be
respected as a saint.” You are pushing your herenow – your fantasy is
your reality. That’s what you are, that’s where you are at. Enjoy it!
What is wrong in it? Just a private TV! What is wrong in it? Make it a
little more colorful, make it a little more juicy. Paint it, be a little
more artistic about it, be creative. It is not your problem. Your
problem is some phony kind of spirituality that is dominating you – and
then one has to find these stupid rationalizations.</p><p><br></p><p>You say: ACCORDING TO ASTROLOGY, A SCORPIO HAS ESPECIALLY STRONG
SEXUAL DESIRES. I AM A SCORPIO.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, don’t blame poor Scorpio! Stars have nothing to do with you –
they have their own problems. They are having fantasies of female stars!
And one thing is absolutely certain, I know it: no star is so stupid to
say that “Jane Muller is the cause of my trouble.” This is just a
rationalization – avoid such rationalizations.</p><p><br></p><p>A parrot kept raiding the henhouse to mount the hens. The result was
chickens with crooked beaks. To put a stop to this the farmer
electrified the middle rung of the roost ladder.</p><p><br></p><p>The next morning the parrot came again, climbed on the ladder and
boasted, “Tra-la-la, tra-la-lo, get ready girls here we go!”</p><p><br></p><p>When he got to the middle rung the shock almost knocked him over,
causing him to cry, “Wowww! I am really in top shape today!”</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t be a parrot! If you are having sexual fantasies it simply shows
you are a human being – not a Scorpio!</p><p><br></p><p>Some fool has calculated – must be a fool because otherwise who is
bothered about such nonsense? – that every man has a sexual fantasy
arising in his head after each three seconds, and a woman after each six
seconds. Women are far more spiritual, doubly spiritual! Maybe that is
one of the problems between men and women. Women all know that these men
are sinners, continuously thinking of women, and all women have that
attitude of “holier-than-thou”, particularly wives; they don’t show any
interest. They also have sexual fantasies, but the gap is there.</p><p><br></p><p>So whenever the husband says, “What about it today?” immediately the
wife says, “Enough is enough! Today it is impossible. The servant has
not turned up, the electricity has gone, my daughter is not back yet, it
is too late in the night, and moreover I am having a great headache!”
This is spirituality! But deep down she knows that this is a way of
getting upper hand, and he will come crawling with his tail underneath
his legs – he will come crawling. And why miss an opportunity if you can
pretend to be spiritual?</p><p><br></p><p>You are just a human being!</p><p><br></p><p>Two Martians arrive by night on earth. They land their flying saucer
in a petrol station. Very cautiously they slither out of their spaceship
and look at the row of petrol pumps.</p><p><br></p><p>“Well,” whispers one, “look at the pricks of these earthmen – they
are much bigger than ours!”</p><p>“That’s true,” replied the second, “but I wonder why they stick them
in their ears when they go to sleep!”</p><p><br></p><p>Are you having this kind of fantasies? Then you may be a Scorpio!
Otherwise why not just be a human being? Why bring poor astrology
in?</p><p><br></p><p>Nothing is wrong in having sexual fantasies – perfectly good, poetic!
If you fight they will come more; if you push them away, they will
rebounce. If you accept them, if you just watch them, they will start
evaporating.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, one can transcend sex, but not by fighting. Fighting only makes
the problem more complicated. It is only by witnessing that
transcendence happens, and it is better to start witnessing right
now.</p><p><br></p><p>Jane Muller, I don’t know how old you are, because the older you will
get more and more fantasies will be coming, and the older you will get
less and less the possibility of becoming a witness. The younger you are
the better, because the fantasies are also great – worth witnessing!
When you become older they become dirty, not worth witnessing at all.
They also become old, mind you. They are just like skeletons. When you
are younger your fantasies are younger and you also have energy enough
to be a witness. When you are older your energy also starts getting low
– and witnessing needs energy.</p><p><br></p><p>And if you understand the whole process of witnessing it is simple.
The first requirement is not to have this antagonistic, religious idea,
otherwise you can never be a witness. You are already fighting – how can
you witness? Witnessing needs a non-judgmental awareness: nothing is
good, nothing is bad; whatsoever is, is, and you have to see it. It is
moving on the screen of the mind and you are just viewing it. When you
become older you may fall asleep when you are viewing it, you may not
have enough energy to witness. You will not have enough energy even to
put your prejudices aside. You may not have enough energy to cleanse
yourself of all kinds of nonsense that others have loaded you with.</p><p><br></p><p>The religious people at their dying moment, the last moment, are full
of sexual fantasies and nothing else. That’s what they have been
repressing their whole life. When they were alive they could repress it,
they were sitting on top of it; but when they are dying their energy is
evaporating, and the repressed snake is uncoiling.</p><p><br></p><p>A famous Soviet academic, Petya, is dying, and his friend and
colleague, Vasya, comes to his bedside to pay his last respects to this
great old man. He finds Petya Lying there with closed eyes and a sad
look on his face.</p><p><br></p><p>Slowly he opens his eyes, looks at his friend, and then says, “Vasya,
look at all those books on that wall over there – just look at
them.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, Petya,” replies his friend. “Those are your most famous works.
Everyone knows what an important and...”</p><p>“Yes, yes, yes!” interrupts Petya. “But look over there at that wall
– you see all those books?” “Yes, my dear friend. Those are the
translations of your works into all the languages of the...”</p><p>“Yes, but that is not the point. Look over there – do you see those
books?”</p><p><br></p><p>“But of course. Those are the works of your students and followers.
We all admire...”</p><p><br></p><p>“No, but you don’t understand, Vasya!” exclaims Petya. “Look, do you
remember when we were students, and we were sent off to work on the
collective farm?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Of course I remember, my friend. How could I forget?”</p><p><br></p><p>“And do you remember, Vasya, walking down that country road one hot
summer’s day?” “Yes, Petya, yes I do.”</p><p>“And do you remember, we passed that cornfield, and there, sitting on
the top of one of the haystacks, was that pretty young Masha?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, yes, Petya, I do! You liked her, I remember!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes,” says Petya, sinking back onto his pillow with a blissful smile
on his face. “You know what I did, Vasya? I climbed up on top of the
haystack and we were really starting to have a bloody good time. But you
know, my friend, those bloody haystacks – just when you are really
getting somewhere, whoosh!... they give way under you. I did everything
I could, but every time that bloody haystack... So you see, I have just
been thinking, Vasya” – Petya looked round the room – “how it would have
been if we had all these bloody books underneath us!”</p><p><br></p><p>A dying old academic... at the last moment, what he is thinking
about?</p><p><br></p><p>Jane Muller, there is still time. Don’t fight with your sexual
fantasies, stop fighting. Don’t call them your prison – they are
not.</p><p><br></p><p>You say: HAVE MY FANTASIES ANYTHING TO DO WITH THAT? I WOULD LIKE TO
DROP THEM...</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why you are creating them; the very idea of dropping them is
the cause. Drop this idea. If you want to drop anything, drop this
idea!</p><p><br></p><p>... BECAUSE THEY MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR ME TO RELAX.</p><p><br></p><p>You are talking simple nonsense! Who has ever heard that sexual
fantasies prevent people from relaxing? In fact, that is the only way
people relax! That’s a way of relaxing. Actual sex is also a way of
natural relief. Have you ever heard of any man or woman dying from a
heart failure while making love? If has not happened yet. There is not a
single exception in the whole medical history. People have died in all
kinds of conditions – jogging they have died, sitting doing nothing,
meditating they have died, doing yoga postures, standing on their head
they have died, praying they have died, but never making love. And it is
a great exercise – it is almost like jogging! Your heart beats faster,
your breathing goes berserk, you are perspiring, your blood circulates
faster, your whole body is throbbing, tingling. You are in a state of
madness. It is a temporary madness, but immensely</p><p>relaxing. You come to a peak of madness that you call orgasm, you
come to a moment of great, tense climax... and the relaxation.</p><p><br></p><p>Now all the heart specialists in the world are advising their
patients to make love if they want to survive. For the heart it is good,
it relaxes. And sexual fantasies are also not in any way anti-
relaxation.</p><p><br></p><p>What is making you tense, Jane Muller, is your antagonism. You are in
a doublebind. The sexual fantasies are there and they will remain there
because you want to drop them... and you don’t know how to go beyond
them, you simply want to drop them. You cannot drop them that simply;
you have to learn the whole art of witnessing. You can go beyond, but
you cannot drop them. Of course, when you have gone beyond they are
dropped, but you never dropped them actually; you simply transcended,
you surpassed.</p><p><br></p><p>Without knowing the art of surpassing you are trying to drop them;
that is making you tense. And the very effort of dropping them... and
still they are there. The more you try to drop them the more they are
there. Naturally you feel frustrated, you feel a failure, you feel
guilty, and that guilt creates tension. It has nothing to do with your
sexual fantasies. Relaxation and sexual fantasies are not related at
all; and if they are related, sexual fantasies help people to relax.</p><p><br></p><p>But if you are religious then the problem arises. It is your
religiousness that is creating the whole trouble for you. Drop this
religiousness. Learn the art of witnessing; that is the science of
transcendence. And once you have transcended you will know that those
sexual energies are not thrown away but they are transformed. The same
energies have become your ecstasies. The same energies are now giving a
perfume. Before they were stinking, now they are creating a perfume, a
fragrance.</p><p><br></p><p>You ask me: COULD YOU PLEASE INDICATE A WAY?</p><p><br></p><p>If you want to drop them then I cannot indicate a way, but if you
want to transcend them then certainly I can indicate a way. Learn to
watch – and watch blissfully! Watch joyously! Nothing is wrong in them,
nothing at all. It is natural. It is your biology, it is your chemistry,
it is your physiology, it is your psychology. But by watching you go
beyond your physiology, beyond your biology, beyond your chemistry,
beyond your psychology. You simply become a watcher, a witness. That
witnessing makes you centered in your spirituality and that is the
transcendence.</p><p><br></p><p>The last question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 3 OSHO,</p><p>I HAVE HEARD YOU SAY THAT PARROTS ARE BETTER THAN PUNDITS. I HAVE
ALSO HEARD YOU PRAISE THE IGNORANT CHILDREN MORE THAN THE GREAT
KNOWLEDGEABLE PEOPLE. I CANNOT UNDERSTAND THIS AT ALL. ARE YOU NOT
EXAGGERATING?</p><p><br></p><p>PUNDIT LAJJASHANKARA JHA,</p><p>Do you see? You cannot understand even such a simple thing! Everybody
is understanding it here except Pundit Lajjashankara Jha. I am not
exaggerating. Truth cannot be exaggerated, it is impossible. Even if you
want to do you cannot do it. Only lies can be exaggerated – they have to
be exaggerated. Truth is so vast, there is no way to exaggerate it. But
I can illustrate it:</p><p><br></p><p>The great scholarly doctor who had published many research papers –
must have been something like my physician, Devaraj – had just finished
his first delivery.</p><p><br></p><p>“Not bad,” said the old nurse who was helping him. “But it is the
baby you should smack on the bottom, not the mother.”</p><p><br></p><p>Pundit Lajjashankara Jha, did you hear about the German professor of
philosophy who had used up all of his sick days? He called in to say he
was dead.</p><p><br></p><p>At an auction sale a brahmin pundit was trying to buy a parrot. Every
time he bid, someone bid higher. Finally the auctioneer declared the
bird his, but for a very high sum.</p><p><br></p><p>“Can he talk?” he asked the auctioneer.</p><p><br></p><p>“And how!” screamed the parrot. “Who do you think pushed the price up
so high?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Are these the only two parrots you have for sale?” asked the rabbi,
who used to speak only in the holy language, Hebrew, and had to keep an
interpreter always with him.</p><p><br></p><p>“At the moment, sir, yes,” said the shopkeeper. “Then I will take the
one on the right,” said the rabbi.</p><p>“Unfortunately, sir, it is not that easy. You will have to take them
both.” ’Why is that?” asked the rabbi.</p><p>“Because that one only speaks Greek, the other is his
translator.”</p><p><br></p><p>Pundit Lajjashankara Jha, knowledgeability is not against ignorance,
it is in fact a cover-up for ignorance. Knowledgeability is not wisdom.
Knowledgeability is like a blind man knowing all about light, but he
still remains blind. Even if you know everything about light and you
don’t have a light in the room, your room remains dark.</p><p><br></p><p>Wisdom is like light. Whether you know anything about light or not
does not matter, what matters is light.</p><p><br></p><p>And that’s why I praise children more: at least they are simply
ignorant. Their ignorance has a certain innocence in it. The
knowledgeable person is ignorant and cunning. He is ignorant, but hiding
it. He is a hypocrite. He is cheating others and maybe cheating himself
too. The child is ignorant because he is innocent. And from ignorance
there is a way towards wisdom, but there is no way from knowledge. The
knowledgeable person first will have to become ignorant, then only he
can move towards wisdom.</p><p>Ignorance is like a crossroad: you can go towards the direction of
knowledge, but it never leads towards wisdom and from knowledgeability
there is no way to wisdom. You will have to come back to the crossroad
from where another direction opens, another dimension: that of
wisdom.</p><p><br></p><p>Hence Jesus says, “Unless you are like small children you will not
enter into my kingdom of God.” And Socrates said in his ripe old age, “I
know only one thing, that I know nothing.” The Upanishads say, “The
person who says ‘I know’ knows nothing, and the person who says ‘I don’t
know’ knows it.”</p><p><br></p><p>I certainly praise the children, because I would like you to become
again the same kind of innocence that children have. I would like you to
be born again, to be a twice-born – to have a second childhood is the
beginning of wisdom.</p><p><br></p><p>And just watch the small children – their perceptiveness, their
clarity, their sensitiveness, their awareness, their intelligence – and
then you will not call them “just ignorant”. Their ignorance is very
much pregnant with wisdom, and the knowledgeable person is very much
dry, dead; he is not pregnant. Knowledge is sterile.</p><p><br></p><p>The schoolteacher was angry with little Johnny. “Your essay about ‘My
Dog’ is exactly the same as your brother’s!” she shouted.</p><p><br></p><p>“Please, Miss, it is the same dog. What can I do?”</p><p><br></p><p>A young female biology teacher, wearing a rose in the plunging
neckline of her dress, asks her class, “How are roses nourished?”</p><p><br></p><p>Little Max calls out, “With milk, Miss.”</p><p><br></p><p>The teacher cuffs his head and says, “Don’t be fresh! Roses are
nourished with water.” In tears, Max sobs, “I am sorry, Miss. I did not
know their stems were so long!”</p><p>The teacher of a class of ten-year-olds is too shy to conduct the
sex-education class and so she asks her class to make this a homework
project.</p><p><br></p><p>Little Eddy asks his father, who mumbles something about a stork. His
grandmother says he came from a cabbage patch. His great-grandmother
blushes and whispers that children come from the great ocean of
existence.</p><p><br></p><p>The next day Eddy gets called first to report on his project. He
says, “I am afraid there is something wrong in my family. Apparently,
nobody has had a good fuck for three generations!”</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part3>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

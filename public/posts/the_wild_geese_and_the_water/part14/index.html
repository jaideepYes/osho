ONE OF THE QUESTIONS ON WHICH THEY WANT ME TO SPEAK IS AS FOLLOWS: WHAT IS LACKING IN THE CHRISTIAN CHURCHES THAT IS ATTRACTING SO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE TO THE NEW RELIGIOUS MOVEMENTS?\nDEVA OJAS,\nThe christ is missing...\nThe Christian churches are there but they are just containers without the content, utterly empty, a lamp whose light has gone out long before, a cage – perhaps a golden cage – but the bird has flown and it sings no more.\nMissing of the Christ is bound to attract new people into new adventures. It is always the young ones who find the real Masters. The old ones settle with the establishment, their vested interests are such. And if once in a while an old person gets into enquiry for the truth – even though it goes against his tradition, convention, belief – then that old man is old only physically; psychologically, spiritually he is young.\nOjas, remind your people back in Holland that who were the people who were attracted towards Jesus himself. Were they old? Were they young? And what was missing in the Jewish religion? Why they were attracted to Christ?\nThey were all young people; Jesus himself was very young. He died only when he was thirty-three and the people who had come to him were almost of his age. What was the reason? Begin your answer from there. Why they left the Jewish church? It has a long tradition from Abraham Moses Ezekiel, so many prophets, a beautiful scripture, the old Testament, a great system of theology and philosophy... Why they left all that behind and followed this carpenter’s son, uneducated? What was the reason?\nThe reason was that he had attained the ultimate in consciousness he has become a Christ. Remember Christ has nothing to do with Jesus as such. Jesus is the individual and the phenomenon of Christ-consciousness is universal. It has happened to many people before Jesus and to many people after Jesus; Jesus is only one of the Christs.\nBuddha is a Christ Zarathustra is a Christ, Lao Tzu is a Christ and there have been many many Christs after Jesus: Bodhidharma Lin Chi Kabir Nanak – the long long river of Christ- consciousness continues. and the young, the fresh will always be seeking for the Christ, for the Christ-consciousness. So wherever the young people find the taste of living Christ-consciousness, they are bound to go there. They are going to risk everything.\nIn the Christian churches everything is there, one the bridegroom is missing. All the guests are there, the celebration is perfectly ready to start but the bridegroom is missing. So only the old who have become almost blind – blind because of their conditioning – will not be able to see that this whole thing is just false, pseudo. Now instead of Christ they will find the Polack pope, who is just making stupid gestures.\nJust the other day he landed in a small country which is occupied by the Americans, forcibly. The American government had made every arrangement, security arrangement, for him. A car was flown from America to take him from the airport to his residence – just six kilometers, and highly guarded security arrangement was made for him. He descended from the airplane, a special airplane that was only caring for him – a big jetliner carrying just one Polack.\nAnd he talked about the dignity of the poor He descended from the airplane and kissed the earth – these are empty gestures – and he said that “I love your country so much that I kiss its very earth. But he didn’t talk about freedom. He loves the country so much... then why he didn’t talk about the freedom of the people? Why he did not say something against the people who are ruling the country forcibly? – who are occupying it? – who have made it a military base.\nHe didn’t talk about freedom. He talked about the beautiful country but he didn’t talk about the ugly imperialism. He was not received by any representative of the country; he was received by a special agent of the American president who had come just before him to receive him on behalf of Ronald Reagan.\nAnd he kissed the earth – that he goes on doing everywhere, kissing the earth. Impotent gestures. Talking about the dignity of the poor, and living in richness. These hypocrites are the people who have to be avoided – and the young can see...\nI talk about the dignity of being rich. There is no dignity in being poor, because if there is dignity in being poor, then there is dignity in being a slave too, then there is dignity in being sick too, then there is dignity in being starved too, undernourished too. These are all part of poverty.\nI talk about the dignity of the rich. One should be rich on the outside and on the inside both. There is no need to divide the outside and the inside – they are all one. And one should live as richly as possible! That shows intelligence. Why talk about the dignity of the poor? Why not destroy poverty? Why console poor people? Why tell them that “You are the children of God, special children of God”? If the poor are the children of God, then what are the rich? – the children of the devil? Then it is better to belong to devil than to God; then let him have his poor children and their dignity. But then the Pope will be a son of the devil because he is one of the richest persons in the world.\nNow, living in luxury and talking about the dignity of the poor is hypocrisy. Live the way you would like everybody to live. Live according to your own understanding, but don’t be pretenders. The young can see it, only the young can see it.\nYou must have come across the beautiful parable... I love it:\nA very great king was visited by a cunning, clever priest. All priests are clever and cunning, otherwise they cannot be priests. Prostitutes may be innocent, but priests are never innocent. In fact, only innocent girls become prostitutes. Very cunning people become priests; it is the most cunning business.\nThe priest came to the king and said that, “You have conquered the whole world. Now only one thing is missing, and unless you have that you will remain discontented.”\nThe king was surprised, because actually that was the case: he was feeling discontented. Every successful man feels discontented. The failures can always hope, the successful cannot hope any more – he has succeeded! You have heard the proverb that nothing fails like failure. I say it is all wrong. I say to you: nothing fails like success. Once you have succeeded you can see the futility of it. The riches are there, the power is there, but you are as empty as before, or maybe now you feel your emptiness more in contrast to the richness, to the power, to the success that you have achieved. Now it hurts even more. And there is no hope either – there is no tomorrow any more. You have achieved whatsoever is possible to achieve so you cannot dream, you cannot fantasize.\nThe king was feeling discontented – because he has conquered the whole world. He was very much surprised, and trusted this priest, that he has some miraculous powers: “He has read my mind. I have not told to anybody that I am feeling discontented. How he has come to know?”\nHe took him into his private chamber and said,\n“How you managed to find it out? I have never told to anybody, not even to my wife. I go on pretending that I am immensely contented and happy.”\nAll successful people do that. What is the point of saying it to everybody? They will simply laugh, that “You are a fool!” They will say that “We had told you before but you never listened,” so it is better to keep quiet.\n“How did you manage to know?”\nThe priest said, “I can read your thoughts, and I know what is missing. If you can get special clothes of the angels, then you will be immensely happy.”\nA new desire, a new hope... tomorrow again became alive.\nThe king said, “I am ready. But how to get clothes from heaven? What is the way?”\nThe priest said, “Everything I will do. I know the way, I know the whole map, but it will cost you much. It is not an easy thing. It is for the first time in the whole history of humanity that you will be getting divine clothes; you may be the first and the last. And I will have to bribe the angels, persuade somebody to steal, and then I have to fly to heaven and come back... It is a long journey and dangerous too, but for you I am ready to do it.”\nThe king said, “Don’t be worried about the money. But remember one thing: don’t try to cheat me, otherwise death will be the only reward for you. So you can have a palace to yourself; do whatsoever you want to do, but you will be guarded, you cannot leave the palace. And whatsoever money you want, you simply send a message and the money will be delivered to you.”\nAnd the priest started asking millions of rupees everyday. But the king had enough. Within three weeks the priest informed that, “The clothes have arrived. A great celebration should be arranged, people should be informed. The whole capital should be decorated with lights, fireworks, balloons, because something absolutely extraordinary is happening.”\nAnd the king did as he was told, and the whole court was waiting with great silence. And the man came with a beautiful box, golden box. He opened the box... but before opening the box, he said to the court that, “One thing I should remind you: I have been told by the angels that these clothes can be seen only by those who are born of their own fathers – no bastard can see these clothes. Remember that.”\nThen he opened the box – the box was empty. The king looked in, the viziers looked in, and everybody started praising the clothes. Who wants to be called a bastard? Everybody knew that the box is empty, but when others were praising the clothes, everybody thought within his own heart, “It is better to keep absolutely mum. It seems that I am not the son of my father. Only I am not the son of my father, because everybody else is seeing the clothes.”\nAnd when the king saw that, “All the viziers and the courtiers and the queen, everybody is seeing the clothes, so what is the point now saying that I don’t see?” – he also started praising the clothes. There was great rejoicing, and the crafty priest told the king, “Now give your clothes one by one to me and I will give you the divine clothes.”\nHis coat was taken, his shirt was taken, his turban was taken... And he was handed nothing, just nothing! Just the gesture, empty gesture. A turban was placed on his head which didn’t exist at all. He was looking silly to his own eyes. The shirt has disappeared, then he was afraid... then the pants disappeared, then he was standing just with his underpants, afraid: “Now what this man is going to do?” And everybody was clapping and shouting with joy, that “Our king has got divine clothes! How beautiful they look!”\nThen the crafty priest asked for the underpants. For a moment the king hesitated, but now it was too late. Now to say that “I don’t see,” will be very illogical. Up to now you were seeing – what happened? Suddenly you are not the son of your father? He had to give – reluctantly, but he had to give. He had given his underpants also, now he was standing absolutely naked, just like a Jaina monk. And everybody was clapping and shouting with joy, and people started dancing. And everybody was trying to defeat everybody else, so it is known to everybody that, “I am the son of my own father far more than you are.” It was a great competition.\nAnd then the crafty priest said that, “Thousands of people are waiting outside the palace. The chariot is ready. Now, sir, you come! A procession has to be taken. The whole capital is waiting. Many many people have gathered from all over the place to see the divine clothes.”\nAgain he felt for a moment very hesitant: “But if everybody is seeing the clothes, then there is no fear really. Only I am not seeing, but that is not the point. I already know,” he thought, “that I am naked. I know my nakedness and everybody is seeing so there is no fear.”\nHe went into the chariot. Everybody, millions of people, saw he was naked, but just before the chariot it was continuously announced that these clothes are divine and can be seen only by those who are born of their own others. So everybody was shouting, clapping, dancing... it was such a rejoicing,.\nJust a small child sitting on his father’s shoulders told the father, “Daddy, the king seems to be naked.”\nThe father said, “Shut up! When you will grow then you will see. You are just a child, you don’t understand.”\nBut again and again the child said, “But father, I can see everything – only the clothes I cannot see. I can see you, I can see the naked king, the chariot, the horses, millions of people. And just for the clothes I have first to become grown-up?”\nAnd the father said, “You keep absolutely silent. You don’t understand. It takes time. One has to be adult, at least twenty-one years – when you have the right to vote, that is the time when you start seeing the clothes. Wait!” And fearing that somebody may hear, he took the child away. That was the only person there in the crowd who could see that the king was naked. Everybody was seeing, but only a child can say it as it is.\nJesus was recognized only by innocent people. The rabbis killed him. Now, the same rabbis have become popes, bishops, priests – the same rabbis. It is the same business. It was done in the name of Jewism, now it is done in the name of Christianity.\nChrist is missing, Deva Ojas, that is the first thing to be remembered.\nYou ask me: WHAT IS LACKING IN THE CHRISTIAN CHURCHES THAT IS ATTRACTING SO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE TO THE NEW RELIGIOUS MOVEMENTS?\nThe second thing is that Christianity or Hinduism or Mohammedanism or Jainism or Buddhism are not your choice. You are born into a certain family which is accidental – then you are conditioned.\nIt is a conditioning. The first disciples of Jesus were not born Christians, they had chosen it. And when one chooses out of one’s own intelligence and freedom, it is a totally different matter. And when something is imposed upon you it is nothing but an imprisonment.\nNow churches are nothing but jails. And for that matter, not only Christian churches, all the churches. Only when a living Master is there and his presence triggers a process of enlightenment in you, triggers a process of transformation in you, and you choose because of that process, then you are really religious. Otherwise these are all pseudo people: Christians, Hindus, Parsees, Sikhs – all pseudo.\nThe people who had chosen Nanak were a totally different people; they had risked their life. The people who went with Mohammed were REAL Muslims, they risked everything. Being with Mohammed was not an easy job, it was risking your life, your very head; now to be a Mohammedan is convenient, comfortable. To be a Hindu costs nothing.\nIn fact, before you ever become conscious you are already conditioned, your unconscious is already stuffed with all kinds of superstitions.\nIf the younger people are moving to new religious movements, the reason is because only the new is religious; the old is always a cult. Christianity is a cult! But is is a very strange thing: Christians call new religious movements cults, sects – they are religious. Just the opposite is the truth: anything which is very old is only a cult, a sect. When Jesus is alive there is religion. When Buddha is alive there is religion. When Buddha is gone there is only left a cult.\nA cult is the corpse of a religion. A cult is only the footprints of the Buddhas on the sands of time. Buddhas disappear in the timelessness, and on the sands of time the footprints are worshipped, as if those footprints are Buddhas.\nI say to you that religion exists only in the presence of a Master. The moment the Master leaves, the religion disappears.\nIt is just like the fragrance of a rose flower. The moment the rose flower disappears, its petals start falling back to the soil, the fragrance also disappears. Religion is the fragrance of the person who has become awakened. It cannot be caught into churches – you cannot catch hold of a fragrance. Even if you keep the dead flower – as people love to keep in their Bibles, roses they keep between their Bible pages – by and by they become dry, they lose all fragrance. Just they give you a sense that once there was a flower, those dry flowers, dead flowers.\nYoung people are always searching for something alive; that’s what youth is all about. So whosoever is young, whether physically or spiritually, will always seek a Christ – wherever he can find, in whatsoever form he can find, he will find a Christ. Unless he finds a Christ he will not feel contented. And no church can be a substitute for a Christ.\nOne has to choose the religion. And these Christians, these Mohammedans, these Hindus, they have not chosen. It has been imposed on them. And remember, if you choose on your own, even the hell, then it is heaven, and if you are thrown in heaven forcibly, then it is hell. My definition of hell and heaven depends on freedom: if it is freedom, then it is heaven if it is not freedom, then it is hell.\nThe churches are against the individual, and the young people are always searching for individuality. And it is one of the intrinsic parts of youth, youthfulness, to search for authentic individuality. The churches belong to the collective mob psychology and they have fallen down to the mob psychology They fulfill the expectations of the marketplace. They fulfill the expectations of the sleepy people, somnambulists, they cannot help you to be awakened. Only a person who never fulfills your demands, who lives in his own light without caring about what the crowds say about him... Do you think Jesus in any way cared about what the crowds were saying about him? If he had cared, he would not have been crucified, he would have been given a Nobel prize, he would have been a Nobel laureate like Mother Teresa of Calcutta.\nHe is crucified, and this Mother Teresa becomes a Nobel laureate. There seems to be no connection between Mother Teresa and Jesus Christ. There is certainly a connection between Jesus Christ and Al-Hillaj Mansoor. There is certainly a connection between Jesus Christ and me. I can be crucified any day. The crowd is against me – the crowd has always been against the Buddhas, but Mother Teresa fulfills the expectations of the crowd. Only stupid people can fulfill your expectations.\nI have always been wondering, because I have come across two persons, Morarji Desai and Mother Teresa... And I had always been a lit e puzzled who is more stupid. They both seem to be greater than the other, bigger than the other. But then, finally, Nobel prize decided. Mother Teresa came first, Morarji Desai is second in the race. She fulfilled more the mob psychology and its expectations,\nJesus is crucified, Socrates is murdered. Many attempts were made on Buddha’s life. Mahavira was tortured in every possible way...\nThe young people are searching for freedom, for intelligence. The young people are searching for rebellion, for revolution, for a radical change. The church has been too heavy on their being, it is like a mountain-load. They want to throw it, but they don’t know how to do it. Unless they come across a person who has done it, who has thrown all the nonsense of the past... only he can help you to be unburdened.\nThat’s why young people, Ojas, are searching new religious movements.\nRemember, this television series in Holland is arranged by the Christians. They are becoming more and more afraid, they are becoming more and more worried. And why they have asked Ojas to come? They are going to pay him the fare and all the expenses from Poona to Amsterdam. Why? – because Ojas is an ex-priest. And they are becoming much worried. Even priests are becoming Rajneesh sannyasins! It is too dangerous. They have to find out what are the reasons, so they can manage some way to prevent. But you have to tell them the truth as it is, utterly naked. Hammer it on their head.\nTheir effort is to find out the reason so they can prevent others from escaping. And you should make every effort so that even others can escape, because there are many many nuns, many many monks, many priests, who want to escape from the slavery, but they don’t know how to do it.\nSo use this opportunity. Don’t miss the opportunity. Don’t be polite – be true. Say the truth as it is. Say that the king is naked, say that Christ is no more in the Christian churches, say that “We have found Christ somewhere else, that’s why we are going.” In fact, you are REAL Christians, they are bogus Christians.\nBut priests are certainly very cunning people.\nAt the airport a flustered young rabbi starting on his honeymoon absent-mindedly asked for one ticket to the Bahamas. But when his wife pointed out his error, he answered without a moment’s hesitation, “By Thunder! You are right, dear. I had forgotten myself completely!”\nPriests are very clever and cunning. But don’t be worried about them. When you are with a living Master, whatsoever they do to prevent people will help us; whatsoever they do to prevent people is going to help people to come to us.\nAt a dance party, a young lady had just been introduced to her partner. By way of making conversation she said, “Who is that terribly ugly man?”\n“Why, that is my brother!” he exclaimed.\n“Ah, you must excuse me,” said the lady in embarrassment, and added apologetically, “I really had not noticed the resemblance.”\nDon’t be worried. Whatsoever they will try to do will make things worse for themselves.\nYou go and enjoy the trip. Laugh loudly. And I have been telling you so many jokes about the priests and the rabbis and the bishops and the popes. Find out the juiciest ones, because that is the best way to hit these people.\nThe rabbi: “What would you say if I asked you to marry me?” The girl: “Nothing – I can’t talk and laugh at the same time.”\nOnly stupid people are going to remain in the churches. Intelligent ones are bound to escape. Stupid people have their own ideas – idiotic are those ideas, but they try to fulfill them. And they have to be forgiven. If only stupid people are left in the churches, it is good. It is good for the world, too. They will remain engaged there in their prayers, they will remain engaged listening to all kinds of crap, and the world will be saved from them. Let them become nuns and priests and monks, and that will do immense good to humanity. Let them remain closed in their monasteries; that is a beautiful way to keep them off, away, far away, because they are contagious, they can infect others too. Stupidity is like cancer. Cancer maybe is curable, but stupidity seems to be incurable.\nOne psychiatrist was very happily married to a surprisingly ugly woman. “I know she is terribly homely,” he explained to a friend, “and slightly cross-eyed and a bit dull. But boy, what exciting nightmares she has!”\nHe is not interested in the woman, he is interested in her exciting nightmares. So let them, such kind of people, if they want to remain Christians and Hindus and Mohammedans, let them. We don’t want that kind to come here and pollute the air.\nThe father’s tone was severe as he said, “Young man, do you think you should be taking my daughter to nightclubs all the time?”\n“Certainly not,” the boy answered, then added hopefully, “let us try to reason with her.” You missed it!\nOnce you are caught by a girl, it is no more a question of your choice where you go. The boy is right; he says, “Let us try to reason with her.”\nThe second question:\nQuestion 2 OSHO,\nI AM NOT A DANCER, BUT I LOVE TO DANCE. AT TIMES I WOULD LIKE TO LEAP AND TWIRL AND STAY IN THE AIR. BUT, OSHO, I WORRY ABOUT ENLIGHTENMENT. DOES AN ENLIGHTENED MAN DANCE?\nCHRIS LANE,\nYou must have come from a Christian family so you don’t have any idea that enlightened people have been of all kinds. It is a spectrum, the whole rainbow.\nThere has been Krishna – the dancer, the flute-player, the singer. There has been Chaitanya – a mad dancer, he will dance and dance for hours, until he will fall in ecstasy; the joy will be so overflowing, uncontainable. There has been Jalaluddin Rumi who twirled – he became enlightened while twirling. He whirled for thirty-six hours continuously, non-stop; then he fell, exhausted by the ecstasy, and when he opened his eyes the old man was gone and the new has arrived. It is Jalaluddin Rumi who founded the whirling dervishes and their whole beautiful tradition. There has been Meera in India, who danced to abandon, who danced from one village to another village, almost covering the whole north of India.\nBut the Christians have only one idea – that of Christ. And they say Christ did not laugh either, what to say about dance? But I don’t believe that that is true. I know him far better than the Polack pope. He was a man of immense joy. He loved to eat, to drink even; he’s the only enlightened one who was not against wine. And in fact no enlightened person should be against wine, because it is pure vegetarian.\nHe loved to eat and stay late in the night eating, talking, gossiping. Christians have the idea that he was only delivering gospels; they have dropped all the gossips. In fact, those gossips contained more truth than the gospels that they have chosen, because in his gossips he was more really human. In gospels you become a little inhuman, you become dry. And he was a wet man, not a dry man at all. And can you think a man who drinks wine and moves with gamblers and prostitutes not gossiping? Impossible!\nNarada was one of the great enlightened persons in India who loved his veena, and played continuously his VEENA. Kabir loved to dance, sing; Dadu, Nanak all were lovers of singing. Nanak always used to have a companion because any time he would start singing, and he needed\nsomebody to play... so he had one companion continuously. His name was Mardana; because he was always ready with his instrument to accompany Nanak. In all his travels he was a masterplayer. Nanak at any moment will start singing, in the middle of the night, anywhere. Whenever the divine possessed him he will sing, and immediately Mardana will have to play.\nThere have been people like Buddha who never danced, Lao Tzu, who never danced, Bodhidharma, who never danced. But that does not mean that they were against dancing. My own understanding is that they had found a subtler dance of their inner being; there was no need for a physical dance. They were great dancers in that sense – far greater than Krishna, Chaitanya, Meera, Nanak, Kabir, Dadu... because the body was not moving, but their soul was dancing, their very being was in a dance.\nSo, Chris, you need not be afraid.\nYou say: I AM NOT A DANCER, BUT I LOVE TO DANCE. AT TIMES I WOULD LIKE TO LEAP AND TWIRL AND STAY IN THE AIR. BUT, OSHO, I WORRY ABOUT ENLIGHTENMENT. DOES AN ENLIGHTENED MAN DANCE?\nYou need not worry – just avoid J. Krishnamurti. One of my sannyasins, Yoga Suresh, has written:\nQuestion 3\nOSHO, RECENTLY J. KRISHNAMURTI WAS TALKING AT BOMBAY, AND I ALSO ATTENDED WITH A LOT OF MY SANNYASIN FRIENDS. ON THE VERY FIRST DAY, AFTER SITTING ON THE STAGE, HE TOOK ONE GLANCE AT US AND THEN SAID: “THIS IS NOT A PLACE OF AMUSEMENT, DANCE, MUSIC, AND ENJOYMENT. THEREFORE, IF ANYBODY HAS COME HERE FOR JOY OR SOMETHING ELSE, HE SHOULD LEAVE THE PREMISES RIGHT NOW.”\nHE HAS ALSO MENTIONED VERY OFTEN IN HIS TALKS THAT: “ALL FOREIGNERS WHO COME TO INDIA ARE TRAPPED BY THE SO-CALLED BHAGWAN, WHO GIVES THEM COLORED CLOTHES TO WEAR AND A NECKLACE OF BEADS OR A MALA, AND HE TEACHES THEM, THE IGNORANT WESTERN PEOPLE, TO SING AND DANCE TO HOLLYWOOD MUSIC, ET CETERA, ET CETERA. AND THEY CALL IT MEDITATION.”\nOSHO, AS YOU ALWAYS PRAISE HIM AND HIS TEACHINGS IN YOUR LECTURES, WHY DOES HE HAVE A GRUDGE AGAINST YOU? HE DOES NOT EVEN HAVE THE COURAGE TO SAY IT DIRECTLY TO YOU BY USING YOUR NAME AS YOU USE HIS NAME. WHY IS THIS SO?\nSo Chris, if you are worried about enlightenment, that what will happen, this is the only place where you need not be worried. But you will have to avoid people like J. Krishnamurti. He is too serious, so deadly serious, as if he has the responsibility to transform the whole world. He is carrying the burden, and he is becoming every day more and more angrier because nothing is happening. People still go on dancing, people still go on enjoying music, he said.\nAnd my sannyasins whenever they go to listen to him... And I say: Wherever he is, go! Just sit in the front row, and enjoy! Irritate him, annoy him, drive him crazy because I love that man. So I would like you also to love him.\nHe is a good man, nice, getting a little senile. That’s okay; he is old, we can forgive him. Red clothes just trigger something in him – like a red flag triggers something in a bull. Although he’s an old bull, but the moment you flag him with the red, he forgets his oldness; he becomes again young. And this is good, to bring new blood to the old man – he will live a little longer. Help him! In his past lives he must have been a Spanish bull.\nHe said, “This is not a place of amusement...” and I say to you, “This is a place of amusement, dance, music and enjoyment.” Because to me, life is not seriousness, life is not sadness. He’s too deadly serious, he cannot laugh. Jesus must have laughed, but Krishnamurti? – he cannot laugh.\nBut that too is an aspect, so I don’t say that he is not enlightened, remember. I will never say anything against him because to me enlightenment is a multidimensional phenomenon. He can say things against me, that’s okay, because his understanding of enlightenment is one-dimensional, linear. He thinks as if he is the criterion of enlightenment, that if somebody fits exactly with him, just like him, then he is enlightened. But that will simply mean that Jesus is not enlightened, that Buddha is not enlightened, that Krishna is not enlightened, that Zarathustra is not enlightened – because the first thing Zarathustra did as he moved out of the womb, he laughed. Now, that’s what my sannyasins should learn. Next time when you are around, coming out of the mother’s womb, have a good belly-laugh. Let that become the sign that a Rajneesh sannyasin is born again!\nZarathustra cannot be enlightened according to Krishnamurti. Lao Tzu cannot be enlightened, because he was a very non-serious man. He used to ride on a buffalo, and that too backwards – just to make everybody laugh. Just his passing from a town and a crowd will gather and they will start laughing: what is the matter?\nOnly one other Master – Sufi Master, Mulla Nasruddin – had done that, nobody else in the whole history of humanity. Iran has not been able to produce anybody better, higher, greater than Mulla Nasruddin. Nasruddin was going to visit a place, and his disciples were following him, and he was riding on his donkey; sitting backwards. A crowd started gathering; the disciples started feeling a little embarrassed, obviously. Nasruddin was enjoying, but the disciples were feeling embarrassed that, “What kind of a Master you have got? He does not even know how to sit on a donkey! In the first place he is sitting on a donkey; in the second place in a wrong way...”\nFinally one disciple gathered courage and asked, “Mulla, people are laughing and we are feeling embarrassed. What is the reason of your sitting backwards on the donkey?”\nMulla said, “A simple reason – the reason is not very complicated.” He said, “If I sit as usually people sit, then my back will be towards you. That will be disrespectful. I love you, I respect you; a real Master always respects his disciples.”\nA disciple suggested, “Then we can have some other arrangement: we can walk ahead of you.”\nHe said, “That is not right, because then your back will be towards me – that will be disrespectful towards the Master. And even if the Master is trying not to be disrespectful towards the disciples, how the disciples can be disrespectful to the Master? So this is the only possible way: I am facing you, you are facing me, and the journey is continuing, the donkey is going. Let the fools laugh, but we have our own philosophy and we have to live according to our philosophy.”\nLao Tzu never gave the reason – nobody knows why, but perhaps this was his reason too, because his disciples Chuang Tzu, Lieh Tzu, and others, were always following him, and he was making a laughing stock of everybody.\nKrishnamurti will not accept Lao Tzu as enlightened and certainly not Chuang Tzu, because Chuang Tzu will look very absurd to him. Chuang Tzu has written such absurd stories – that’s the only reason I love him. He is the most absurd Master in the whole world, before me... not after me! I am far more absurd. Even if Chuang Tzu comes here, he will feel a little hesitant whether to enter the Gateless Gate or not.\nKrishnamurti never uses anybody’s name – Buddha, Mahavira, Krishna, Christ, Zarathustra, Bodhidharma, Rinzai, Bokuju – never he uses anybody’s name, for the simple reason that he is a very one-dimensional man. He thinks he is the only criterion of enlightenment. Hence, he has no grudge against me – just his vision is very limited. His vision is a tunnel vision – perfectly right, through his tunnel he has seen the light, but through a tunnel.\nMy vision is immense: I can include him, he cannot include me. Hence he says, “Therefore if anybody has come here for joy or something else, he should leave the premises right now.” Whatsoever he says, never leave those premises! Be the first to enter and be the last to leave. And when he is talking against me, clap, enjoy, laugh. There is no reason why you should not enjoy! Whenever an enlightened person is available, one should enjoy as much as one can, one should eat as much as one can.\nAnd, to me, there is no difficulty.\nMany times the question has been asked to me that, “You never say anything against Krishnamurti, but he goes on saying things against you...?” Of course, he never mentions my name, but indirectly he is saying against me. He can say, still I don’t think that he has any grudge against me. His tunnel vision is the reason of it.\nBut this is not only his situation – Mahavira had a tunnel vision, Mohammed had a tunnel vision. In fact, very few people have been able to have multidimensional vision, for the simple reason that when you achieve enlightenment you achieve through a certain path, certain method, and you become obsessed with it; you think this is the only way. And you are right – this is a way, but not the only way.\nI had never had a Master in all my past lives, but I had been with many enlightened people. That has made my vision rich. I can understand Jesus as easily as Krishna. I can penetrate the very heart of Mahavira as easily as Buddha, because I have followed, accompanied many enlightened people down the ages. And I have never been a follower to anybody, otherwise I would have become obsessed with a tunnel vision. And I have seen Jalaluddin Rumi attaining to enlightenment through dancing, and I have seen Gautam Buddha sitting and attaining to enlightenment without dancing, and I have seen Krishna with sixteen thousand women – really enjoying Hollywood Music!\nAnd it is strange that Krishnamurti should say anything against Hollywood music, because he lives in the Hollywood area. In fact, I don’t know what is Hollywood music. He lives in Hollywood; maybe that’s why he has become anti-Hollywood-music. It is very difficult to forgive your neighbors.\nHe says: “All foreigners who come to India are trapped by the so-called Bhagwan...”\nThat is true! You can try and trap them – they are perfectly available. In fact, I send them to Krishnamurti’s meetings. If he can manage to trap them, I make them available. It is he himself who says to them, “Leave the premises right now.” He cannot trap my people, nobody can trap my people, because I am not trapping you. I am making you free from all traps.\nHe says: “The Bhagwan gives them colored clothes...” What is wrong with colored clothes? Just the past life, that Spanish bull life, a hangover...\n“And he gives them to wear a necklace of beads or mala.” What is wrong in it? It is just to irritate people like you, J. Krishnamurti, people who have a tunnel vision. so I put my people exactly at the other end of the tunnel, so whatsoever you can see are only orange people with a mala and my picture.\nAnd the moment he will see my picture, he is no more in his senses. That is the moment when he transcends his mind. That is an opportunity for him to go into meditation, otherwise he is a very rational man, very much tethered to the mind. Whatsoever he goes on saying is just mind-stuff. He has transcended the mind, but the way he expresses he uses his mind only.\nI am using many other devices too. I use the mind, I use the words, I use the silence, I use the music – yes, I can even use the Hollywood music and make you enlightened through it. That’s how the alchemist functions. This very life has to he used, and all that this life contains.\nI can send you to see a “blue movie” and tell you to just be a witness, don’t get identified, and it becomes a meditation. And the blue movie will be the right thing, because again and again you will forget to be a witness. And again and again you will have to he a witness. It will be a constant struggle. Just looking at a wall, anybody can become a witness.\nBodhidharma was looking at a wall for nine years. There is no wonder he became enlightened. What else can you do? He must have thought, “It is better now to become enlightened – at least to get rid of this wall.”\nIt is better to project a blue mt)vie on the wall and then be a witness. And I tell you, you will not take nine years, far quicker – you will be tired of all those naked women passing by.\nEverything can be used. That’s why I am against renunciation – everything in life can be used. Yes, even wine can be used. You can drink it, but in small quantities in the beginning, and remain alert – just a little quantity and then remain alert. Try to be alert when the wine starts functioning in you. If you can be alert with wine, then go on increasing the dose. One day you can drink the wine just like water and still you are alert. And if you can drink the whole bottle and remain alert, then nobody can make you unenlightened again. Impossible!\nThis has been used; this is not a new method. This has been used for centuries in India, from the days of the RIG VEDA; they called it soma-ras, it is the same. everything can be used. In fact, the more you have been taught to be against alcohol, against other drugs, the more you have become interested in them. And nobody teaches you how to use these drugs – alcohol, other intoxicants – to become alert, aware.\nIn a better world, in a more scientific world, every commune should have a small place with experts to give you small doses of intoxicant and help you to remain alert. And if you can remain alert while every possibility is of losing alertness, then in ordinary life you will be alert without any difficulty.\nSo, Chris, just avoid J. Krishnamurti, and that too only till you have become a sannyasin. Yet you are not a sannyasin; once you are a sannyasin there is no need to avoid anybody. Go to Krishnamurti, go anywhere. Let them avoid you!\nThis will be a great thing...\nHe never comes to Poona; he used to come in the past. This is the time, now he soul come – now the spring has come to Poona. He used to visit town when it was dead. Now he should come and I will send five thousand sannyasins and you will see that even an enlightened person dances. Of course. it will not be a very beautiful dance, but he will jump and scream, and hit his head. It will be some sort of dance, a little weird, something like jogging dynamic meditation. And when he is doing that, put a mala around his neck!\nThe last question:\nQuestion 4 OSHO,\nWHY ARE THE INDIANS SO INTOLERANT AND SO MUCH ANGRY AT YOU? RADHE,\nIt is very simple. They are very religious people, the only religious people in the world, very spiritual. This is the sign of their spirituality, their religiousness – the so-called religious always become fanatics. They talk about tolerance, but they are very intolerant. In fact, the very idea of becoming tolerant has the seed of intolerance in it.\nWhen somebody says,“Be tolerant,” that simply means there is intolerance. Why be tolerant? I am not tolerant, hence I need not be intolerant either. Why should I be tolerant or intolerant? They are two sides of the same coin. Rut these so-called religious people, these phony spiritualists, are bound to be intolerant because they are repressing their anger, their rage. They are boiling within.\nJust the other day I was seeing the newspapers. One article suggests – a very religious person who has written the article – that Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh should be given electroshocks. This is Indian culture, religiousness, nonviolence, celibacy, great heritage, the country of the great seers – asking the government to give me electroshocks.\nThe second article I saw yesterday was that I should be deported immediately. The third article was that the Indian government should throw me into the Arabian Ocean – not even in the Indian Ocean, because I may pollute the Indian Ocean. “Throw him in the Arabian Ocean, so if he pollutes, he pollutes the Arabs!”\nMy suggestion is: all these three things can be done together; there is no need to do separately. First, give me electroshocks, then deport me and don’t give me any passport, so of course I cannot go outside the country; and because you have deported me, then throw me into the Arabian Ocean. And this will save your country, your religion, your culture, your great heritage! This will prove to the world that you are really the gurus of the world, that the whole world needs your advice and your wisdom.\nRadhe, they are angry because I am not supporting their beliefs. They are against me because I am original, and they are always against anything that is original, because the original means anti-traditional, anti-conventional. And India has lived with borrowed knowledge for centuries.\nChandulal: “Good evening, thought I would drop in and see you about the umbrella you borrowed from me last week.”\nGaurilal: “I’m sorry, but I lent it to a friend of mine. Did you want it?”\nChandulal: “Well, not for myself, but the fellow I borrowed it from says the owner wants it.”\nThis is the way of the Indian mind – borrowing, borrowing. And the moment they see something new, they become afraid. It is their fear that becomes anger. Remember always, it is fear standing upside down that becomes anger – fear doing a headstand, sirshasan, becomes anger. Anger is just a security, because deep down they are feeling afraid.\nNot a single argument is said against me. Now, do you think these are arguments against me? – electroshocks, deportation, throwing into the Arabian Sea... these are arguments? Not a single argument is there. They are feeling very impotent, and out of their impotency great rage is arising.\nAnd they go on again and again asking me for many things. Pundit Lajjashankara Jha has asked two things:\nQuestion 5\nWHY ARE NOT THE INDIANS ALLOWED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE THERAPY GROUPS?\nSecond: ARE YOU BRAINWASHING THE INNOCENT WESTERNERS IN THE THERAPY GROUPS?\nFirst he wants to know why Indians are not allowed in the therapy groups. Will they understand therapy? Will they understand bringing all their repressed sexuality out? Will they be able to realize and recognize their ugliness? Will they be able to see in the mirror of therapy their original face?\nI am perfectly ready to allow them. Pundit Lajjashankara Jha can be allowed, but will he be ready to put his scholarship – he is a pundit, a brahmin – will he be able to put his past aside and go into a therapy group? Will he be ready to be really spiritually naked, truthful, honest? – because a therapy group can function only if you are authentic, if you say only that which you feel. But something else will happen: he will not say what he feels, he will say what is expected of him to say.\nJust the other day one sannyasin informed me that an Indian fell to her feet and started massaging her feet and telling her, “Mother, mother,” and then started taking his hand upwards. She stopped him but he will not listen, calling, “Mother!” and “Mother!” And he was trying to reach to her thighs, and “Mother” – this dual personality, saying “Mother” and trying to touch her naked body...\nIndians are not allowed for the simple reason that they cannot open themselves. They have become the most closed people in the world. Even if they cannot understand what I am saying here, how they can go into a really deep therapeutic situation? It will be impossible for them.\nAnd the second question shows his fear already:\nQuestion 6\nARE YOU BRAINWASHING THE WESTERN PEOPLE, THE INNOCENT PEOPLE IN THE THERAPY GROUPS?\nHis fear is there, that if he allows himself and opens up he will be brainwashed. Don’t be afraid, Pundit Lajjashankara Jha, because to be brain-washed one thing is absolutely needed – that is brain! How can I brainwash you? First you will have to have brain in there, then it can be washed. We will wash it clean, but first it has to be there.\nAnd he calls them, “innocent western people.” If they are innocent then there is no need to wash them. In fact, you need washing, but you don’t have the brain. They have the brain, but they don’t need washing. You see my troubles?\nThe Indians are angry with me because they hoped, expected that I will give more nourishment to their ego, and rather than giving nourishment to their ego I started shattering it to pieces. That’s what is hurting them – I am not fulfilling their expectations.\nThey will not say it clearly, but every day I see in newspapers. People write about me that, “When you were giving discourses on Srimad Bhagavad Gita, it was so beautiful! We had enjoyed it so much. When you were taking on Mahavira we had loved it. But now whatsoever you are doing, we hate it!”\nWhy they loved when I was talking on Bhagavad Gita? Because they felt that I am bringing the message of Krishna up to date, I am making it contemporary.\nDon’t be worried. Once the commune is settled I will again talk on Bhagavad Gita – and you will hate it, because then I will tell you the real truth. The last time I was just talking about the circumference of the Bhagavad Gita; now I will expose its reality, its nakedness, and then you will hate me more.\nBut you are asking it...\nDurga has her first date and comes home at two o’clock at night. “Where have you been?” the worried mother wants to know. “Oh, I went to a party with Prem,” she answers.\n“And then where did you go?” she wants to know. “We went to his room,” she says.\n“And what did you do there?” worried mum wants to know. “We had a drink, sat on the bed and talked.”\n“Darling, what then?” mum says, jumping up and down. “Then he asked me to close my eyes, and he undressed me.” “Darling, and then?” mum is nearly fainting.\n“Then he gave me a leotard and a pair of roller skates... and mum, why are you laughing?”\nTry to get it! Let me repeat: “Then he gave me a leotard and a pair of rolling skates... and mum, why are you laughing?”\nThe mother is waiting..some hidden expectation that now this is going to happen, now this is going to happen, now this is the last moment and it is going to happen... And suddenly it does not happen.\nThe Indians have been waiting for me, that I will go around the world spreading Indian religion and the message of the Vedas. Why should I do all that nonsense? When I can give my own message, why should I give anybody else’s message? The seers of the Vedas were not concerned with me, why I should be concerned with them? They never gave my message, why should I give their message?\nBut they have a very rotten language of understanding. They can understand only that which is written in their scriptures. They cannot understand anything else. Howsoever rotten it is... and much of it is bound to be rotten; the world has grown, man has come of age.\nA man went into a butcher’s shop and asked for half a pound of kidley. “I beg your pardon,” said the butcher.\n“I want half a pound of kidley.”\n“Say that again?” “Half a pound of kidley.”\n“Are you sure you don’t mean half a pound of kidney?” “That’s what I said, diddle l?”\nIt is a question of language.\nOnce a sannyasin asked an Indian in a chai shop for information. He said, “Excuse me, where can I buy some shampoo?”\nThe chaiwalla said, “You are from which country?” “Australia,” said the sannyasin.\n“America?” queried the Indian. “Not America – Australia!”\n“England? Germany? Oh, yes... Germany people very good. You are married or single?” “Not married,” said the swami. “But where can I buy some shampoo?”\n“What you want?” “Shampoo!”\n“For what you want this?”\n“To wash my balls!” snapped the sannyasin. “What do you think?” “Oh, oh yes,” he said, “you are a tourist or you are coming for study?” “l want to buy some shampoo!! Do you know where I can buy some?” “What? What you want?”\n“Shampoo!”\n“Oh yes, you can buy.” “But where can I buy it?” “In shop you can buy!” “Yes, but which shop?” “What you want?”\n\u003c Previous | Contents\n","wordCount":"8955","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_wild_geese_and_the_water/part14/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_wild_geese_and_the_water/>The Wild Geese and the Water</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">14 The Bird has Flown</h1><div class=post-meta>43 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;8955 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Wild_Geese_and_the_Water/part14.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part13>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a></p><p><span id=bookmark13>‌</span>CHAPTER <span class=s3>14</span></p><p><br></p><p>The Bird has Flown</p><p><br></p><p>24 February 1981 am in Buddha Hall</p><p><br></p><p>The first question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 1 OSHO,</p><p>THE DUTCH TELEVISION HAS ASKED ME TO PARTICIPATE IN A PROGRAM. ONE OF
THE QUESTIONS ON WHICH THEY WANT ME TO SPEAK IS AS FOLLOWS: WHAT IS
LACKING IN THE CHRISTIAN CHURCHES THAT IS ATTRACTING SO MANY YOUNG
PEOPLE TO THE NEW RELIGIOUS MOVEMENTS?</p><p><br></p><p>DEVA OJAS,</p><p><br></p><p>The christ is missing...</p><p><br></p><p>The Christian churches are there but they are just containers without
the content, utterly empty, a lamp whose light has gone out long before,
a cage – perhaps a golden cage – but the bird has flown and it sings no
more.</p><p><br></p><p>Missing of the Christ is bound to attract new people into new
adventures. It is always the young ones who find the real Masters. The
old ones settle with the establishment, their vested interests are such.
And if once in a while an old person gets into enquiry for the truth –
even though it goes against his tradition, convention, belief – then
that old man is old only physically; psychologically, spiritually he is
young.</p><p>Ojas, remind your people back in Holland that who were the people who
were attracted towards Jesus himself. Were they old? Were they young?
And what was missing in the Jewish religion? Why they were attracted to
Christ?</p><p><br></p><p>They were all young people; Jesus himself was very young. He died
only when he was thirty-three and the people who had come to him were
almost of his age. What was the reason? Begin your answer from there.
Why they left the Jewish church? It has a long tradition from Abraham
Moses Ezekiel, so many prophets, a beautiful scripture, the old
Testament, a great system of theology and philosophy... Why they left
all that behind and followed this carpenter’s son, uneducated? What was
the reason?</p><p><br></p><p>The reason was that he had attained the ultimate in consciousness he
has become a Christ. Remember Christ has nothing to do with Jesus as
such. Jesus is the individual and the phenomenon of Christ-consciousness
is universal. It has happened to many people before Jesus and to many
people after Jesus; Jesus is only one of the Christs.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha is a Christ Zarathustra is a Christ, Lao Tzu is a Christ and
there have been many many Christs after Jesus: Bodhidharma Lin Chi Kabir
Nanak – the long long river of Christ- consciousness continues. and the
young, the fresh will always be seeking for the Christ, for the
Christ-consciousness. So wherever the young people find the taste of
living Christ-consciousness, they are bound to go there. They are going
to risk everything.</p><p><br></p><p>In the Christian churches everything is there, one the bridegroom is
missing. All the guests are there, the celebration is perfectly ready to
start but the bridegroom is missing. So only the old who have become
almost blind – blind because of their conditioning – will not be able to
see that this whole thing is just false, pseudo. Now instead of Christ
they will find the Polack pope, who is just making stupid gestures.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the other day he landed in a small country which is occupied by
the Americans, forcibly. The American government had made every
arrangement, security arrangement, for him. A car was flown from America
to take him from the airport to his residence – just six kilometers, and
highly guarded security arrangement was made for him. He descended from
the airplane, a special airplane that was only caring for him – a big
jetliner carrying just one Polack.</p><p><br></p><p>And he talked about the dignity of the poor He descended from the
airplane and kissed the earth – these are empty gestures – and he said
that “I love your country so much that I kiss its very earth. But he
didn’t talk about freedom. He loves the country so much... then why he
didn’t talk about the freedom of the people? Why he did not say
something against the people who are ruling the country forcibly? – who
are occupying it? – who have made it a military base.</p><p><br></p><p>He didn’t talk about freedom. He talked about the beautiful country
but he didn’t talk about the ugly imperialism. He was not received by
any representative of the country; he was received by a special agent of
the American president who had come just before him to receive him on
behalf of Ronald Reagan.</p><p><br></p><p>And he kissed the earth – that he goes on doing everywhere, kissing
the earth. Impotent gestures. Talking about the dignity of the poor, and
living in richness. These hypocrites are the people who have to be
avoided – and the young can see...</p><p>I talk about the dignity of being rich. There is no dignity in being
poor, because if there is dignity in being poor, then there is dignity
in being a slave too, then there is dignity in being sick too, then
there is dignity in being starved too, undernourished too. These are all
part of poverty.</p><p><br></p><p>I talk about the dignity of the rich. One should be rich on the
outside and on the inside both. There is no need to divide the outside
and the inside – they are all one. And one should live as richly as
possible! That shows intelligence. Why talk about the dignity of the
poor? Why not destroy poverty? Why console poor people? Why tell them
that “You are the children of God, special children of God”? If the poor
are the children of God, then what are the rich? – the children of the
devil? Then it is better to belong to devil than to God; then let him
have his poor children and their dignity. But then the Pope will be a
son of the devil because he is one of the richest persons in the
world.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, living in luxury and talking about the dignity of the poor is
hypocrisy. Live the way you would like everybody to live. Live according
to your own understanding, but don’t be pretenders. The young can see
it, only the young can see it.</p><p><br></p><p>You must have come across the beautiful parable... I love it:</p><p><br></p><p>A very great king was visited by a cunning, clever priest. All
priests are clever and cunning, otherwise they cannot be priests.
Prostitutes may be innocent, but priests are never innocent. In fact,
only innocent girls become prostitutes. Very cunning people become
priests; it is the most cunning business.</p><p><br></p><p>The priest came to the king and said that, “You have conquered the
whole world. Now only one thing is missing, and unless you have that you
will remain discontented.”</p><p><br></p><p>The king was surprised, because actually that was the case: he was
feeling discontented. Every successful man feels discontented. The
failures can always hope, the successful cannot hope any more – he has
succeeded! You have heard the proverb that nothing fails like failure. I
say it is all wrong. I say to you: nothing fails like success. Once you
have succeeded you can see the futility of it. The riches are there, the
power is there, but you are as empty as before, or maybe now you feel
your emptiness more in contrast to the richness, to the power, to the
success that you have achieved. Now it hurts even more. And there is no
hope either – there is no tomorrow any more. You have achieved
whatsoever is possible to achieve so you cannot dream, you cannot
fantasize.</p><p><br></p><p>The king was feeling discontented – because he has conquered the
whole world. He was very much surprised, and trusted this priest, that
he has some miraculous powers: “He has read my mind. I have not told to
anybody that I am feeling discontented. How he has come to know?”</p><p><br></p><p>He took him into his private chamber and said,</p><p><br></p><p>“How you managed to find it out? I have never told to anybody, not
even to my wife. I go on pretending that I am immensely contented and
happy.”</p><p><br></p><p>All successful people do that. What is the point of saying it to
everybody? They will simply laugh, that “You are a fool!” They will say
that “We had told you before but you never listened,” so it is better to
keep quiet.</p><p>“How did you manage to know?”</p><p><br></p><p>The priest said, “I can read your thoughts, and I know what is
missing. If you can get special clothes of the angels, then you will be
immensely happy.”</p><p><br></p><p>A new desire, a new hope... tomorrow again became alive.</p><p><br></p><p>The king said, “I am ready. But how to get clothes from heaven? What
is the way?”</p><p><br></p><p>The priest said, “Everything I will do. I know the way, I know the
whole map, but it will cost you much. It is not an easy thing. It is for
the first time in the whole history of humanity that you will be getting
divine clothes; you may be the first and the last. And I will have to
bribe the angels, persuade somebody to steal, and then I have to fly to
heaven and come back... It is a long journey and dangerous too, but for
you I am ready to do it.”</p><p><br></p><p>The king said, “Don’t be worried about the money. But remember one
thing: don’t try to cheat me, otherwise death will be the only reward
for you. So you can have a palace to yourself; do whatsoever you want to
do, but you will be guarded, you cannot leave the palace. And whatsoever
money you want, you simply send a message and the money will be
delivered to you.”</p><p><br></p><p>And the priest started asking millions of rupees everyday. But the
king had enough. Within three weeks the priest informed that, “The
clothes have arrived. A great celebration should be arranged, people
should be informed. The whole capital should be decorated with lights,
fireworks, balloons, because something absolutely extraordinary is
happening.”</p><p><br></p><p>And the king did as he was told, and the whole court was waiting with
great silence. And the man came with a beautiful box, golden box. He
opened the box... but before opening the box, he said to the court that,
“One thing I should remind you: I have been told by the angels that
these clothes can be seen only by those who are born of their own
fathers – no bastard can see these clothes. Remember that.”</p><p><br></p><p>Then he opened the box – the box was empty. The king looked in, the
viziers looked in, and everybody started praising the clothes. Who wants
to be called a bastard? Everybody knew that the box is empty, but when
others were praising the clothes, everybody thought within his own
heart, “It is better to keep absolutely mum. It seems that I am not the
son of my father. Only I am not the son of my father, because everybody
else is seeing the clothes.”</p><p><br></p><p>And when the king saw that, “All the viziers and the courtiers and
the queen, everybody is seeing the clothes, so what is the point now
saying that I don’t see?” – he also started praising the clothes. There
was great rejoicing, and the crafty priest told the king, “Now give your
clothes one by one to me and I will give you the divine clothes.”</p><p><br></p><p>His coat was taken, his shirt was taken, his turban was taken... And
he was handed nothing, just nothing! Just the gesture, empty gesture. A
turban was placed on his head which didn’t exist at all. He was looking
silly to his own eyes. The shirt has disappeared, then he was afraid...
then the pants disappeared, then he was standing just with his
underpants, afraid: “Now what this man is going to do?” And everybody
was clapping and shouting with joy, that “Our king has got divine
clothes! How beautiful they look!”</p><p>Then the crafty priest asked for the underpants. For a moment the
king hesitated, but now it was too late. Now to say that “I don’t see,”
will be very illogical. Up to now you were seeing – what happened?
Suddenly you are not the son of your father? He had to give –
reluctantly, but he had to give. He had given his underpants also, now
he was standing absolutely naked, just like a Jaina monk. And everybody
was clapping and shouting with joy, and people started dancing. And
everybody was trying to defeat everybody else, so it is known to
everybody that, “I am the son of my own father far more than you are.”
It was a great competition.</p><p><br></p><p>And then the crafty priest said that, “Thousands of people are
waiting outside the palace. The chariot is ready. Now, sir, you come! A
procession has to be taken. The whole capital is waiting. Many many
people have gathered from all over the place to see the divine
clothes.”</p><p><br></p><p>Again he felt for a moment very hesitant: “But if everybody is seeing
the clothes, then there is no fear really. Only I am not seeing, but
that is not the point. I already know,” he thought, “that I am naked. I
know my nakedness and everybody is seeing so there is no fear.”</p><p><br></p><p>He went into the chariot. Everybody, millions of people, saw he was
naked, but just before the chariot it was continuously announced that
these clothes are divine and can be seen only by those who are born of
their own others. So everybody was shouting, clapping, dancing... it was
such a rejoicing,.</p><p><br></p><p>Just a small child sitting on his father’s shoulders told the father,
“Daddy, the king seems to be naked.”</p><p><br></p><p>The father said, “Shut up! When you will grow then you will see. You
are just a child, you don’t understand.”</p><p><br></p><p>But again and again the child said, “But father, I can see everything
– only the clothes I cannot see. I can see you, I can see the naked
king, the chariot, the horses, millions of people. And just for the
clothes I have first to become grown-up?”</p><p><br></p><p>And the father said, “You keep absolutely silent. You don’t
understand. It takes time. One has to be adult, at least twenty-one
years – when you have the right to vote, that is the time when you start
seeing the clothes. Wait!” And fearing that somebody may hear, he took
the child away. That was the only person there in the crowd who could
see that the king was naked. Everybody was seeing, but only a child can
say it as it is.</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus was recognized only by innocent people. The rabbis killed him.
Now, the same rabbis have become popes, bishops, priests – the same
rabbis. It is the same business. It was done in the name of Jewism, now
it is done in the name of Christianity.</p><p><br></p><p>Christ is missing, Deva Ojas, that is the first thing to be
remembered.</p><p><br></p><p>You ask me: WHAT IS LACKING IN THE CHRISTIAN CHURCHES THAT IS
ATTRACTING SO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE TO THE NEW RELIGIOUS MOVEMENTS?</p><p><br></p><p>The second thing is that Christianity or Hinduism or Mohammedanism or
Jainism or Buddhism are not your choice. You are born into a certain
family which is accidental – then you are conditioned.</p><p>It is a conditioning. The first disciples of Jesus were not born
Christians, they had chosen it. And when one chooses out of one’s own
intelligence and freedom, it is a totally different matter. And when
something is imposed upon you it is nothing but an imprisonment.</p><p><br></p><p>Now churches are nothing but jails. And for that matter, not only
Christian churches, all the churches. Only when a living Master is there
and his presence triggers a process of enlightenment in you, triggers a
process of transformation in you, and you choose because of that
process, then you are really religious. Otherwise these are all pseudo
people: Christians, Hindus, Parsees, Sikhs – all pseudo.</p><p><br></p><p>The people who had chosen Nanak were a totally different people; they
had risked their life. The people who went with Mohammed were REAL
Muslims, they risked everything. Being with Mohammed was not an easy
job, it was risking your life, your very head; now to be a Mohammedan is
convenient, comfortable. To be a Hindu costs nothing.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, before you ever become conscious you are already
conditioned, your unconscious is already stuffed with all kinds of
superstitions.</p><p><br></p><p>If the younger people are moving to new religious movements, the
reason is because only the new is religious; the old is always a cult.
Christianity is a cult! But is is a very strange thing: Christians call
new religious movements cults, sects – they are religious. Just the
opposite is the truth: anything which is very old is only a cult, a
sect. When Jesus is alive there is religion. When Buddha is alive there
is religion. When Buddha is gone there is only left a cult.</p><p><br></p><p>A cult is the corpse of a religion. A cult is only the footprints of
the Buddhas on the sands of time. Buddhas disappear in the timelessness,
and on the sands of time the footprints are worshipped, as if those
footprints are Buddhas.</p><p><br></p><p>I say to you that religion exists only in the presence of a Master.
The moment the Master leaves, the religion disappears.</p><p><br></p><p>It is just like the fragrance of a rose flower. The moment the rose
flower disappears, its petals start falling back to the soil, the
fragrance also disappears. Religion is the fragrance of the person who
has become awakened. It cannot be caught into churches – you cannot
catch hold of a fragrance. Even if you keep the dead flower – as people
love to keep in their Bibles, roses they keep between their Bible pages
– by and by they become dry, they lose all fragrance. Just they give you
a sense that once there was a flower, those dry flowers, dead
flowers.</p><p><br></p><p>Young people are always searching for something alive; that’s what
youth is all about. So whosoever is young, whether physically or
spiritually, will always seek a Christ – wherever he can find, in
whatsoever form he can find, he will find a Christ. Unless he finds a
Christ he will not feel contented. And no church can be a substitute for
a Christ.</p><p><br></p><p>One has to choose the religion. And these Christians, these
Mohammedans, these Hindus, they have not chosen. It has been imposed on
them. And remember, if you choose on your own, even the hell, then it is
heaven, and if you are thrown in heaven forcibly, then it is hell. My
definition of hell and heaven depends on freedom: if it is freedom, then
it is heaven if it is not freedom, then it is hell.</p><p>The churches are against the individual, and the young people are
always searching for individuality. And it is one of the intrinsic parts
of youth, youthfulness, to search for authentic individuality. The
churches belong to the collective mob psychology and they have fallen
down to the mob psychology They fulfill the expectations of the
marketplace. They fulfill the expectations of the sleepy people,
somnambulists, they cannot help you to be awakened. Only a person who
never fulfills your demands, who lives in his own light without caring
about what the crowds say about him... Do you think Jesus in any way
cared about what the crowds were saying about him? If he had cared, he
would not have been crucified, he would have been given a Nobel prize,
he would have been a Nobel laureate like Mother Teresa of Calcutta.</p><p><br></p><p>He is crucified, and this Mother Teresa becomes a Nobel laureate.
There seems to be no connection between Mother Teresa and Jesus Christ.
There is certainly a connection between Jesus Christ and Al-Hillaj
Mansoor. There is certainly a connection between Jesus Christ and me. I
can be crucified any day. The crowd is against me – the crowd has always
been against the Buddhas, but Mother Teresa fulfills the expectations of
the crowd. Only stupid people can fulfill your expectations.</p><p><br></p><p>I have always been wondering, because I have come across two persons,
Morarji Desai and Mother Teresa... And I had always been a lit e puzzled
who is more stupid. They both seem to be greater than the other, bigger
than the other. But then, finally, Nobel prize decided. Mother Teresa
came first, Morarji Desai is second in the race. She fulfilled more the
mob psychology and its expectations,</p><p><br></p><p>Jesus is crucified, Socrates is murdered. Many attempts were made on
Buddha’s life. Mahavira was tortured in every possible way...</p><p><br></p><p>The young people are searching for freedom, for intelligence. The
young people are searching for rebellion, for revolution, for a radical
change. The church has been too heavy on their being, it is like a
mountain-load. They want to throw it, but they don’t know how to do it.
Unless they come across a person who has done it, who has thrown all the
nonsense of the past... only he can help you to be unburdened.</p><p><br></p><p>That’s why young people, Ojas, are searching new religious
movements.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember, this television series in Holland is arranged by the
Christians. They are becoming more and more afraid, they are becoming
more and more worried. And why they have asked Ojas to come? They are
going to pay him the fare and all the expenses from Poona to Amsterdam.
Why? – because Ojas is an ex-priest. And they are becoming much worried.
Even priests are becoming Rajneesh sannyasins! It is too dangerous. They
have to find out what are the reasons, so they can manage some way to
prevent. But you have to tell them the truth as it is, utterly naked.
Hammer it on their head.</p><p><br></p><p>Their effort is to find out the reason so they can prevent others
from escaping. And you should make every effort so that even others can
escape, because there are many many nuns, many many monks, many priests,
who want to escape from the slavery, but they don’t know how to do
it.</p><p><br></p><p>So use this opportunity. Don’t miss the opportunity. Don’t be polite
– be true. Say the truth as it is. Say that the king is naked, say that
Christ is no more in the Christian churches, say that “We have found
Christ somewhere else, that’s why we are going.” In fact, you are REAL
Christians, they are bogus Christians.</p><p>But priests are certainly very cunning people.</p><p><br></p><p>At the airport a flustered young rabbi starting on his honeymoon
absent-mindedly asked for one ticket to the Bahamas. But when his wife
pointed out his error, he answered without a moment’s hesitation, “By
Thunder! You are right, dear. I had forgotten myself completely!”</p><p><br></p><p>Priests are very clever and cunning. But don’t be worried about them.
When you are with a living Master, whatsoever they do to prevent people
will help us; whatsoever they do to prevent people is going to help
people to come to us.</p><p><br></p><p>At a dance party, a young lady had just been introduced to her
partner. By way of making conversation she said, “Who is that terribly
ugly man?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Why, that is my brother!” he exclaimed.</p><p><br></p><p>“Ah, you must excuse me,” said the lady in embarrassment, and added
apologetically, “I really had not noticed the resemblance.”</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t be worried. Whatsoever they will try to do will make things
worse for themselves.</p><p><br></p><p>You go and enjoy the trip. Laugh loudly. And I have been telling you
so many jokes about the priests and the rabbis and the bishops and the
popes. Find out the juiciest ones, because that is the best way to hit
these people.</p><p><br></p><p>The rabbi: “What would you say if I asked you to marry me?” The girl:
“Nothing – I can’t talk and laugh at the same time.”</p><p>Only stupid people are going to remain in the churches. Intelligent
ones are bound to escape. Stupid people have their own ideas – idiotic
are those ideas, but they try to fulfill them. And they have to be
forgiven. If only stupid people are left in the churches, it is good. It
is good for the world, too. They will remain engaged there in their
prayers, they will remain engaged listening to all kinds of crap, and
the world will be saved from them. Let them become nuns and priests and
monks, and that will do immense good to humanity. Let them remain closed
in their monasteries; that is a beautiful way to keep them off, away,
far away, because they are contagious, they can infect others too.
Stupidity is like cancer. Cancer maybe is curable, but stupidity seems
to be incurable.</p><p><br></p><p>One psychiatrist was very happily married to a surprisingly ugly
woman. “I know she is terribly homely,” he explained to a friend, “and
slightly cross-eyed and a bit dull. But boy, what exciting nightmares
she has!”</p><p><br></p><p>He is not interested in the woman, he is interested in her exciting
nightmares. So let them, such kind of people, if they want to remain
Christians and Hindus and Mohammedans, let them. We don’t want that kind
to come here and pollute the air.</p><p><br></p><p>The father’s tone was severe as he said, “Young man, do you think you
should be taking my daughter to nightclubs all the time?”</p><p>“Certainly not,” the boy answered, then added hopefully, “let us try
to reason with her.” You missed it!</p><p>Once you are caught by a girl, it is no more a question of your
choice where you go. The boy is right; he says, “Let us try to reason
with her.”</p><p><br></p><p>The second question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 2 OSHO,</p><p>I AM NOT A DANCER, BUT I LOVE TO DANCE. AT TIMES I WOULD LIKE TO LEAP
AND TWIRL AND STAY IN THE AIR. BUT, OSHO, I WORRY ABOUT ENLIGHTENMENT.
DOES AN ENLIGHTENED MAN DANCE?</p><p><br></p><p>CHRIS LANE,</p><p><br></p><p>You must have come from a Christian family so you don’t have any idea
that enlightened people have been of all kinds. It is a spectrum, the
whole rainbow.</p><p><br></p><p>There has been Krishna – the dancer, the flute-player, the singer.
There has been Chaitanya – a mad dancer, he will dance and dance for
hours, until he will fall in ecstasy; the joy will be so overflowing,
uncontainable. There has been Jalaluddin Rumi who twirled – he became
enlightened while twirling. He whirled for thirty-six hours
continuously, non-stop; then he fell, exhausted by the ecstasy, and when
he opened his eyes the old man was gone and the new has arrived. It is
Jalaluddin Rumi who founded the whirling dervishes and their whole
beautiful tradition. There has been Meera in India, who danced to
abandon, who danced from one village to another village, almost covering
the whole north of India.</p><p><br></p><p>But the Christians have only one idea – that of Christ. And they say
Christ did not laugh either, what to say about dance? But I don’t
believe that that is true. I know him far better than the Polack pope.
He was a man of immense joy. He loved to eat, to drink even; he’s the
only enlightened one who was not against wine. And in fact no
enlightened person should be against wine, because it is pure
vegetarian.</p><p><br></p><p>He loved to eat and stay late in the night eating, talking,
gossiping. Christians have the idea that he was only delivering gospels;
they have dropped all the gossips. In fact, those gossips contained more
truth than the gospels that they have chosen, because in his gossips he
was more really human. In gospels you become a little inhuman, you
become dry. And he was a wet man, not a dry man at all. And can you
think a man who drinks wine and moves with gamblers and prostitutes not
gossiping? Impossible!</p><p><br></p><p>Narada was one of the great enlightened persons in India who loved
his veena, and played continuously his VEENA. Kabir loved to dance,
sing; Dadu, Nanak all were lovers of singing. Nanak always used to have
a companion because any time he would start singing, and he needed</p><p>somebody to play... so he had one companion continuously. His name
was Mardana; because he was always ready with his instrument to
accompany Nanak. In all his travels he was a masterplayer. Nanak at any
moment will start singing, in the middle of the night, anywhere.
Whenever the divine possessed him he will sing, and immediately Mardana
will have to play.</p><p>There have been people like Buddha who never danced, Lao Tzu, who
never danced, Bodhidharma, who never danced. But that does not mean that
they were against dancing. My own understanding is that they had found a
subtler dance of their inner being; there was no need for a physical
dance. They were great dancers in that sense – far greater than Krishna,
Chaitanya, Meera, Nanak, Kabir, Dadu... because the body was not moving,
but their soul was dancing, their very being was in a dance.</p><p>So, Chris, you need not be afraid.</p><p><br></p><p>You say: I AM NOT A DANCER, BUT I LOVE TO DANCE. AT TIMES I WOULD
LIKE TO LEAP AND TWIRL AND STAY IN THE AIR. BUT, OSHO, I WORRY ABOUT
ENLIGHTENMENT. DOES AN ENLIGHTENED MAN DANCE?</p><p>You need not worry – just avoid J. Krishnamurti. One of my
sannyasins, Yoga Suresh, has written:</p><p>Question 3</p><p><br></p><p>OSHO, RECENTLY J. KRISHNAMURTI WAS TALKING AT BOMBAY, AND I ALSO
ATTENDED WITH A LOT OF MY SANNYASIN FRIENDS. ON THE VERY FIRST DAY,
AFTER SITTING ON THE STAGE, HE TOOK ONE GLANCE AT US AND THEN SAID:
“THIS IS NOT A PLACE OF AMUSEMENT, DANCE, MUSIC, AND ENJOYMENT.
THEREFORE, IF ANYBODY HAS COME HERE FOR JOY OR SOMETHING ELSE, HE SHOULD
LEAVE THE PREMISES RIGHT NOW.”</p><p>HE HAS ALSO MENTIONED VERY OFTEN IN HIS TALKS THAT: “ALL FOREIGNERS
WHO COME TO INDIA ARE TRAPPED BY THE SO-CALLED BHAGWAN, WHO GIVES THEM
COLORED CLOTHES TO WEAR AND A NECKLACE OF BEADS OR A MALA, AND HE
TEACHES THEM, THE IGNORANT WESTERN PEOPLE, TO SING AND DANCE TO
HOLLYWOOD MUSIC, ET CETERA, ET CETERA. AND THEY CALL IT MEDITATION.”</p><p>OSHO, AS YOU ALWAYS PRAISE HIM AND HIS TEACHINGS IN YOUR LECTURES,
WHY DOES HE HAVE A GRUDGE AGAINST YOU? HE DOES NOT EVEN HAVE THE COURAGE
TO SAY IT DIRECTLY TO YOU BY USING YOUR NAME AS YOU USE HIS NAME. WHY IS
THIS SO?</p><p>So Chris, if you are worried about enlightenment, that what will
happen, this is the only place where you need not be worried. But you
will have to avoid people like J. Krishnamurti. He is too serious, so
deadly serious, as if he has the responsibility to transform the whole
world. He is carrying the burden, and he is becoming every day more and
more angrier because nothing is happening. People still go on dancing,
people still go on enjoying music, he said.</p><p>And my sannyasins whenever they go to listen to him... And I say:
Wherever he is, go! Just sit in the front row, and enjoy! Irritate him,
annoy him, drive him crazy because I love that man. So I would like you
also to love him.</p><p>He is a good man, nice, getting a little senile. That’s okay; he is
old, we can forgive him. Red clothes just trigger something in him –
like a red flag triggers something in a bull. Although he’s an old bull,
but the moment you flag him with the red, he forgets his oldness; he
becomes again young. And this is good, to bring new blood to the old man
– he will live a little longer. Help him! In his past lives he must have
been a Spanish bull.</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “This is not a place of amusement...” and I say to you,
“This is a place of amusement, dance, music and enjoyment.” Because to
me, life is not seriousness, life is not sadness. He’s too deadly
serious, he cannot laugh. Jesus must have laughed, but Krishnamurti? –
he cannot laugh.</p><p><br></p><p>But that too is an aspect, so I don’t say that he is not enlightened,
remember. I will never say anything against him because to me
enlightenment is a multidimensional phenomenon. He can say things
against me, that’s okay, because his understanding of enlightenment is
one-dimensional, linear. He thinks as if he is the criterion of
enlightenment, that if somebody fits exactly with him, just like him,
then he is enlightened. But that will simply mean that Jesus is not
enlightened, that Buddha is not enlightened, that Krishna is not
enlightened, that Zarathustra is not enlightened – because the first
thing Zarathustra did as he moved out of the womb, he laughed. Now,
that’s what my sannyasins should learn. Next time when you are around,
coming out of the mother’s womb, have a good belly-laugh. Let that
become the sign that a Rajneesh sannyasin is born again!</p><p><br></p><p>Zarathustra cannot be enlightened according to Krishnamurti. Lao Tzu
cannot be enlightened, because he was a very non-serious man. He used to
ride on a buffalo, and that too backwards – just to make everybody
laugh. Just his passing from a town and a crowd will gather and they
will start laughing: what is the matter?</p><p><br></p><p>Only one other Master – Sufi Master, Mulla Nasruddin – had done that,
nobody else in the whole history of humanity. Iran has not been able to
produce anybody better, higher, greater than Mulla Nasruddin. Nasruddin
was going to visit a place, and his disciples were following him, and he
was riding on his donkey; sitting backwards. A crowd started gathering;
the disciples started feeling a little embarrassed, obviously. Nasruddin
was enjoying, but the disciples were feeling embarrassed that, “What
kind of a Master you have got? He does not even know how to sit on a
donkey! In the first place he is sitting on a donkey; in the second
place in a wrong way...”</p><p><br></p><p>Finally one disciple gathered courage and asked, “Mulla, people are
laughing and we are feeling embarrassed. What is the reason of your
sitting backwards on the donkey?”</p><p><br></p><p>Mulla said, “A simple reason – the reason is not very complicated.”
He said, “If I sit as usually people sit, then my back will be towards
you. That will be disrespectful. I love you, I respect you; a real
Master always respects his disciples.”</p><p><br></p><p>A disciple suggested, “Then we can have some other arrangement: we
can walk ahead of you.”</p><p><br></p><p>He said, “That is not right, because then your back will be towards
me – that will be disrespectful towards the Master. And even if the
Master is trying not to be disrespectful towards the disciples, how the
disciples can be disrespectful to the Master? So this is the only
possible way: I am facing you, you are facing me, and the journey is
continuing, the donkey is going. Let the fools laugh, but we have our
own philosophy and we have to live according to our philosophy.”</p><p>Lao Tzu never gave the reason – nobody knows why, but perhaps this
was his reason too, because his disciples Chuang Tzu, Lieh Tzu, and
others, were always following him, and he was making a laughing stock of
everybody.</p><p><br></p><p>Krishnamurti will not accept Lao Tzu as enlightened and certainly not
Chuang Tzu, because Chuang Tzu will look very absurd to him. Chuang Tzu
has written such absurd stories – that’s the only reason I love him. He
is the most absurd Master in the whole world, before me... not after me!
I am far more absurd. Even if Chuang Tzu comes here, he will feel a
little hesitant whether to enter the Gateless Gate or not.</p><p><br></p><p>Krishnamurti never uses anybody’s name – Buddha, Mahavira, Krishna,
Christ, Zarathustra, Bodhidharma, Rinzai, Bokuju – never he uses
anybody’s name, for the simple reason that he is a very one-dimensional
man. He thinks he is the only criterion of enlightenment. Hence, he has
no grudge against me – just his vision is very limited. His vision is a
tunnel vision – perfectly right, through his tunnel he has seen the
light, but through a tunnel.</p><p><br></p><p>My vision is immense: I can include him, he cannot include me. Hence
he says, “Therefore if anybody has come here for joy or something else,
he should leave the premises right now.” Whatsoever he says, never leave
those premises! Be the first to enter and be the last to leave. And when
he is talking against me, clap, enjoy, laugh. There is no reason why you
should not enjoy! Whenever an enlightened person is available, one
should enjoy as much as one can, one should eat as much as one can.</p><p><br></p><p>And, to me, there is no difficulty.</p><p><br></p><p>Many times the question has been asked to me that, “You never say
anything against Krishnamurti, but he goes on saying things against
you...?” Of course, he never mentions my name, but indirectly he is
saying against me. He can say, still I don’t think that he has any
grudge against me. His tunnel vision is the reason of it.</p><p><br></p><p>But this is not only his situation – Mahavira had a tunnel vision,
Mohammed had a tunnel vision. In fact, very few people have been able to
have multidimensional vision, for the simple reason that when you
achieve enlightenment you achieve through a certain path, certain
method, and you become obsessed with it; you think this is the only way.
And you are right – this is a way, but not the only way.</p><p><br></p><p>I had never had a Master in all my past lives, but I had been with
many enlightened people. That has made my vision rich. I can understand
Jesus as easily as Krishna. I can penetrate the very heart of Mahavira
as easily as Buddha, because I have followed, accompanied many
enlightened people down the ages. And I have never been a follower to
anybody, otherwise I would have become obsessed with a tunnel vision.
And I have seen Jalaluddin Rumi attaining to enlightenment through
dancing, and I have seen Gautam Buddha sitting and attaining to
enlightenment without dancing, and I have seen Krishna with sixteen
thousand women – really enjoying Hollywood Music!</p><p><br></p><p>And it is strange that Krishnamurti should say anything against
Hollywood music, because he lives in the Hollywood area. In fact, I
don’t know what is Hollywood music. He lives in Hollywood; maybe that’s
why he has become anti-Hollywood-music. It is very difficult to forgive
your neighbors.</p><p>He says: “All foreigners who come to India are trapped by the
so-called Bhagwan...”</p><p><br></p><p>That is true! You can try and trap them – they are perfectly
available. In fact, I send them to Krishnamurti’s meetings. If he can
manage to trap them, I make them available. It is he himself who says to
them, “Leave the premises right now.” He cannot trap my people, nobody
can trap my people, because I am not trapping you. I am making you free
from all traps.</p><p><br></p><p>He says: “The Bhagwan gives them colored clothes...” What is wrong
with colored clothes? Just the past life, that Spanish bull life, a
hangover...</p><p><br></p><p>“And he gives them to wear a necklace of beads or mala.” What is
wrong in it? It is just to irritate people like you, J. Krishnamurti,
people who have a tunnel vision. so I put my people exactly at the other
end of the tunnel, so whatsoever you can see are only orange people with
a mala and my picture.</p><p><br></p><p>And the moment he will see my picture, he is no more in his senses.
That is the moment when he transcends his mind. That is an opportunity
for him to go into meditation, otherwise he is a very rational man, very
much tethered to the mind. Whatsoever he goes on saying is just
mind-stuff. He has transcended the mind, but the way he expresses he
uses his mind only.</p><p><br></p><p>I am using many other devices too. I use the mind, I use the words, I
use the silence, I use the music – yes, I can even use the Hollywood
music and make you enlightened through it. That’s how the alchemist
functions. This very life has to he used, and all that this life
contains.</p><p><br></p><p>I can send you to see a “blue movie” and tell you to just be a
witness, don’t get identified, and it becomes a meditation. And the blue
movie will be the right thing, because again and again you will forget
to be a witness. And again and again you will have to he a witness. It
will be a constant struggle. Just looking at a wall, anybody can become
a witness.</p><p><br></p><p>Bodhidharma was looking at a wall for nine years. There is no wonder
he became enlightened. What else can you do? He must have thought, “It
is better now to become enlightened – at least to get rid of this
wall.”</p><p><br></p><p>It is better to project a blue mt)vie on the wall and then be a
witness. And I tell you, you will not take nine years, far quicker – you
will be tired of all those naked women passing by.</p><p><br></p><p>Everything can be used. That’s why I am against renunciation –
everything in life can be used. Yes, even wine can be used. You can
drink it, but in small quantities in the beginning, and remain alert –
just a little quantity and then remain alert. Try to be alert when the
wine starts functioning in you. If you can be alert with wine, then go
on increasing the dose. One day you can drink the wine just like water
and still you are alert. And if you can drink the whole bottle and
remain alert, then nobody can make you unenlightened again.
Impossible!</p><p><br></p><p>This has been used; this is not a new method. This has been used for
centuries in India, from the days of the RIG VEDA; they called it
soma-ras, it is the same. everything can be used. In fact, the more you
have been taught to be against alcohol, against other drugs, the more
you have become interested in them. And nobody teaches you how to use
these drugs – alcohol, other intoxicants – to become alert, aware.</p><p>In a better world, in a more scientific world, every commune should
have a small place with experts to give you small doses of intoxicant
and help you to remain alert. And if you can remain alert while every
possibility is of losing alertness, then in ordinary life you will be
alert without any difficulty.</p><p><br></p><p>So, Chris, just avoid J. Krishnamurti, and that too only till you
have become a sannyasin. Yet you are not a sannyasin; once you are a
sannyasin there is no need to avoid anybody. Go to Krishnamurti, go
anywhere. Let them avoid you!</p><p><br></p><p>This will be a great thing...</p><p><br></p><p>He never comes to Poona; he used to come in the past. This is the
time, now he soul come – now the spring has come to Poona. He used to
visit town when it was dead. Now he should come and I will send five
thousand sannyasins and you will see that even an enlightened person
dances. Of course. it will not be a very beautiful dance, but he will
jump and scream, and hit his head. It will be some sort of dance, a
little weird, something like jogging dynamic meditation. And when he is
doing that, put a mala around his neck!</p><p><br></p><p>The last question:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 4 OSHO,</p><p>WHY ARE THE INDIANS SO INTOLERANT AND SO MUCH ANGRY AT YOU?
RADHE,</p><p>It is very simple. They are very religious people, the only religious
people in the world, very spiritual. This is the sign of their
spirituality, their religiousness – the so-called religious always
become fanatics. They talk about tolerance, but they are very
intolerant. In fact, the very idea of becoming tolerant has the seed of
intolerance in it.</p><p><br></p><p>When somebody says,“Be tolerant,” that simply means there is
intolerance. Why be tolerant? I am not tolerant, hence I need not be
intolerant either. Why should I be tolerant or intolerant? They are two
sides of the same coin. Rut these so-called religious people, these
phony spiritualists, are bound to be intolerant because they are
repressing their anger, their rage. They are boiling within.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the other day I was seeing the newspapers. One article suggests
– a very religious person who has written the article – that Bhagwan
Shree Rajneesh should be given electroshocks. This is Indian culture,
religiousness, nonviolence, celibacy, great heritage, the country of the
great seers – asking the government to give me electroshocks.</p><p><br></p><p>The second article I saw yesterday was that I should be deported
immediately. The third article was that the Indian government should
throw me into the Arabian Ocean – not even in the Indian Ocean, because
I may pollute the Indian Ocean. “Throw him in the Arabian Ocean, so if
he pollutes, he pollutes the Arabs!”</p><p>My suggestion is: all these three things can be done together; there
is no need to do separately. First, give me electroshocks, then deport
me and don’t give me any passport, so of course I cannot go outside the
country; and because you have deported me, then throw me into the
Arabian Ocean. And this will save your country, your religion, your
culture, your great heritage! This will prove to the world that you are
really the gurus of the world, that the whole world needs your advice
and your wisdom.</p><p><br></p><p>Radhe, they are angry because I am not supporting their beliefs. They
are against me because I am original, and they are always against
anything that is original, because the original means anti-traditional,
anti-conventional. And India has lived with borrowed knowledge for
centuries.</p><p><br></p><p>Chandulal: “Good evening, thought I would drop in and see you about
the umbrella you borrowed from me last week.”</p><p><br></p><p>Gaurilal: “I’m sorry, but I lent it to a friend of mine. Did you want
it?”</p><p><br></p><p>Chandulal: “Well, not for myself, but the fellow I borrowed it from
says the owner wants it.”</p><p><br></p><p>This is the way of the Indian mind – borrowing, borrowing. And the
moment they see something new, they become afraid. It is their fear that
becomes anger. Remember always, it is fear standing upside down that
becomes anger – fear doing a headstand, sirshasan, becomes anger. Anger
is just a security, because deep down they are feeling afraid.</p><p><br></p><p>Not a single argument is said against me. Now, do you think these are
arguments against me? – electroshocks, deportation, throwing into the
Arabian Sea... these are arguments? Not a single argument is there. They
are feeling very impotent, and out of their impotency great rage is
arising.</p><p><br></p><p>And they go on again and again asking me for many things. Pundit
Lajjashankara Jha has asked two things:</p><p>Question 5</p><p><br></p><p>WHY ARE NOT THE INDIANS ALLOWED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE THERAPY
GROUPS?</p><p><br></p><p>Second: ARE YOU BRAINWASHING THE INNOCENT WESTERNERS IN THE THERAPY
GROUPS?</p><p><br></p><p>First he wants to know why Indians are not allowed in the therapy
groups. Will they understand therapy? Will they understand bringing all
their repressed sexuality out? Will they be able to realize and
recognize their ugliness? Will they be able to see in the mirror of
therapy their original face?</p><p><br></p><p>I am perfectly ready to allow them. Pundit Lajjashankara Jha can be
allowed, but will he be ready to put his scholarship – he is a pundit, a
brahmin – will he be able to put his past aside and go into a therapy
group? Will he be ready to be really spiritually naked, truthful,
honest? – because a therapy group can function only if you are
authentic, if you say only that which you feel. But something else will
happen: he will not say what he feels, he will say what is expected of
him to say.</p><p>Just the other day one sannyasin informed me that an Indian fell to
her feet and started massaging her feet and telling her, “Mother,
mother,” and then started taking his hand upwards. She stopped him but
he will not listen, calling, “Mother!” and “Mother!” And he was trying
to reach to her thighs, and “Mother” – this dual personality, saying
“Mother” and trying to touch her naked body...</p><p><br></p><p>Indians are not allowed for the simple reason that they cannot open
themselves. They have become the most closed people in the world. Even
if they cannot understand what I am saying here, how they can go into a
really deep therapeutic situation? It will be impossible for them.</p><p><br></p><p>And the second question shows his fear already:</p><p><br></p><p>Question 6</p><p><br></p><p>ARE YOU BRAINWASHING THE WESTERN PEOPLE, THE INNOCENT PEOPLE IN THE
THERAPY GROUPS?</p><p><br></p><p>His fear is there, that if he allows himself and opens up he will be
brainwashed. Don’t be afraid, Pundit Lajjashankara Jha, because to be
brain-washed one thing is absolutely needed – that is brain! How can I
brainwash you? First you will have to have brain in there, then it can
be washed. We will wash it clean, but first it has to be there.</p><p><br></p><p>And he calls them, “innocent western people.” If they are innocent
then there is no need to wash them. In fact, you need washing, but you
don’t have the brain. They have the brain, but they don’t need washing.
You see my troubles?</p><p><br></p><p>The Indians are angry with me because they hoped, expected that I
will give more nourishment to their ego, and rather than giving
nourishment to their ego I started shattering it to pieces. That’s what
is hurting them – I am not fulfilling their expectations.</p><p><br></p><p>They will not say it clearly, but every day I see in newspapers.
People write about me that, “When you were giving discourses on Srimad
Bhagavad Gita, it was so beautiful! We had enjoyed it so much. When you
were taking on Mahavira we had loved it. But now whatsoever you are
doing, we hate it!”</p><p><br></p><p>Why they loved when I was talking on Bhagavad Gita? Because they felt
that I am bringing the message of Krishna up to date, I am making it
contemporary.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t be worried. Once the commune is settled I will again talk on
Bhagavad Gita – and you will hate it, because then I will tell you the
real truth. The last time I was just talking about the circumference of
the Bhagavad Gita; now I will expose its reality, its nakedness, and
then you will hate me more.</p><p><br></p><p>But you are asking it...</p><p>Durga has her first date and comes home at two o’clock at night.
“Where have you been?” the worried mother wants to know. “Oh, I went to
a party with Prem,” she answers.</p><p>“And then where did you go?” she wants to know. “We went to his
room,” she says.</p><p>“And what did you do there?” worried mum wants to know. “We had a
drink, sat on the bed and talked.”</p><p>“Darling, what then?” mum says, jumping up and down. “Then he asked
me to close my eyes, and he undressed me.” “Darling, and then?” mum is
nearly fainting.</p><p>“Then he gave me a leotard and a pair of roller skates... and mum,
why are you laughing?”</p><p><br></p><p>Try to get it! Let me repeat: “Then he gave me a leotard and a pair
of rolling skates... and mum, why are you laughing?”</p><p><br></p><p>The mother is waiting..some hidden expectation that now this is going
to happen, now this is going to happen, now this is the last moment and
it is going to happen... And suddenly it does not happen.</p><p><br></p><p>The Indians have been waiting for me, that I will go around the world
spreading Indian religion and the message of the Vedas. Why should I do
all that nonsense? When I can give my own message, why should I give
anybody else’s message? The seers of the Vedas were not concerned with
me, why I should be concerned with them? They never gave my message, why
should I give their message?</p><p><br></p><p>But they have a very rotten language of understanding. They can
understand only that which is written in their scriptures. They cannot
understand anything else. Howsoever rotten it is... and much of it is
bound to be rotten; the world has grown, man has come of age.</p><p><br></p><p>A man went into a butcher’s shop and asked for half a pound of
kidley. “I beg your pardon,” said the butcher.</p><p>“I want half a pound of kidley.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Say that again?” “Half a pound of kidley.”</p><p><br></p><p>“Are you sure you don’t mean half a pound of kidney?” “That’s what I
said, diddle l?”</p><p>It is a question of language.</p><p><br></p><p>Once a sannyasin asked an Indian in a chai shop for information. He
said, “Excuse me, where can I buy some shampoo?”</p><p>The chaiwalla said, “You are from which country?” “Australia,” said
the sannyasin.</p><p>“America?” queried the Indian. “Not America – Australia!”</p><p>“England? Germany? Oh, yes... Germany people very good. You are
married or single?” “Not married,” said the swami. “But where can I buy
some shampoo?”</p><p>“What you want?” “Shampoo!”</p><p>“For what you want this?”</p><p><br></p><p>“To wash my balls!” snapped the sannyasin. “What do you think?” “Oh,
oh yes,” he said, “you are a tourist or you are coming for study?” “l
want to buy some shampoo!! Do you know where I can buy some?” “What?
What you want?”</p><p>“Shampoo!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh yes, you can buy.” “But where can I buy it?” “In shop you can
buy!” “Yes, but which shop?” “What you want?”</p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part13>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a></p><p>  </p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://osho.lol/posts/from_darkness_to_light/part14/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>14 The best government is no government</span>

BUT WHEN I AM WITH THEM, LOTS OF CONFLICTS ARISE AND I FEEL LIKE RUNNING AWAY FROM FAMILY, JOB, TRADITION, ET CETERA. BUT WHEN I’M AWAY I FEEL THAT’S NOT IT – THAT’S NOT THE ANSWER.\nWHAT IS GOING ON? CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT TO DO? DEVA SARITO,\nIT IS NOT A QUESTION OF DOING. Whatsoever you do will be wrong, because you are not in a right space. YOU are not right, how can you do anything right? That is impossible.\nIt is a question of being, not of doing. Hence, you can move from one prison into another, but you cannot be free. You can escape from the world, you will still be miserable – for new reasons of course. You can change your wife, you can change your job, you can change your house, you can change your religion, your church; still you will be the same. All these changes are superficial. They are just like painting your face black, white, red... but deep down nothing is changed, you remain the same.\nYou have to become more aware. And awareness is not a question of doing, it is a question of being. It is something about your essential core, nothing about your circumference. That’s why it is happening to you... not only to you, it is happening to everybody.\nI have known people who have renounced life, renounced the wife, the children, the marketplace, have moved to the Himalayas, to the caves. Still, sitting in their caves they are miserable – the same misery. There are no more the same old causes. But those causes were just excuses, they were not real causes. The real cause is always within you, and how you can escape from it? Wherever you go, you will be yourself. Sitting in the Himalayan caves, they are still themselves, utterly miserable. And now they are thinking, “What we are doing here?” Now they have forgotten all the misery of the world, now they remember with nostalgia all the joys of the world. They may not have experienced those joys; they may be just imagining, fantasizing.\nMiserable people have the habit – it is something inevitable, otherwise it will become impossible to live – to fantasize beautiful things, either about the past or about the future. The present is always miserable wherever you are, it is misery that surrounds you. To escape from that misery, at least to forget all about it, the best opium is to think with nostalgia about the past – the wife that you have left behind, the children, the beautiful home, the coziness, the security, the safety – all those sweet things which may not have happened at all; you may have just created them, invented them. Or, if you don’t have much past and you cannot paint anything on the past, then the future is there – a vast canvas. You can always think of a beautiful tomorrow. If the yesterday is not worth painting, then you can always paint the tomorrow. It is always there.\nAnd this is the way man has been avoiding the present. But to avoid the present is to avoid the real cause of it all.\nThe new inmate at the mental hospital announced in a loud voice that he was the famous British naval hero, Lord Nelson. This was particularly interesting because the institution already had a Lord Nelson.\nThe head psychiatrist, after due consideration, decided to put the two men in the same room, feeling that the similarity of their delusions might prompt an adjustment in each that would help in curing them. It was a calculated risk, of course, for the men might react violently to one another; but they were introduced and then left alone, and no disturbance was heard from the room that night.\nThe next morning the doctor had a talk with his new patient, and was more than pleasantly surprised when he was told, “Doctor, I have been suffering from delusion. I know now that I am not Lord Nelson.”\n“That’s wonderful,” said the doctor.\n“Yes,” said the patient smiling demurely, “I am Lady Hamilton.”\nOne can change from being Lord Nelson – one can become Lady Hamilton – but there is no change at all. That’s what people are doing all over the world. They change their religion, they change their wives, their husbands; they change their jobs, they change their outer situations. And again and again they are surprised – nothing is changing. The misery persists, it remains the same. In\nfact, the more they change outer circumstances, the more they become aware of one thing: that the misery is not going to leave, that it is going to be there. Their frustration becomes more settled, their failure becomes their very lifestyle.\nYou ask me: OSHO, CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT TO DO?\nYou have done enough. Now, be done with it all. No more doing. Move from doing to being, become a little more aware. Wherever you are – in the family, with the family, or somewhere else – wherever you are, become more aware. Try to be now and here... this moment, this silence.\nDon’t move from thisness. It will be difficult in the beginning; every small distraction will take you away. Just a bird starts calling and you are distracted. You cannot accept it; immediately you find an excuse. You start thinking what bird it is, and then the whole chain – the sound of the railway train, the traffic noise, anything is enough to take you away from the now. And that is the root cause of misery: to be there and then. And there is the only source of bliss, the only source, I say: to be now and here.\nOnce you have learned to be present to the present then there is no problem at all. Then your response is total, then your response is from your very innermost core, very fulfilling. Then even living in the family situation with all the conflicts of it, you will remain untouched.\nThe conflicts will be everywhere. If you go to a monastery, there will be conflicts there – the same struggle, the same competition, the hierarchy: somebody trying to boss, somebody trying to put you the way he wants to put you together. Everywhere you will find manipulation, domination, nagging. Everywhere you will find exploitation of your fear, of your greed. Hence, changing situations is not going to help, it has never helped anybody – but it has been one of the ways of wasting one’s life.\nFor centuries people created monasteries, people created such monasteries that you enter once inside the monastery and you cannot leave it again. It is for your whole life. People became so much afraid of each other – of the wife, of the husband – that there are Catholic monasteries where no woman has ever entered for one thousand years. What fear! The founders of those monasteries must have been really terribly tortured by their wives. Now even an innocent woman, who is not your wife, is not allowed to enter inside the monastery. Not only a woman, but even a small girl, a six-month-old girl, is not allowed.\nWhat kind of fear? Are these monks afraid of a six-month-old girl? Are they afraid of the girl, or are they afraid of themselves? Are they going to rape the small child, or what? Are they monks or monsters? But the fear has dominated them. And there are nuns and their nunneries where no man is allowed to enter. But these people are living in misery.\nHere are many ex-monks, ex-nuns, Christian, Hindu, Jaina. They have suffered very much, they have to escape from those prisons. But people coming here also expect some kind of monastery.\nJust the other day I was reading an article in an Australian magazine against me. The woman who had come to cover the ashram and its activities is very much shocked. She seems to be a very traditional, orthodox woman, interested in yoga and Hindu spirituality et cetera. She says, “This is a strange kind of ashram. Nobody has ever heard of anything like this.”\nShe is offended by one thing most: that people are laughing, dancing, singing – that people are alive, in short. She is very much offended that a certain climate of a “holiday resort” is there. She must have looked for a prison, not a holiday resort. What is wrong in the “climate of a holiday resort”? That should be the climate of the whole earth! That should be the very climate of life itself. Life should be a holiday. Only a holiday is a holy day.\nAnd people are working here, people are continuously working. It is not that they are just lazying around – but the climate is certainly of joy, of laughter. That offends.\nThe whole article is obsessed with the idea that an ashram has to be ascetic, people have to be there doing yoga postures, standing on their head, doing all kinds of gymnastics, chanting mantras, doing religious rituals, and very serious – as if they are just walking corpses. Then she would have been immensely pleased. This is a “religious” place, she would have called, a “spiritual” place.\nReading her article I decided one thing: that the new commune will not be called ashram – that word certainly is ugly. We will drop it. This is not an ashram... In a way, this is the ONLY ashram, because literally “ashram” means rest, restfulness. But it has become associated with wrong people. We will drop it.\nPeople come with all kinds of ideas. They are miserable in their ideas, but still they are looking for the same ideas. And if they don’t find them they don’t feel good. They are miserable and they want everybody else also to be miserable.\nJust one gentleman has written to me that, “Osho, your claim that Swami Vimalkirti attained Buddhahood sounds phony...” As if this gentleman knows what Buddhahood is.\nI was very pleased with his question. I thought, “My God, Gautam Buddha is here! Who knows what Buddhahood is and what Buddhahood is not, who knows the distinction between the authentic Buddhahood and the phony Buddhahood.” Must be a man far superior than all the Buddhas; only then you can judge.\nBut he must have come with a certain idea. In fact, Hindus were offended by Gautam Buddha’s declaration himself, that he has become enlightened, because they had their own idea – just like this gentleman – they had their own idea. In fact, this gentleman will be surprised that Buddha’s own five disciples immediately left him, thinking that he has gone either mad or is pretending to be enlightened. His own five disciples, who had been worshipping him up to now... while he was not a Buddha they were worshipping him as their Master. And the moment he declared that he is a Buddha – it must have sounded phony – they left him immediately. And what was their argument? Their argument was that he has fallen into the trap of the ego, he has fallen from his ascetic life.\nBecause for six years Buddha tortured himself as much as any human being has ever tortured, and found nothing by that torture... it was sheer masochistic teachings of the ages that he has been following. But he was an intelligent man, he understood. One full-moon evening, as the moon was rising, he could see the whole stupidity of what he has been doing for six years. Just by torturing your body, how you can become enlightened? What relationship exists between torturing your body, destroying your body, and Buddhahood?\nThat evening he dropped torturing. He told his disciples that now he will live relaxedly, now he will not torture himself, now he will follow the middle path. Up to now he has been doing something extremist. First he lived the life of a prince, indulged in all kinds of pleasures and luxuries – that was one extreme. Then he moved to another extreme: he renounced the world and all its comforts, luxuries, pleasures, and started torturing himself, started a suicidal course – that was another extreme. He said to his disciples, “But tonight I have come to a tremendous understanding, that truth is not to be found by extremes. I have renounced the world, today I renounce that renunciation too! Now I will be just ordinary, neither a king nor an ascetic.”\nThe disciples immediately left him, and that very night he become enlightened. He searched his disciples because he felt they have been with him for so long – for six years continuously – it is his duty that he should share his understanding, his bliss, his love, first with those five disciples. When he reached close to those five disciples they were sitting under a tree. They looked at Buddha coming and they said, “Here comes that fallen man! We should not stand up to pay respect to him, we should not fold our hands in respect to him. We should keep our backs towards him. If he comes and he sits, it’s okay; if he wants to say something, it’s okay, but we are not going to pay him any more respect or attention.”\nEven Gautam Buddha is not understood by his own disciples.\nThis gentleman says my assertion that Vimalkirti has attained Buddhahood sounds phony. Why? What is wrong with Vimalkirti attaining Buddhahood? If I can attain it, why Vimalkirti cannot attain it? Why you cannot attain it?\nBuddhahood is not something like a goal far away; it is your very nature. In fact, you are all Buddhas, although unaware of the fact. All that happens in attaining Buddhahood is one becomes aware of it! The treasure is there – it is ALWAYS there, you cannot lose it even if you want to lose it! It is your very being, hence there is no way to drop it. Who will drop it? But you can forget about it. And Buddhahood simply means a remembering, a recognition. Why it sounds phony? – unless you have some preconceived ideas. If you have some idea how a Buddha should be, then certainly...\nJainas in India have not accepted Buddha yet as enlightened. Twenty-five centuries have passed and I don’t think they will ever accept him as a Buddha, for the simple reason because they have a certain attitude which is not fulfilled by him. They think whenever a person becomes a Buddha he goes naked, and Buddha never went naked. That’s enough to prove that he was not a Buddha. When a person becomes a Buddha he drops even a begging bowl, he possesses nothing. And Buddha possessed three clothes, one begging bowl, one walking staff – too many possessions! This won’t do. He’s still living in luxury. According to Jainas, still it is luxury.\nMahavira lived naked, with no begging bowl, with nothing at all. He used to eat from his hands, he used to drink water from his hands. He will lie down on the earth to sleep, earth underneath and the sky above. Hence he was called DIGAMBARA. The word DIGAMBARA means one who is clothed with the sky only, and nothing else. The sky itself is his clothing – nothing else between him and the sky.\nHow can they accept Buddha, that he has become enlightened?\nHindus cannot accept him. Christians cannot accept him – that he was a man of the same caliber as Christ, because he never did any miracles. A Christ is supposed to do miracles, to cure blind people, to make the ill healthy, to raise the dead back to life. How can they accept Buddha as a Christ? – he never raised any dead. In fact, a story is worth remembering:\nWhen Lazarus’ sisters asked Christ to come and raise Lazarus from death, he came running. He was far away, it took him four days to reach there. And after four days he raised Lazarus from his grave. He called forth Lazarus, “Lazarus come out of your grave!” and Lazarus walked out.\nA similar story is told about Buddha, but with a totally different dimension to it. A woman’s only son died; her husband has died before. Her name was Kissagautami. She went almost mad: husband is dead, she was living only for this child... and a beautiful child, suddenly died! She carried the body of the son to every physician, every doctor, to every saint, and they all said, “Nothing can be done about it.” Somebody suggested, “Buddha is in the town. Why don’t you go to him? He says he has become enlightened. If he is really enlightened, he can raise the dead. His touch will do the miracle.” And Kissagautami was ecstatic, knowing that Buddha is here – “And what is impossible to a Buddha?”\nShe went to Buddha with the dead body of the child. She put the child’s body in Buddha’s feet and told him, “You can do everything – you are enlightened! Make my child live again. I cannot live without my child.”\nBuddha did not do what Christ had done, Buddha did something far more significant. But to understand its significance one needs great clarity.\nThis gentleman who says that my assertion that Vimalkirti has attained Buddhahood... If he was there – and there is every possibility he must have been there if he is here. He must be an ancient traveler, shopping for some spirituality. He must have gone to Buddha, he must have been there, and he must have thought that, “This man sounds phony.” What Buddha said sounds phony, if you compare it with Jesus, and if you don’t have deep understanding of life and its mysteries.\nBuddha said, “Okay, I will revive the child back, but you will have to fulfill one condition: You go into the town and you bring few mustard seeds from any family. The only condition is that I will accept the mustard seeds only from a family in which nobody has ever died. Once you have brought those few mustard seeds I will immediately revive your son back.”\nThe woman could not see the point; she was in such a state, almost going mad. She rushed in the town, she knocked on every door. And the people said that, “We can give you as many mustard seeds as you want” – because that town used to grow mustard seeds, that was their main crop. So they said, “We can give you as many mustard seeds as you want, but the condition is unfulfillable. So many people have died in our family – somebody’s father has died, somebody’s mother, somebody’s wife, somebody’s husband, somebody’s grandfather, somebody’s great-grandfather – so many people have died.”\nIn fact, in a family only few people are alive, millions have died. If you take the whole account of the family, from Adam and Eve, then millions of your family have died. It is a miracle how so very few are still alive. You are sitting on a huge mountain of corpses: your fathers, grandfathers,\ngreat-grandfathers, great-great-great-grandfathers. And underneath it all the poor Adam, Eve... And Friedrich Nietzsche says even God is dead. So underneath Adam and Eve, God the father – that seems to be the foundation of this whole Everest of death. And you are sitting on top of it, and not aware at all, that soon you will be really part of it. It is only a question of few moments; any moment you will be part of it. And somebody else will be sitting on top of you: your son, your daughter, your son-in-law... somebody will be sitting on top of you.\nThe woman by and by became aware that the condition is unfulfillable. By the evening she came – she came dancing, she came rejoicing. She fell in Buddha’s feet and she said, “You have done a great miracle! You have made me see something, you have helped me to remember that this life is death.”\nBuddha asked her, “Do you want me to revive your child again?”\nThe woman said. “No, because he will have to die again. What is the point? Making him die again is ugly. Once is enough, twice will be too much. Rather, I have come for something else now: You help me to know that life which never ends. The son is gone, I will be gone. Before I am gone, I would like to taste something of the eternal.”\nBuddha initiated her into sannyas.\nNow these two stories, Lazarus’ and Kissagautami’s, are in a way parallel. Christ makes Lazarus alive, Buddha gives Kissagautami a new insight into life and death itself. To a Christian, Buddha will look phony. To a Buddhist, Jesus will look phony. What he is doing? This is sheer nonsense! Because what happened to Lazarus then? Some day he must have died – because we don’t see him around any more. If he was going to die, what is the point of postponing it for few days, or few years? Why let him go through that suffering again? – the same wife, the same children, and the same job...\nLazarus, I don’t think will be able to forgive Jesus. He was resting in his grave, feeling, “Thank God, all that nightmare is finished. Now my wife cannot nag me any more, I am out of their reach. I don’t have to go tomorrow morning again to the office.” But Jesus pulled him back. And the Christian fools think this is a miracle!\nIf I had been in Lazarus’ place, I would have killed Jesus: “What are you doing? Don’t you have any respect for anybody? Dragging somebody back into the turmoil of life? Is it human?”\nThis gentleman says that my claim is phony. He also says that my criticism of Mother Teresa seems to be criticism of a very ordinary man. That is true. There I agree: I am certainly a very ordinary man – so ordinary that you cannot even call me phony, because a phony person is not ordinary, he’s extraordinary. I am REALLY ordinary. I have no claims. I don’t do any miracles... And of course, he must have come with the idea that Mother Teresa is doing great work. She is extraordinary, I am ordinary; that’s perfectly true.\nAnd I am not in any way interested in becoming extraordinary. To me, any desire to be extraordinary is very ordinary. To be ordinary is the only way of being extraordinary, because that is REALLY extraordinary. Nobody wants to be ordinary.\nBut this gentleman must be as unconscious as, Deva Sarito, you are.\nTwo buddies had been out drinking for hours when their money finally ran out.\n“I have an idea,” croaked Al. “Lesh go over to my housh and borrow shum money from my wife.”\nThe two of them reeled into Al’s living room, snapped on the light, and lo and behold, there was Al’s wife making love on the sofa to another man. This state of affairs considerably unnerved Al’s friend, but did not seem to affect the husband.\n“Shay, dear, you have any money for your ever-lovin’ hushban’?” he asked.\n“Yes, yes,” she snapped. “Take my purse from the mantle, and for Pete’s sake turn off those lights!”\nOutside they examined the purse and Al proudly announced, “There’s enough here for a pint for you and a pint for me. Pretty good, eh, old buddy?”\n“But Al,” protested his friend, somewhat sobered by the spectacle he had just witnessed, “what about that fellow back there with your wife?”\n“The hell with him,” replied Al, “let him buy his own pint!”\nDeva Sarito, All that is needed is a little more consciousness. It is not a question of doing something; you need a new kind of being. Right now you are unconscious; you have to be conscious. You have to be more aware, watchful, witnessing.\nWitnessing is the key of my sannyas, the master key. I don’t give you any other discipline, because giving you any discipline will not help. Your unconsciousness will be there, and the discipline will only cover it. You can look like a saint but you will be as unconscious as before. Your saintliness will be as unconscious as your sinfulness was; there will be no qualitative difference in it.\nSo I am not interested in making saints out of you. I am not interested in helping you to drop your sins either. What I am interested is to make you aware, and the moment you start becoming aware of your actions, your thoughts, your feelings... these are the three dimensions awareness has to be applied. Walk, but know that you are walking. Remain alert of each gesture. Eat but eat with awareness; don’t just go on stuffing food inside. Think, but witness your thoughts, the process of thoughts, desires, dreams. Feel, but remain a little aware that these feelings, these moods are not you.\nYou are only pure awareness and nothing else. You are not the body, nor the mind, nor the heart. You are the fourth, and the fourth is the miracle. Once you have tasted the fourth, then wherever you are – even in hell – but you will be in heaven.\nThe second question: Question 2\nOSHO,\nI AM A MEMBER OF A GROUP IN HOLLAND CALLED “THE OPEN LOTUS”, WHICH IS GATHERED AROUND A MEDIUM WHO CLAIMS TO TRANSFER MESSAGES AND ENERGIES FROM MASTER MORYA.\nTHIS HAS VERY MUCH AFFECTED MY HEART AND BEING WHEN I AM IN YOUR AUDIENCE I FEEL A KIND OF MELTING, BUT MY HEART DOES NOT AS YET SEEM TO BE SO DEEPLY TOUCHED AS IT IS WITH THE MEDIUM. WHAT IS HAPPENING?\nIS THE EXPERIENCE WITH THE UNSEEN MASTER MORYA UNREAL AND SOMETHING OF THE MIND? CAN IT BE A HINDRANCE TO BECOMING ONE WITH YOU, OSHO? ARE YOU IN SUPPORT OF GROUPS LIKE THE OPEN LOTUS? IF SO, DO YOU HAVE A MESSAGE FOR THEM?\nMARINUS,\nFirst, meditate over this story:\nStan and his wife, Rita, were playing the tenth hole. He teed off and Rita hit hers into the woods.\nStan had not hit his ball very far on the fairway, so he went into the woods to help her find it. Suddenly they came across a little fellow about four feet tall with a pointed hat and green suit.\n“Hey,” said Stan, “are you a leprechaun?” “Sure I am,” he replied.\n“Well, maybe you could grant my wish to be a scratch golfer.”\n“All right, but you have to give up something. If you let me have your wife in the woods for one hour, I will grant your wish.”\n“You’ve got it!” said the husband.\nThe little guy took Rita into the woods and after an hour’s pleasure asked, “How old is your husband?”\n“Forty.”\n“And he still believes in leprechauns?”\nMarinus, how old you are? – and you still believe in Master Morya? You must be feeling great, because if something happens according to your belief, it strengthens the ego, it nourishes the ego. And Master Morya is not visible, only the medium is there. And the medium is more concerned in impressing you, so she will follow you. In fact, there is no Master Morya anywhere. This whole idea of Master Morya was created by the Theosophists. It is an invention of Madame Blavatsky – Madame Blah-blah-blah. It is just fiction.\nMadame Blavatsky used to receive letters from Master Morya. In the roof there was a hole, and a servant used to hide above the roof, and all the Marinuses, the Theosophists, will sit with closed eyes waiting for Master Morya’s message. And Madame Blah-blah-blah will sway, and she was really a fat lady and very ugly too. Ugly people become religious – what else they can do? I have seen many ugly people, but Madame Blah-blah-blah defeats all. Only some fictitious entity like Master Morya may love her, no man – no man alive – will be able to gather so much courage.\nAnd she will sway, and she will speak gibberish – what Christians call glossolalia – strange sounds she will make. And much incense will be burned, and much smoke will be created so nobody could see what is happening. And their eyes will be full of tears because of the smoke... And then a letter will drop, and all these fools – and they were not uneducated people, all retired magistrates, high court judges, government officials, professors, scholars – they will wait for the letter. And the letter will be read then by Madame Blah-Blah-Blah.\nAnd great messages were received, but they were all fulfilling their desires. Whatsoever they wanted was fulfilled. They were immensely happy.\nIt was J. Krishnamurti who destroyed the whole game, who came out of this nonsense and declared that, “This is all stupidity.” J. Krishnamurti has done a great service to humanity by destroying the theosophical nonsense. But Holland used to be one of the great centers of theosophical movement, and still few fools go on living with the hangover.\nCertainly you will not feel the same here. In fact, you will feel just the opposite because I am continuously shattering your ego, I am hitting it hard. I am not here to nourish your ego, I am here to destroy it. You can be one with me only if you are totally egoless, otherwise there is no possibility.\nIf you want to enjoy your ego and your dreams and your fantasies, then these mediums are good. But remember, you will remain childish, you will never grow. Yes, sometimes coincidentally something may appear to be true. If a medium says thousands of things, one thing may coincide with reality. And the fools and the gullible immediately jump upon that one thing, and they make much fuss about it. And they think, “If one thing is right then others also must be right. Maybe we are not yet capable enough to understand, maybe we need more purity. We have to become as pure as the medium.”\nAnd what the medium says, you have to interpret it, and you always interpret according to your mind. And these Masters don’t exist at all.\n“I have learned one thing about women,” said the experienced one to his drinking companions. “You just can’t trust a girl with brown eyes.”\n“It occurs to me,” said one of his inebriated friends, “that I have been married nearly three years and I don’t know what color eyes my wife has.”\nThe second man finished his drink, climbed from his stool, and hurried home to investigate this disturbing possibility.\nHis wife was in bed asleep. He crept up to her and carefully lifted an eyelid. “By God! Brown!” he exclaimed.\n“How the hell did you know I was here?” said Brown, crawling out from under the bed.\nYes, once in a while some coincidence like that will happen. Beware! And all these mediums and all these priests and all these theosophists, theologians – and they have many brands all around the world – they are the most cunning people. It is better to be with a gambler, with a drunkard, it is better to be with a so-called sinner, than to be with these people. These people have been preventing human growth for thousands of years. They are the most criminal people in the world. Their crime is unpardonable.\nA genie jumped on his ball and said, “Would you like to be the world’s best golfer?” “I sure would,” said the man.\n“Would you give up your sex life for it?” “Of course,” said the man.\nThe genie granted his wish, and in the next twelve months he won every tournament on the pro tour. After the year was up, the man was back on the eighteenth tee, and once again the genie appeared. “How did it feel to be the world’s best golfer?”\n“Great!” said the man.\n“Did you mind giving up your sex life?” “Not at all.”\n“How often did you have sex in former years?” “Four or five times a year,” replied the man.\n“That’s not very much!”\n“Well, it is not bad for a priest with a small parish.”\nThese priests, these rabbis, these AYATOLLAHS, these IMAMS – beware of them. It is time that humanity should get rid of all this stupidity.\nRabbi Goldstein was allowed to join a “restricted” country club. His first day he met Peckham, the president.\n“Welcome, Rabbi Goldstein. Would you like to play a round?” “Sure, we will play a friendly game of hundred dollars a hole.” Rabbi Goldstein lost eighteen hundred dollars.\n“Look ’ said Peckham,”I will give you a chance to get even. Three thousand six hundred dollars or nothing.”\nRabbi Goldstein agreed and lost again.\nLater in the locker room, Rabbi Goldstein said, “You like to wager. I will bet you one thousand dollars I can pee over your head from ten feet.”\n“All right,” said the club prexy. “But nobody can pee that far.” Rabbi Goldstein proceeded to pee all over Peckham.\n“See,” he said, after changing his clothes. “I knew you could not do it. Come on, I will buy.”\nAt the bar they met Lockwood, the local bank chairman. “This is Rabbi Goldstein,” said the club president. “He is one of our new members.”\nPeckham then told Lockwood about the money he had won, including how Rabbi Goldstein had peed all over him.\n“Oh no!” cried the banker, “That s.o.b. bet me twenty thousand dollars he would piss all over the president on his first day at the club!”\n\u003c Previous | Contents | Next \u003e\n","wordCount":"5687","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Osho"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://osho.lol/posts/the_wild_geese_and_the_water/part6/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Osho - The complete works of Osho","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://osho.lol/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://osho.lol/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://osho.lol/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://osho.lol/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://osho.lol/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://example.org title=example.org><span>example.org</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://osho.lol/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/>Posts</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://osho.lol/posts/the_wild_geese_and_the_water/>The Wild Geese and the Water</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">6 Still Believing in Leprechauns?</h1><div class=post-meta>27 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;5687 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Osho&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/The_Wild_Geese_and_the_Water/part6.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><a href=part5>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

LOVE FOR MY WIFE AND MY CHILDREN. BUT WHEN I AM WITH THEM, LOTS OF
CONFLICTS ARISE AND I FEEL LIKE RUNNING AWAY FROM FAMILY, JOB,
TRADITION, ET CETERA. BUT WHEN I’M AWAY I FEEL THAT’S NOT IT – THAT’S
NOT THE ANSWER.</p><p><br></p><p>WHAT IS GOING ON? CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT TO DO? DEVA SARITO,</p><p>IT IS NOT A QUESTION OF DOING. Whatsoever you do will be wrong,
because you are not in a right space. YOU are not right, how can you do
anything right? That is impossible.</p><p><br></p><p>It is a question of being, not of doing. Hence, you can move from one
prison into another, but you cannot be free. You can escape from the
world, you will still be miserable – for new reasons of course. You can
change your wife, you can change your job, you can change your house,
you can change your religion, your church; still you will be the same.
All these changes are superficial. They are just like painting your face
black, white, red... but deep down nothing is changed, you remain the
same.</p><p>You have to become more aware. And awareness is not a question of
doing, it is a question of being. It is something about your essential
core, nothing about your circumference. That’s why it is happening to
you... not only to you, it is happening to everybody.</p><p><br></p><p>I have known people who have renounced life, renounced the wife, the
children, the marketplace, have moved to the Himalayas, to the caves.
Still, sitting in their caves they are miserable – the same misery.
There are no more the same old causes. But those causes were just
excuses, they were not real causes. The real cause is always within you,
and how you can escape from it? Wherever you go, you will be yourself.
Sitting in the Himalayan caves, they are still themselves, utterly
miserable. And now they are thinking, “What we are doing here?” Now they
have forgotten all the misery of the world, now they remember with
nostalgia all the joys of the world. They may not have experienced those
joys; they may be just imagining, fantasizing.</p><p><br></p><p>Miserable people have the habit – it is something inevitable,
otherwise it will become impossible to live – to fantasize beautiful
things, either about the past or about the future. The present is always
miserable wherever you are, it is misery that surrounds you. To escape
from that misery, at least to forget all about it, the best opium is to
think with nostalgia about the past – the wife that you have left
behind, the children, the beautiful home, the coziness, the security,
the safety – all those sweet things which may not have happened at all;
you may have just created them, invented them. Or, if you don’t have
much past and you cannot paint anything on the past, then the future is
there – a vast canvas. You can always think of a beautiful tomorrow. If
the yesterday is not worth painting, then you can always paint the
tomorrow. It is always there.</p><p><br></p><p>And this is the way man has been avoiding the present. But to avoid
the present is to avoid the real cause of it all.</p><p><br></p><p>The new inmate at the mental hospital announced in a loud voice that
he was the famous British naval hero, Lord Nelson. This was particularly
interesting because the institution already had a Lord Nelson.</p><p><br></p><p>The head psychiatrist, after due consideration, decided to put the
two men in the same room, feeling that the similarity of their delusions
might prompt an adjustment in each that would help in curing them. It
was a calculated risk, of course, for the men might react violently to
one another; but they were introduced and then left alone, and no
disturbance was heard from the room that night.</p><p><br></p><p>The next morning the doctor had a talk with his new patient, and was
more than pleasantly surprised when he was told, “Doctor, I have been
suffering from delusion. I know now that I am not Lord Nelson.”</p><p><br></p><p>“That’s wonderful,” said the doctor.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes,” said the patient smiling demurely, “I am Lady Hamilton.”</p><p><br></p><p>One can change from being Lord Nelson – one can become Lady Hamilton
– but there is no change at all. That’s what people are doing all over
the world. They change their religion, they change their wives, their
husbands; they change their jobs, they change their outer situations.
And again and again they are surprised – nothing is changing. The misery
persists, it remains the same. In</p><p>fact, the more they change outer circumstances, the more they become
aware of one thing: that the misery is not going to leave, that it is
going to be there. Their frustration becomes more settled, their failure
becomes their very lifestyle.</p><p><br></p><p>You ask me: OSHO, CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT TO DO?</p><p><br></p><p>You have done enough. Now, be done with it all. No more doing. Move
from doing to being, become a little more aware. Wherever you are – in
the family, with the family, or somewhere else – wherever you are,
become more aware. Try to be now and here... this moment, this
silence.</p><p><br></p><p>Don’t move from thisness. It will be difficult in the beginning;
every small distraction will take you away. Just a bird starts calling
and you are distracted. You cannot accept it; immediately you find an
excuse. You start thinking what bird it is, and then the whole chain –
the sound of the railway train, the traffic noise, anything is enough to
take you away from the now. And that is the root cause of misery: to be
there and then. And there is the only source of bliss, the only source,
I say: to be now and here.</p><p><br></p><p>Once you have learned to be present to the present then there is no
problem at all. Then your response is total, then your response is from
your very innermost core, very fulfilling. Then even living in the
family situation with all the conflicts of it, you will remain
untouched.</p><p><br></p><p>The conflicts will be everywhere. If you go to a monastery, there
will be conflicts there – the same struggle, the same competition, the
hierarchy: somebody trying to boss, somebody trying to put you the way
he wants to put you together. Everywhere you will find manipulation,
domination, nagging. Everywhere you will find exploitation of your fear,
of your greed. Hence, changing situations is not going to help, it has
never helped anybody – but it has been one of the ways of wasting one’s
life.</p><p><br></p><p>For centuries people created monasteries, people created such
monasteries that you enter once inside the monastery and you cannot
leave it again. It is for your whole life. People became so much afraid
of each other – of the wife, of the husband – that there are Catholic
monasteries where no woman has ever entered for one thousand years. What
fear! The founders of those monasteries must have been really terribly
tortured by their wives. Now even an innocent woman, who is not your
wife, is not allowed to enter inside the monastery. Not only a woman,
but even a small girl, a six-month-old girl, is not allowed.</p><p><br></p><p>What kind of fear? Are these monks afraid of a six-month-old girl?
Are they afraid of the girl, or are they afraid of themselves? Are they
going to rape the small child, or what? Are they monks or monsters? But
the fear has dominated them. And there are nuns and their nunneries
where no man is allowed to enter. But these people are living in
misery.</p><p><br></p><p>Here are many ex-monks, ex-nuns, Christian, Hindu, Jaina. They have
suffered very much, they have to escape from those prisons. But people
coming here also expect some kind of monastery.</p><p><br></p><p>Just the other day I was reading an article in an Australian magazine
against me. The woman who had come to cover the ashram and its
activities is very much shocked. She seems to be a very traditional,
orthodox woman, interested in yoga and Hindu spirituality et cetera. She
says, “This is a strange kind of ashram. Nobody has ever heard of
anything like this.”</p><p>She is offended by one thing most: that people are laughing, dancing,
singing – that people are alive, in short. She is very much offended
that a certain climate of a “holiday resort” is there. She must have
looked for a prison, not a holiday resort. What is wrong in the “climate
of a holiday resort”? That should be the climate of the whole earth!
That should be the very climate of life itself. Life should be a
holiday. Only a holiday is a holy day.</p><p><br></p><p>And people are working here, people are continuously working. It is
not that they are just lazying around – but the climate is certainly of
joy, of laughter. That offends.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole article is obsessed with the idea that an ashram has to be
ascetic, people have to be there doing yoga postures, standing on their
head, doing all kinds of gymnastics, chanting mantras, doing religious
rituals, and very serious – as if they are just walking corpses. Then
she would have been immensely pleased. This is a “religious” place, she
would have called, a “spiritual” place.</p><p><br></p><p>Reading her article I decided one thing: that the new commune will
not be called ashram – that word certainly is ugly. We will drop it.
This is not an ashram... In a way, this is the ONLY ashram, because
literally “ashram” means rest, restfulness. But it has become associated
with wrong people. We will drop it.</p><p><br></p><p>People come with all kinds of ideas. They are miserable in their
ideas, but still they are looking for the same ideas. And if they don’t
find them they don’t feel good. They are miserable and they want
everybody else also to be miserable.</p><p><br></p><p>Just one gentleman has written to me that, “Osho, your claim that
Swami Vimalkirti attained Buddhahood sounds phony...” As if this
gentleman knows what Buddhahood is.</p><p><br></p><p>I was very pleased with his question. I thought, “My God, Gautam
Buddha is here! Who knows what Buddhahood is and what Buddhahood is not,
who knows the distinction between the authentic Buddhahood and the phony
Buddhahood.” Must be a man far superior than all the Buddhas; only then
you can judge.</p><p><br></p><p>But he must have come with a certain idea. In fact, Hindus were
offended by Gautam Buddha’s declaration himself, that he has become
enlightened, because they had their own idea – just like this gentleman
– they had their own idea. In fact, this gentleman will be surprised
that Buddha’s own five disciples immediately left him, thinking that he
has gone either mad or is pretending to be enlightened. His own five
disciples, who had been worshipping him up to now... while he was not a
Buddha they were worshipping him as their Master. And the moment he
declared that he is a Buddha – it must have sounded phony – they left
him immediately. And what was their argument? Their argument was that he
has fallen into the trap of the ego, he has fallen from his ascetic
life.</p><p><br></p><p>Because for six years Buddha tortured himself as much as any human
being has ever tortured, and found nothing by that torture... it was
sheer masochistic teachings of the ages that he has been following. But
he was an intelligent man, he understood. One full-moon evening, as the
moon was rising, he could see the whole stupidity of what he has been
doing for six years. Just by torturing your body, how you can become
enlightened? What relationship exists between torturing your body,
destroying your body, and Buddhahood?</p><p>That evening he dropped torturing. He told his disciples that now he
will live relaxedly, now he will not torture himself, now he will follow
the middle path. Up to now he has been doing something extremist. First
he lived the life of a prince, indulged in all kinds of pleasures and
luxuries – that was one extreme. Then he moved to another extreme: he
renounced the world and all its comforts, luxuries, pleasures, and
started torturing himself, started a suicidal course – that was another
extreme. He said to his disciples, “But tonight I have come to a
tremendous understanding, that truth is not to be found by extremes. I
have renounced the world, today I renounce that renunciation too! Now I
will be just ordinary, neither a king nor an ascetic.”</p><p><br></p><p>The disciples immediately left him, and that very night he become
enlightened. He searched his disciples because he felt they have been
with him for so long – for six years continuously – it is his duty that
he should share his understanding, his bliss, his love, first with those
five disciples. When he reached close to those five disciples they were
sitting under a tree. They looked at Buddha coming and they said, “Here
comes that fallen man! We should not stand up to pay respect to him, we
should not fold our hands in respect to him. We should keep our backs
towards him. If he comes and he sits, it’s okay; if he wants to say
something, it’s okay, but we are not going to pay him any more respect
or attention.”</p><p><br></p><p>Even Gautam Buddha is not understood by his own disciples.</p><p><br></p><p>This gentleman says my assertion that Vimalkirti has attained
Buddhahood sounds phony. Why? What is wrong with Vimalkirti attaining
Buddhahood? If I can attain it, why Vimalkirti cannot attain it? Why you
cannot attain it?</p><p><br></p><p>Buddhahood is not something like a goal far away; it is your very
nature. In fact, you are all Buddhas, although unaware of the fact. All
that happens in attaining Buddhahood is one becomes aware of it! The
treasure is there – it is ALWAYS there, you cannot lose it even if you
want to lose it! It is your very being, hence there is no way to drop
it. Who will drop it? But you can forget about it. And Buddhahood simply
means a remembering, a recognition. Why it sounds phony? – unless you
have some preconceived ideas. If you have some idea how a Buddha should
be, then certainly...</p><p><br></p><p>Jainas in India have not accepted Buddha yet as enlightened.
Twenty-five centuries have passed and I don’t think they will ever
accept him as a Buddha, for the simple reason because they have a
certain attitude which is not fulfilled by him. They think whenever a
person becomes a Buddha he goes naked, and Buddha never went naked.
That’s enough to prove that he was not a Buddha. When a person becomes a
Buddha he drops even a begging bowl, he possesses nothing. And Buddha
possessed three clothes, one begging bowl, one walking staff – too many
possessions! This won’t do. He’s still living in luxury. According to
Jainas, still it is luxury.</p><p><br></p><p>Mahavira lived naked, with no begging bowl, with nothing at all. He
used to eat from his hands, he used to drink water from his hands. He
will lie down on the earth to sleep, earth underneath and the sky above.
Hence he was called DIGAMBARA. The word DIGAMBARA means one who is
clothed with the sky only, and nothing else. The sky itself is his
clothing – nothing else between him and the sky.</p><p><br></p><p>How can they accept Buddha, that he has become enlightened?</p><p>Hindus cannot accept him. Christians cannot accept him – that he was
a man of the same caliber as Christ, because he never did any miracles.
A Christ is supposed to do miracles, to cure blind people, to make the
ill healthy, to raise the dead back to life. How can they accept Buddha
as a Christ? – he never raised any dead. In fact, a story is worth
remembering:</p><p><br></p><p>When Lazarus’ sisters asked Christ to come and raise Lazarus from
death, he came running. He was far away, it took him four days to reach
there. And after four days he raised Lazarus from his grave. He called
forth Lazarus, “Lazarus come out of your grave!” and Lazarus walked
out.</p><p><br></p><p>A similar story is told about Buddha, but with a totally different
dimension to it. A woman’s only son died; her husband has died before.
Her name was Kissagautami. She went almost mad: husband is dead, she was
living only for this child... and a beautiful child, suddenly died! She
carried the body of the son to every physician, every doctor, to every
saint, and they all said, “Nothing can be done about it.” Somebody
suggested, “Buddha is in the town. Why don’t you go to him? He says he
has become enlightened. If he is really enlightened, he can raise the
dead. His touch will do the miracle.” And Kissagautami was ecstatic,
knowing that Buddha is here – “And what is impossible to a Buddha?”</p><p><br></p><p>She went to Buddha with the dead body of the child. She put the
child’s body in Buddha’s feet and told him, “You can do everything – you
are enlightened! Make my child live again. I cannot live without my
child.”</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha did not do what Christ had done, Buddha did something far more
significant. But to understand its significance one needs great
clarity.</p><p><br></p><p>This gentleman who says that my assertion that Vimalkirti has
attained Buddhahood... If he was there – and there is every possibility
he must have been there if he is here. He must be an ancient traveler,
shopping for some spirituality. He must have gone to Buddha, he must
have been there, and he must have thought that, “This man sounds phony.”
What Buddha said sounds phony, if you compare it with Jesus, and if you
don’t have deep understanding of life and its mysteries.</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha said, “Okay, I will revive the child back, but you will have
to fulfill one condition: You go into the town and you bring few mustard
seeds from any family. The only condition is that I will accept the
mustard seeds only from a family in which nobody has ever died. Once you
have brought those few mustard seeds I will immediately revive your son
back.”</p><p><br></p><p>The woman could not see the point; she was in such a state, almost
going mad. She rushed in the town, she knocked on every door. And the
people said that, “We can give you as many mustard seeds as you want” –
because that town used to grow mustard seeds, that was their main crop.
So they said, “We can give you as many mustard seeds as you want, but
the condition is unfulfillable. So many people have died in our family –
somebody’s father has died, somebody’s mother, somebody’s wife,
somebody’s husband, somebody’s grandfather, somebody’s great-grandfather
– so many people have died.”</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, in a family only few people are alive, millions have died.
If you take the whole account of the family, from Adam and Eve, then
millions of your family have died. It is a miracle how so very few are
still alive. You are sitting on a huge mountain of corpses: your
fathers, grandfathers,</p><p>great-grandfathers, great-great-great-grandfathers. And underneath it
all the poor Adam, Eve... And Friedrich Nietzsche says even God is dead.
So underneath Adam and Eve, God the father – that seems to be the
foundation of this whole Everest of death. And you are sitting on top of
it, and not aware at all, that soon you will be really part of it. It is
only a question of few moments; any moment you will be part of it. And
somebody else will be sitting on top of you: your son, your daughter,
your son-in-law... somebody will be sitting on top of you.</p><p><br></p><p>The woman by and by became aware that the condition is unfulfillable.
By the evening she came – she came dancing, she came rejoicing. She fell
in Buddha’s feet and she said, “You have done a great miracle! You have
made me see something, you have helped me to remember that this life is
death.”</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha asked her, “Do you want me to revive your child again?”</p><p><br></p><p>The woman said. “No, because he will have to die again. What is the
point? Making him die again is ugly. Once is enough, twice will be too
much. Rather, I have come for something else now: You help me to know
that life which never ends. The son is gone, I will be gone. Before I am
gone, I would like to taste something of the eternal.”</p><p><br></p><p>Buddha initiated her into sannyas.</p><p><br></p><p>Now these two stories, Lazarus’ and Kissagautami’s, are in a way
parallel. Christ makes Lazarus alive, Buddha gives Kissagautami a new
insight into life and death itself. To a Christian, Buddha will look
phony. To a Buddhist, Jesus will look phony. What he is doing? This is
sheer nonsense! Because what happened to Lazarus then? Some day he must
have died – because we don’t see him around any more. If he was going to
die, what is the point of postponing it for few days, or few years? Why
let him go through that suffering again? – the same wife, the same
children, and the same job...</p><p><br></p><p>Lazarus, I don’t think will be able to forgive Jesus. He was resting
in his grave, feeling, “Thank God, all that nightmare is finished. Now
my wife cannot nag me any more, I am out of their reach. I don’t have to
go tomorrow morning again to the office.” But Jesus pulled him back. And
the Christian fools think this is a miracle!</p><p><br></p><p>If I had been in Lazarus’ place, I would have killed Jesus: “What are
you doing? Don’t you have any respect for anybody? Dragging somebody
back into the turmoil of life? Is it human?”</p><p><br></p><p>This gentleman says that my claim is phony. He also says that my
criticism of Mother Teresa seems to be criticism of a very ordinary man.
That is true. There I agree: I am certainly a very ordinary man – so
ordinary that you cannot even call me phony, because a phony person is
not ordinary, he’s extraordinary. I am REALLY ordinary. I have no
claims. I don’t do any miracles... And of course, he must have come with
the idea that Mother Teresa is doing great work. She is extraordinary, I
am ordinary; that’s perfectly true.</p><p><br></p><p>And I am not in any way interested in becoming extraordinary. To me,
any desire to be extraordinary is very ordinary. To be ordinary is the
only way of being extraordinary, because that is REALLY extraordinary.
Nobody wants to be ordinary.</p><p>But this gentleman must be as unconscious as, Deva Sarito, you
are.</p><p><br></p><p>Two buddies had been out drinking for hours when their money finally
ran out.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have an idea,” croaked Al. “Lesh go over to my housh and borrow
shum money from my wife.”</p><p><br></p><p>The two of them reeled into Al’s living room, snapped on the light,
and lo and behold, there was Al’s wife making love on the sofa to
another man. This state of affairs considerably unnerved Al’s friend,
but did not seem to affect the husband.</p><p><br></p><p>“Shay, dear, you have any money for your ever-lovin’ hushban’?” he
asked.</p><p><br></p><p>“Yes, yes,” she snapped. “Take my purse from the mantle, and for
Pete’s sake turn off those lights!”</p><p><br></p><p>Outside they examined the purse and Al proudly announced, “There’s
enough here for a pint for you and a pint for me. Pretty good, eh, old
buddy?”</p><p><br></p><p>“But Al,” protested his friend, somewhat sobered by the spectacle he
had just witnessed, “what about that fellow back there with your
wife?”</p><p><br></p><p>“The hell with him,” replied Al, “let him buy his own pint!”</p><p><br></p><p>Deva Sarito, All that is needed is a little more consciousness. It is
not a question of doing something; you need a new kind of being. Right
now you are unconscious; you have to be conscious. You have to be more
aware, watchful, witnessing.</p><p><br></p><p>Witnessing is the key of my sannyas, the master key. I don’t give you
any other discipline, because giving you any discipline will not help.
Your unconsciousness will be there, and the discipline will only cover
it. You can look like a saint but you will be as unconscious as before.
Your saintliness will be as unconscious as your sinfulness was; there
will be no qualitative difference in it.</p><p><br></p><p>So I am not interested in making saints out of you. I am not
interested in helping you to drop your sins either. What I am interested
is to make you aware, and the moment you start becoming aware of your
actions, your thoughts, your feelings... these are the three dimensions
awareness has to be applied. Walk, but know that you are walking. Remain
alert of each gesture. Eat but eat with awareness; don’t just go on
stuffing food inside. Think, but witness your thoughts, the process of
thoughts, desires, dreams. Feel, but remain a little aware that these
feelings, these moods are not you.</p><p><br></p><p>You are only pure awareness and nothing else. You are not the body,
nor the mind, nor the heart. You are the fourth, and the fourth is the
miracle. Once you have tasted the fourth, then wherever you are – even
in hell – but you will be in heaven.</p><p><br></p><p>The second question: Question 2</p><p>OSHO,</p><p>I AM A MEMBER OF A GROUP IN HOLLAND CALLED “THE OPEN LOTUS”, WHICH IS
GATHERED AROUND A MEDIUM WHO CLAIMS TO TRANSFER MESSAGES AND ENERGIES
FROM MASTER MORYA.</p><p><br></p><p>THIS HAS VERY MUCH AFFECTED MY HEART AND BEING WHEN I AM IN YOUR
AUDIENCE I FEEL A KIND OF MELTING, BUT MY HEART DOES NOT AS YET SEEM TO
BE SO DEEPLY TOUCHED AS IT IS WITH THE MEDIUM. WHAT IS HAPPENING?</p><p><br></p><p>IS THE EXPERIENCE WITH THE UNSEEN MASTER MORYA UNREAL AND SOMETHING
OF THE MIND? CAN IT BE A HINDRANCE TO BECOMING ONE WITH YOU, OSHO? ARE
YOU IN SUPPORT OF GROUPS LIKE THE OPEN LOTUS? IF SO, DO YOU HAVE A
MESSAGE FOR THEM?</p><p><br></p><p>MARINUS,</p><p><br></p><p>First, meditate over this story:</p><p><br></p><p>Stan and his wife, Rita, were playing the tenth hole. He teed off and
Rita hit hers into the woods.</p><p><br></p><p>Stan had not hit his ball very far on the fairway, so he went into
the woods to help her find it. Suddenly they came across a little fellow
about four feet tall with a pointed hat and green suit.</p><p><br></p><p>“Hey,” said Stan, “are you a leprechaun?” “Sure I am,” he
replied.</p><p>“Well, maybe you could grant my wish to be a scratch golfer.”</p><p><br></p><p>“All right, but you have to give up something. If you let me have
your wife in the woods for one hour, I will grant your wish.”</p><p><br></p><p>“You’ve got it!” said the husband.</p><p><br></p><p>The little guy took Rita into the woods and after an hour’s pleasure
asked, “How old is your husband?”</p><p><br></p><p>“Forty.”</p><p><br></p><p>“And he still believes in leprechauns?”</p><p><br></p><p>Marinus, how old you are? – and you still believe in Master Morya?
You must be feeling great, because if something happens according to
your belief, it strengthens the ego, it nourishes the ego. And Master
Morya is not visible, only the medium is there. And the medium is more
concerned in impressing you, so she will follow you. In fact, there is
no Master Morya anywhere. This whole idea of Master Morya was created by
the Theosophists. It is an invention of Madame Blavatsky – Madame
Blah-blah-blah. It is just fiction.</p><p>Madame Blavatsky used to receive letters from Master Morya. In the
roof there was a hole, and a servant used to hide above the roof, and
all the Marinuses, the Theosophists, will sit with closed eyes waiting
for Master Morya’s message. And Madame Blah-blah-blah will sway, and she
was really a fat lady and very ugly too. Ugly people become religious –
what else they can do? I have seen many ugly people, but Madame
Blah-blah-blah defeats all. Only some fictitious entity like Master
Morya may love her, no man – no man alive – will be able to gather so
much courage.</p><p><br></p><p>And she will sway, and she will speak gibberish – what Christians
call glossolalia – strange sounds she will make. And much incense will
be burned, and much smoke will be created so nobody could see what is
happening. And their eyes will be full of tears because of the smoke...
And then a letter will drop, and all these fools – and they were not
uneducated people, all retired magistrates, high court judges,
government officials, professors, scholars – they will wait for the
letter. And the letter will be read then by Madame Blah-Blah-Blah.</p><p><br></p><p>And great messages were received, but they were all fulfilling their
desires. Whatsoever they wanted was fulfilled. They were immensely
happy.</p><p><br></p><p>It was J. Krishnamurti who destroyed the whole game, who came out of
this nonsense and declared that, “This is all stupidity.” J.
Krishnamurti has done a great service to humanity by destroying the
theosophical nonsense. But Holland used to be one of the great centers
of theosophical movement, and still few fools go on living with the
hangover.</p><p><br></p><p>Certainly you will not feel the same here. In fact, you will feel
just the opposite because I am continuously shattering your ego, I am
hitting it hard. I am not here to nourish your ego, I am here to destroy
it. You can be one with me only if you are totally egoless, otherwise
there is no possibility.</p><p><br></p><p>If you want to enjoy your ego and your dreams and your fantasies,
then these mediums are good. But remember, you will remain childish, you
will never grow. Yes, sometimes coincidentally something may appear to
be true. If a medium says thousands of things, one thing may coincide
with reality. And the fools and the gullible immediately jump upon that
one thing, and they make much fuss about it. And they think, “If one
thing is right then others also must be right. Maybe we are not yet
capable enough to understand, maybe we need more purity. We have to
become as pure as the medium.”</p><p><br></p><p>And what the medium says, you have to interpret it, and you always
interpret according to your mind. And these Masters don’t exist at
all.</p><p><br></p><p>“I have learned one thing about women,” said the experienced one to
his drinking companions. “You just can’t trust a girl with brown
eyes.”</p><p><br></p><p>“It occurs to me,” said one of his inebriated friends, “that I have
been married nearly three years and I don’t know what color eyes my wife
has.”</p><p><br></p><p>The second man finished his drink, climbed from his stool, and
hurried home to investigate this disturbing possibility.</p><p><br></p><p>His wife was in bed asleep. He crept up to her and carefully lifted
an eyelid. “By God! Brown!” he exclaimed.</p><p>“How the hell did you know I was here?” said Brown, crawling out from
under the bed.</p><p><br></p><p>Yes, once in a while some coincidence like that will happen. Beware!
And all these mediums and all these priests and all these theosophists,
theologians – and they have many brands all around the world – they are
the most cunning people. It is better to be with a gambler, with a
drunkard, it is better to be with a so-called sinner, than to be with
these people. These people have been preventing human growth for
thousands of years. They are the most criminal people in the world.
Their crime is unpardonable.</p><p><br></p><p>A genie jumped on his ball and said, “Would you like to be the
world’s best golfer?” “I sure would,” said the man.</p><p>“Would you give up your sex life for it?” “Of course,” said the
man.</p><p>The genie granted his wish, and in the next twelve months he won
every tournament on the pro tour. After the year was up, the man was
back on the eighteenth tee, and once again the genie appeared. “How did
it feel to be the world’s best golfer?”</p><p>“Great!” said the man.</p><p><br></p><p>“Did you mind giving up your sex life?” “Not at all.”</p><p>“How often did you have sex in former years?” “Four or five times a
year,” replied the man.</p><p>“That’s not very much!”</p><p><br></p><p>“Well, it is not bad for a priest with a small parish.”</p><p><br></p><p>These priests, these rabbis, these AYATOLLAHS, these IMAMS – beware
of them. It is time that humanity should get rid of all this
stupidity.</p><p><br></p><p>Rabbi Goldstein was allowed to join a “restricted” country club. His
first day he met Peckham, the president.</p><p>“Welcome, Rabbi Goldstein. Would you like to play a round?” “Sure, we
will play a friendly game of hundred dollars a hole.” Rabbi Goldstein
lost eighteen hundred dollars.</p><p>“Look ’ said Peckham,”I will give you a chance to get even. Three
thousand six hundred dollars or nothing.”</p><p><br></p><p>Rabbi Goldstein agreed and lost again.</p><p><br></p><p>Later in the locker room, Rabbi Goldstein said, “You like to wager. I
will bet you one thousand dollars I can pee over your head from ten
feet.”</p><p><br></p><p>“All right,” said the club prexy. “But nobody can pee that far.”
Rabbi Goldstein proceeded to pee all over Peckham.</p><p>“See,” he said, after changing his clothes. “I knew you could not do
it. Come on, I will buy.”</p><p><br></p><p>At the bar they met Lockwood, the local bank chairman. “This is Rabbi
Goldstein,” said the club president. “He is one of our new members.”</p><p><br></p><p>Peckham then told Lockwood about the money he had won, including how
Rabbi Goldstein had peed all over him.</p><p><br></p><p>“Oh no!” cried the banker, “That s.o.b. bet me twenty thousand
dollars he would piss all over the president on his first day at the
club!”</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p><a href=part5>&lt; Previous</a> | <a href=_index>Contents</a> |

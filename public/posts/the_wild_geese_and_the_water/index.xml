‌CHAPTER 1
And Escape to Reality
11 February 1981 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1 OSHO,
DO YOU HAVE A MESSAGE FOR SANNYASINS AND FRIENDS GATHERING AT THE CAFE ROYAL, LONDON, FOR THE “MARCH EVENT”?
ANAND POONAM,
SANNYAS IS A REBELLION against both the past and the future. Man has either lived in the past or in the future, but never in the present.</description>

‌CHAPTER 10
The Dignity of the Poor?
20 February 1981 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1 OSHO,
THE LATEST FROM THE POPE: “DEFENDING THE HUMAN DIGNITY OF THE POOR AND THEIR HOPE FOR A HUMAN FUTURE IS NOT A LUXURY FOR THE CHURCH, NOR IS IT A STRATEGY OF OPPORTUNISM, NOR A MEANS FOR CURRYING FAVOR WITH THE MASSES. IT IS HER DUTY.</description>

‌CHAPTER 11
No Higher, No Lower
21 February 1981 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1 OSHO,
“HOLIER-THAN-THOU” SEEMS TO BE MY LIFELONG MANTRA. GROWING UP AS A CATHOLIC, I THANKED GOD DAILY THAT I WAS A PART OF THE ONE TRUE RELIGION. AS A CATHOLIC NUN I KNEW I HAD “MADE IT”. NOW, AS A SANNYASIN, I OBSERVE THOSE SAME ATTITUDES AND JUDGMENTS HAPPENING AT EVERY TURN.</description>

‌CHAPTER 12
Back to the Garden
22 February 1981 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1 OSHO,
CATHOLICISM, MOHAMMEDANISM, HINDUISM, JAINISM AND BUDDHISM, WHICH ARE THE MOST “RELIGIOUS” OF RELIGIONS, SEEM MOST CONCERNED ABOUT PURITY, CLEANLINESS AND SEXUAL ABSTINENCE. YET, THE PRESIDE OVER THE MOST UNHYGIENIC, MALNOURISHED AND MISERABLE PEOPLES OF THE EARTH. IS THERE A CONNECTION?
DEVARAJ,
THERE IS CERTAINLY AND ABSOLUTELY a tremendous connection.</description>

‌CHAPTER 13
The Immediate is the Ultimate
23 February 1981 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1 OSHO,
I AM NOT A SANNYASIN, AND I AM VISITING THE ASHRAM FOR A SHORT PERIOD. I APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT IS DONE HERE, BUT THERE IS ONE QUESTION THAT I CANNOT AVOID ASKING. THE THEORY IS NICE, BUT FROM THE DOZENS OF SANNYASINS WITH WHOM I HAVE SPOKEN, NOBODY COULD SAY, “I HAVE FOUND THE WAY, I AM PROCEEDING, AND I AM SURE ONE DAY I WILL BE ABLE TO STAND ON MY OWN FEET.</description>

The Bird has Flown
24 February 1981 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1 OSHO,
THE DUTCH TELEVISION HAS ASKED ME TO PARTICIPATE IN A PROGRAM. ONE OF THE QUESTIONS ON WHICH THEY WANT ME TO SPEAK IS AS FOLLOWS: WHAT IS LACKING IN THE CHRISTIAN CHURCHES THAT IS ATTRACTING SO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE TO THE NEW RELIGIOUS MOVEMENTS?

The christ is missing.</description>

‌CHAPTER 2
Religion is Rebellion
12 February 1981 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1 OSHO,
I HAVE HEARD THAT THE GERMAN CHANCELLOR, HELMUT SCHMIDT, DECLARED ON TELEVISION THAT SANNYASINS WERE VERY DANGEROUS PEOPLE FOR THE STATE AND SOCIETY, AND SHOULD NOT BE ENGAGED FOR PUBLIC SERVICE OR BY RESPECTABLE COMPANIES ANY MORE. LOTS OF GERMANS ARE TELEVISION-WATCHERS AND BEHAVE ACCORDING TO WHAT THE POLITICIANS SAY.</description>

The first question:
Question 1 OSHO,
WOULD YOU PLEASE SAY SOMETHING ON THE FOLLOWING WORDS OF THE POET, KAHLIL GIBRAN: “WHEN LOVE BECKONS TO YOU, FOLLOW HIM. LOVE POSSESSES NOT NOR WOULD IT BE POSSESSED, FOR LOVE IS SUFFICIENT UNTO LOVE. LOVE HAS NO DESIRE BUT TO FULFILL ITSELF.”

Soul-living by Loving

The first question:
Question 1 OSHO,
WHY IS HUGGING SUCH AN INCREDIBLY EFFECTIVE THERAPEUTIC TOOL?

MAN NEEDS TO BE NEEDED. It is one of the most fundamental needs of human beings.</description>

Life’s Complementariness
17 February 1981 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1 OSHO,
YOU OFTEN ADVISE US TO FOLLOW TWO COURSES OF ACTION THAT SEEM TO BE INCOMPATIBLE WITH EACH OTHER. FIRST YOU TELL US TO BE COMPLETELY IN THE MOMENT, WITHOUT MIND, TO BE OUR FEAR, OUR JOY, OR RAGE. THEN YOU TELL US TO BECOME DETACHED FROM OUR EGOS, TO WATCH WHAT COMES UP WITHIN OURSELVES.</description>

‌CHAPTER 9
Bon Voyage Baby!
19 February 1981 am in Buddha Hall
The first question:
Question 1 OSHO,
A FEW MONTHS AGO IN THE WEST I READ A BOOK BY LAMA TRUNGPA, ENTITLED “CUTTING THROUGH SPIRITUAL MATERIALISM”, AND I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT EVERYTHING THAT COULD BE DONE WRONG, I WAS DOING. THEN I TRIED TO BE MORE ALERT, BUT BY VOIDING ONE PITFALL I WAS CONSTANTLY STEPPING INTO ANOTHER, AND SO ON.</description>
